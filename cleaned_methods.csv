The method was conceived in an attempt to 'update' the  New England Town Meeting  format for the digital age by integrating the use of  Audience Response Systems  and similar connective technologies.[1]  Origins and DevelopmentAmericaSpeaks  was founded in 1995 by Carolyn J. Lukensmeyer “to serve as a counterweight to the influence of special interest groups in affected public policy.”[2] From its inception, AmericaSpeaks developed and tested the 21st Century method with its first large-scale application coming in 1998 during the two-year ‘ Americans Discuss Social Security ’ initiative.[3]  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Like regular Town Meetings, which are generally open to all members of the voting public,[4] 21st Century Town Meetings as run by AmericaSpeaks are open to all those interested. However, unlike the traditional Town Meeting model, AmericaSpeaks undertakes a rigorous process of  community outreach  to ensure demographic targets -- set, according to census or other relevant data -- are met.[5] Participants in 21st Century Town Meetings are intended to be ordinary citizens with no particular expertise in the topic under discussions. They are, generally speaking, not stakeholders or professional lobbyists, which AmericaSpeaks engages through using the  Stakeholder  Summits methodology.[6]  Participant outreach and registration are performed by AmericaSpeaks in partnership with grassroots organizations, service providers and community leaders.[7] Compensation in the form of free meals, childcare, transportation, and translation are often offered to overcome typical barriers to participation.[8]  At the start of a 21st Century Town Meeting, voting keypads are used to measure the demographics of attendees and publicly compare participants with that of the community.[9]  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The 21st Century Town® meeting was designed in an attempt to realize the full potential of the Open Town Meeting method: to enable every participant to meaningfully contribute during the deliberation and decision-making process.[10] To this end, participants are sat in  round tables  of 10-12 to encourage discussion and equal participation.[11] Each of these groups is moderated by a trained facilitator and a designated scribe records the proceedings on a laptop.[12] Since widespread participation is sought in these meetings, each discussion group is linked by  information and communications technologies  (ICT) to create a larger conversation of thousands of people.[13]  Process Overview  The 21st Century Town Meeting follows a four-step process similar to other public consultations or deliberative policy forums.Recruitment &amp; Organizer Preparation  Information &amp; LearningTown Hall  Meeting (Discussion and Vote)  Reporting[14]Phase I: Recruitment &amp; Organizer Preparation  In some instances, the Town Meeting is open to the public while in others, participants are randomly  selected  using stratified sampling to ensure demographics are representative of the population.[15] The latter may be used when the population contains “hard to reach” groups or individuals.[16]  Phase II: Information &amp; Learning  Participants will then receive information material by post or electronically before the discussion day in order to become familiar with the subject. The materials are designed to be balanced and non-partisan.[17]  Phase III: Town Hall Meeting (Discussion and Vote)  The core of the procedure is the town hall meeting: a short term encounter in which participants can learn about complex issues, develop their own views on those issues, and make collective decisions in a deliberative way. All participants come together at a set time, in-person at one or more locations. Meetings which take place across several locations transmit the intermediate and final results of the other events over the Internet or directly via satellite transmission.[18]  The entire session is overseen by a single host or ‘master of ceremonies’. The participants are distributed on tables of 10 to 12 participants each and discuss the topics / questions prepared by the organizer under the direction of an independent moderator. Each group follows the same agenda of discussion so that conversations run in parallel. Alongside the moderators, each table is assigned a scribe who records table discussions on a computer linked to a networked system. Using group-ware, the contents of table conversations are collected in real time and processed by a central “theme team” that attempts to discern the main viewpoints, positions, and themes that emerge at all of the tables.[19] The summaries of the results are available to all participants for comment and voting using individual electronic keypads which are distributed at the beginning of the process. The use of electronic keypads or ‘audience response systems’ is a defining feature of the 21st Century Town Meeting format. ASR allows the host to take period straw polls and votes throughout the event, and responses are not only tallied, but displayed on screens to give participants and organizers immediate feedback.  Phase IV: Reporting  Before the meeting ends, organizers create a report that contains results and recommendations that they distribute to participants, decision-makers, and media. [20]Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  While the method is not institutionalized and, therefore, does not carry the same legislative power as official New England Town Meetings or other local forums, it has provided an adaptable process, organized and executed by trained facilitators. According to a blog post by AmericaSpeaks on the  National Coalition of Dialogue &amp; Deliberation ’s website, the method promises to deliver on some or all of the following:“Diverse Representation: AmericaSpeaks is committed to ensuring that the rich diversity of the community is well represented in the process. We will tailor a strategy in collaboration with our local partners, to recruit participants and reach our established targets.  Informed Participation: AmericaSpeaks will work with local partners to provide participants with accessible materials that frame the issues involved and provide a baseline of data upon which participants may begin their discussions. This framing process may involve identifying a series of “tough choices” that must be made by the public in order to address the area’s challenges.  Facilitated Deliberation: Every person who participates in an AmericaSpeaks town meeting plays an active role in the deliberations. Every voice is heard and no ideas are lost. The AmericaSpeaksteam will recruit and train skilled table facilitators to ensure high quality dialogue.  Clear Priorities: AmericaSpeaks’ town meetings foster consensus among participants and identify shared priorities. Our use of technology will support participants in identifying community-wide priorities out of a true discussion. As themes emerge from the discussions, they will be reported back to the group on large screens and voted on using keypads.  Link to Action: AmericaSpeaks designs our citizen engagement initiatives to create the conditions needed to produce meaningful action and change. The AmericaSpeaks team will craft the scale, composition and design of the citizen engagement strategy to build credibility with policy makers, the media, key stakeholders and the public as a whole.”[21] The process has been used to engage over 165,000 people in dialogues ranging from city planning to budget setting in all 50 states in the contiguous US.[22] The process has also been replicated by other organizations and bodies, such as the UK Department of Health.[23] While not all of these Meetings have resulted in policy change or government action, they have helped communities set priorities and come to a shared understanding of various issues.[24]Analysis and Lessons Learned  The following analysis comes from a report by Carolyn Lukensmeyer, Founder and President of AmericaSpeaks:  ""Given its technological features and an elaborate preparatory process, the 21st Century Town Meeting is a resource intensive process. Those organizations without access to financial resources would not be able to replicate the method in their local settings. On account of past and perhaps futile or fruitless experiences with traditional methods of government consultation, many participants may feel sceptical about the outcomes. Overcoming this deep rooted distrust between citizens and their government is often not an easy task. Some [o]ther crucial challenges include providing adequate information as fairly represented and as unbiased as possible; dealing with the complexity of political environments and policy regimes; gaining support of political leaders owing to the criticality of their involvement and commitment; being watchful of special/vested interest groups occupying the center stage and subverting the process; and implementing a well targeted outreach plan to ensure a diverse mix of participants with special reference to those who are generally marginalized.”[25]  One of the benefits of 21st Century Town Meetings compared to individual, small group deliberations is its ability to produce a coherent set of goals or vision among a large group of people. After the ‘Listening to the City’ 21st Century Town Meeting on New York’s post 9/11 development, President of the Regional Plan Association, Robert Yaro, praised the process, stating that “[t]here had been smaller meetings of neighborhood residents and of families, but it was the first time that all of the stakeholders had a chance to be there and to listen to each other [...] You began to see an emerging consensus on what the priorities needed to be in rebuilding.”[26] In her analysis of Listening to the City for Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government Case Program, Susan Rosegrant supports Yaro’s observation. She notes that, while clear differences in beliefs existed between participants at the outset of the process, “[a]s conversations developed through the day, however, a surprising degree of agreement emerged regarding priorities and values that should have guided the reconstruction effort, but that apparently didn’t.”[27]  While AmericaSpeaks is clear that 21st Century Town Meetings are ‘linked to action’,[28] the process is not institutionalized and its participants are not given decision-making power. Indeed, according to Rosengrant’s report on Listening to the City, “despite the strong consensus of the group, and the genuineness with which officials appeared to listen, many participants doubted that anything had been accomplished. When asked at the end of the meeting whether they believed decision makers would take their input seriously, only one-third of voters said they were confident or very confident they would do so.”[29] However, the lack of decision-making power granted to participants and the non-binding nature of the decisions on policy makers are overcome through several design features of the process. According to AmericaSpeak’s Carolyn Lukensmeyer and Steven Birgham in their article “Taking Democracy to Scale: Large Scale Interventions - for Citizens,” the influence of a 21st Century Town Meeting on public officials largely a function of process design. According to their article, “the overall strategy developed for a town meeting must incorporate ways to prompt and track systemic change among decision makers and a renewed sense of agency among participants. There must be an avenue by which a citizen can continue to pursue the issue.”[30]  See AlsoAmericaSpeaksNew England Town MeetingShaping America's Youth 21st Century Town Meetings on Child ObesityReferences[1]  “21st Century Town Meeting,”  America Speaks.

These programs create opportunities for engaging, educating, and empowering citizens, which can foster a more vibrant civil society. Participatory budgeting also helps promote transparency, which has the potential to reduce government inefficiencies and corruption. Because most citizens who participate have low incomes and low levels of formal education, participatory budgeting offers citizens from historically excluded groups the opportunity to make choices that will affect how their government acts. Put simply, participatory budgeting programs provide poor and historically excluded citizens with access to important decision-making venues.[1]  Origins and DevelopmentGenesis in Porto AlegreParticipatory budgeting began in  1989 in the municipality of Porto Alegre , the capital of Brazil’s southernmost state, Rio Grande do Sul (see  Porto Alegre Participatory Budgeting ). Porto Alegre has more than 1 million inhabitants and is wealthy by Brazilian standards. In 1988, the Workers’ Party, a progressive political party founded during the waning years of the 1964–85 military dictatorship, won the mayoral election. Its campaign was based on democratic participation and the “inversion of spending priorities”—that is, the reversal of a decades-long trend in which public resources were spent in middle- and upper-class neighborhoods. Participatory budgeting was intended to help poorer citizens and neighborhoods receive larger shares of public spending.  When the Workers’ Party won the mayor’s office in Porto Alegre, it inherited a bankrupt municipality and a disorganized bureaucracy. During its first two years in office, the new administration experimented with different mechanisms to tackle financial constraints, provide citizens with a direct role in the government’s activities, and invert the social spending priorities of previous administrations. Participatory budgeting was born through this experimental process.  In 1989 and 1990, the first two years of participatory budgeting, fewer than 1,000 citizens participated in the participatory budgeting process; by 1992 the number of participants had jumped to nearly 8,000. After the Workers’ Party was re-elected in 1992, the program took on a life of its own, with participation increasing to more than 20,000 people a year. Participation grew as citizens realized that participatory budgeting was an important decision-making venue.[1]Experimentation in Latin AmericaThroughout the 1990s, participatory budgeting spread to other municipalities in Brazil and to other countries in South America, including Bolivia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Peru. In his analysis of experiments in participatory budgeting in Latin America, Benjamin Goldfrank identified several factors that can contribute to its success:the mayor is indigenous, from a party on the left, or both;  opposition from local political elites is weak or nonexistent;  national or international aid organizations provide project funding, technical assistance, or both;  the municipality has sufficient revenues to make significant investments in public works or programs;  there is a tradition of participation and cooperation within and among local civic associations or indigenous customary organizations that has not been destroyed by guerrilla warfare or clientelist politics.[3]Spread throughout the WorldFrom the late 1990s, participatory budgeting in different formats has begun to take root in Central and Eastern Europe[4], Asia,[5], Sub-Saharan Africa[6], the Middle East and North Africa.[4]  In 2007, participatory budgeting became a formal strand of government policy in the UK.  Participant Recruitment and SelectionKnow how participants are recruited for this method? Help uscomplete this section! How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The UK's  Participatory Budgeting Unit  reports that, as participatory budgeting is quite new, innovative forms of participatory budgeting are being developed all the time and new budgets, new themes, new partners, different areas are demonstrating that participatory budgeting is possible and beneficial for a wide range of services and areas.  The participatory budgeting process usually requires citizen engagement in the various phases of a budget cycle to identify the capital investments and projects to address the most pressing local needs.  Participatory budgeting involves citizens, councillors and local government officers working together. Participatory budgeting aims to include those who are not traditionally engaged in policy decisions. As well as citizen involvement, participatory budgeting creates opportunities for greater efficiency in the allocation of public funds and increased community cohesion.  The main features of participatory budgeting include:a geographically defined area such as a local authority, a decentralised district of a local authority, or a defined neighbourhood  regularly scheduled meetings and debates in each geographical unit  a cycle of activities closely following the local budgeting cycle  a network of individuals and organisations involved in training, informing and mobilising local citizenThere is no universal way of applying participatory budgeting. Methodologies vary from area to area but typically it involves allocating between two to three percent of the annual revenue budgets and sometimes the allocation of new investments. The process involves citizens taking into account both the demand and supply of services and public infrastructure. In the UK, participatory budgeting has mainly been applied to allocating resources for area regeneration and for directing statutory funds to voluntary sector organisations.[2] Paolo Spada, a member of Participedia's core development team, describes the participatory budgeting process as follows:  ""Most [initiatives] have at least two channels, one open to all, one for super participants that uses some sort of selection method. In the US people volunteer, in some places they are randomly selected generating a mix between the traditional minipublic and PB, [while] in all Latin America they are elected. These people [super participants] in the US are called budget delegates and they are the ones that take the raw ideas and improve them in collaboration with the organizers (city staff or NGO depending on location) and then create the ballot on which everybody else is called to vote. So think 3 phases: 1) brainstorming (open to all), 2) filtering (open to super participants) 3) vote (open to all). Note lastly that in big cities PB is decentralized so there are two layers of representatives, the one in the districts and the one at the city level. The theory of multichannel engagement emerged from PB because it was an ante-litteram participatory system combining multiple participatory spaces for different publics.""  Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsCase StudiesUK Local CouncilsLocal councils in the UK began to experiment with participatory budgeting, or ""community kitties"" as it was sometimes known, around 2006 in places such as:Coedpoeth in North Wales[7]  Harrow in London[8]  Bradford in Yorkshire[9].In 2007, the national Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG) published jointly with the Local Government Association their 'An Action Plan for Community Empowerment: Building on success'[10] In March 2008, CLG published a consultation document 'Participatory Budgeting: a draft national strategy'[11] which stated its ambition for ""ambition for participatory budgeting in all local authority areas by 2012"". The UK Government's White Paper 'Communities in control: Real people, real power'[12] committed to a new 'Duty to Involve' for local councils which came into effect on 1 April 2009 as part of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007.[13]Arts in UKA recent study by  Involve, UK  and the  Participatory Budgeting Unit, Manchester, UK  looked at the impact of participatory budgeting on the arts in the UK.[14] The study found that arts projects fare well in the small-grant, community-focused form of participatory budgeting. The projects most likely to succeed are those that are seen to benefit the community directly, provide value for money, are easy to understand and appeal to voters’ emotional response. The study also found that participatory budgeting can bring a number of benefits for the local arts sector, including:new funding opportunities  better informed decision making  public support and ownership of publicly funded arts  raising the public profile of the arts  educating people about the value of the arts  helping art organisations get funding from elsewhere  improving relationships between artists and communities.The report argues that the arts sector should take note of participatory budgeting for two reasons: as a source of learning for arts organisations seeking to carry out their own public involvement work, and as a new, important phenomenon, which may have a significant impact on how arts funding is distributed in the future.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Goldfrank offered an analysis of participatory budgeting in Latin America, contrasting various aspects of process design with the results achieved. The design factors were: how formal or informal the process was (i.e. was it reserved for formal associations to participate or could anyone join in?) and the level of decision-making power of the participants (i.e. whether the participants debate and decide on spending priorities, how much of the budget is affected by these decisions, and whether authorities respect the decisions). The success criteria were: participation rate, level of expansion/redistribution of services and transparency. Goldfrank concluded that there is ""some support for the assertion that outcomes tend to be better where participatory budgeting is less formalized and more deliberative...where the structures were less formal, participants had more decision-making power, participation rates were higher, policies were more redistributive, and government was more transparent.""[3]  The  European Institute for Public Participation [15] is working with the  Participatory Budgeting Unit, Manchester, UK  and the UK Government's  Department for Communities and Local Government  to develop a framework for the evaluation of participatory budgeting, along with other forms of public participation in the UK.[16]  See AlsoParticipatory Budgeting in Berlin-Lichtenberg Presupuesto Participativo: Rosario Participatory Budgeting Case Studies on ParticipediaReferences↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 Wampler, Brian. 2007. ‘ A Guide to Participatory Budgeting ’. in Shah, Anwar (ed.).

As a polling method, the Deliberative Poll seeks to account for the preferences and opinions of citizens both before and after they have had an opportunity to arrive at considered judgements based on information and exposure to the views of fellow citizens.[1] The technique was first developed by Professor James Fishkin of Stanford University in 1988, and has been adopted by local and regional governments across the world – including Canada,  the United States ,  Greece , Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary,  the United Kingdom , Brazil and  China .[2] In these diverse settings, it has been used as a more accurate means of polling the public, as a method of developing citizen preferences on difficult issues, as a mode of selecting candidates to run in competitive elections, and as a policy tool to direct political officials in public planning efforts.  A method related to deliberative polling are  Citizen Dialogues .  Fishkin initially designed the Deliberative Poll in response to perceived defects of modern public opinion polling methods.[3] Fishkin’s main problem was with high levels of citizen-ignorance on many public issues that required substantive background knowledge in order to take an informed position. In these scenarios, citizens have an incentive for ‘rational ignorance’ – that is, they have an incentive to remain ignorant about an issue because the costs (such as time, energy, etc.) of educating themselves outweigh the benefits of doing so. When the incentives for rational ignorance in the general population are high, traditional sample surveys of mass public opinion will often turn up ‘non-attitudes’ or so-called ‘phantom opinions’ on many public questions. This means that ordinary polling techniques will offer, at best, a snapshot of public opinion under conditions where the public has little information, attention, or interest in a given issue.[4]  Given the problems for accurate opinion sampling under conditions of rational ignorance, Deliberative Polling is meant to offer a representation of what the public would think about a specific issue under ‘ideal conditions’ – that is, under conditions in which citizens have access to fair and balanced background information, are able to account for the different opinions of fellow citizens, and can interact with expert panels of policy-makers to understand the tradeoffs of different policy positions.[5]  Origins and Development  Fishkin first proposed the idea of a Deliberative Poll in an article published in Atlantic Monthly in August 1988.[6] The article was later developed into a book in 1991 entitled ‘Democracy and Deliberation: New Directions for Democratic Reform'.[7] In both works, Fishkin consistently draws upon two primary inspirations in setting out a viable model for a Deliberative Poll: notions of direct democracy exhibited most prominently in the classical Athenian practice of government; and, the foundational work of George Gallup, whose pioneering work on modern opinion polling still forms the basis of most modern polling practices.  The first parallel Fishkin draws, is between his Deliberative Polling proposal and the democratic practices of ancient Athens. According to Fishkin, the Deliberative Poll directly appropriated two distinct features of the Athenian model of democracy: first, citizens were selected to participate in Athenian institutions through a lottery, which Deliberative Polling replicates by relying on the method of  random selection ; and, second, Athenian citizens were typically remunerated for participating, which is a principle that Deliberative Polls also utilize in order to ensure that a more representative microcosm of the public is constructed by encouraging participant heterogeneity.[8]  Fishkin combines the Athenian model for democratic participation with the public opinion polling methods of Gallup. According to Fishkin, Gallup had originally developed public opinion polling with a view to restoring the intimate face-to-face model of democracy of the  New England town meeting  to the larger state. Figuratively, Gallup had argued that citizens should regularly gather together, make and hear arguments from political leaders to the public, and vote for or against policy proposals directly. In this context, the public opinion poll was seen as completing the political conversation by carrying the public’s views back to political leaders.[9] The problem, however, is that often times respondents to opinion polls are unable to give well thought out answers or informed opinions about an issue – leading to polls becoming an instrument of political elites rather than an empowering democratic procedure. Deliberative Polling, ideally, is supposed to narrow the gap between well-informed and actual public opinion.[10]  The first ever Deliberative Polling experiment was held on April 15, 1994 in  Manchester, England . A randomly selected sample of 301 British citizens participated in the event, and over the next two days considered and discussed a range of policy proposals to deal with crime. During the event, participants met, deliberated in small group-sessions and then put  questions to and heard answers  from a panel of experts and representatives of the Conservative, Labour, and Liberal Democratic parties. At the end of  deliberation day , participants were then asked to once more provide their opinions, which were recorded and later broadcast in a two-hour television special shown on Britain’s ‘Channel 4’. The Poll was viewed as largely successful, with before and after opinion poll results showing that almost half of participants change their initial positions: nearly 40 percent adopted a more moderate position, and some 10 to 15 percent switched sides completely.[11]  As of 2008, there have been more than 50 deliberative polls around the world. Eleven face-to-face polls have been national – with five of those in Britain (on crime, Britain’s role in Europe, the future of the monarchy, the 1997 general election, and reform of the National Health Service). Other polls have been conducted in Denmark (on the question of adopting the Euro), in Bulgaria (on crime), Australia (one on Australia becoming a republic, and another  on Aboriginal reconciliation ), and the United States (one on foreign policy, the American family, and economic policy, and another on foreign policy in the lead up to the second Iraq war). Thirty-nine of the polls have also occurred at the regional and local level in both the United States and China (notably, in 2005 on  participatory budgeting  in  Wenling City  and another similar poll in the same city in 2008).[12] While most Deliberative Polling experiments have been face-to-face, two successful polls have also been conducted on-line – although they still took place in ‘real time’ and used microphones so that participants could hear their fellow deliberators.[13]  Fishkin has registered both ‘Deliberative Poll’ and ‘Deliberative Polling' as trademarks in order to supervise the quality of polling experiments, as well as raise funds for further research and application of the method through the  Center for Deliberative Democracy at Stanford University . Fishkin has also served in an advisory role on all polls conducted to date.[14]  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Citizens are usually invited to participate in a Deliberative Poll through a process of random selection. The random selection process can occur in either one of two ways: through random digit dialing; or, by sending out ‘warm-up’ letters to a random sample of phone listings and followed up with phone calls. In order to mitigate problems of selection bias, several calls are made to each phone number to ensure that the sample does not just include those easiest to reach (such as retirees). Once contacted, interviewers use several techniques – such as asking for the person with the next birthday – to ensure that the sample also does not bias those who most often answer the household phone (statistically, more often women). Those who agree to participate may receive follow-up phone calls or informational mailing to ensure their commitment. In addition, more targeted phone calls may be made to encourage participation among people of demographics less like to the actual polling event (such as those with less education, or those living in remote areas).[15]  While there are no ceilings to the maximum number of participants that could be included in a Deliberative Poll, most polling experiments have had between 130 to approximately 450 participants. Participants are also typically paid between 75-200 $US per-day to partake in the deliberation event. While potentially costly to sponsoring organizations, the use of a monetary incentive encourages people of lower socioeconomic status to attend, allowing for a more heterogeneous participant pool and a better representative sample of the larger public.[16]  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  While an ordinary poll is designed to show what the public actually thinks about a set of issues, a Deliberative Poll is designed to show what the public would think about those issues if given time for earnest reflection and access to more complete information. Because the focus is on constructing a sample of a hypothetical public attitude, however, the actual Deliberative Polling event has to be highly structured and well organized. Conveners must have access to extensive technical expertise to recruit participants, compose background-briefing materials, and enter and analyze resulting  survey  data. They also must have sufficient civic resources to pay and train aides and moderators able to ensure a nonpartisan approach to deliberations and discussions, organize the event itself, facilitate media coverage, and disseminate the polling results.[16]  The distinctive procedural features of this polling method include a random sample, balanced background materials, and a series of formal  surveys  or questionnaires. While the length of deliberation during the actual ‘event’ may vary, in general, deliberations occur over of the course of one or two days. Prior to the event, prospective participants are required to fill out an initial questionnaire and, once returned, are sent background materials that present a range of information and perspectives on the questions under consideration.[17]  During the day(s) of deliberation, participants are informed they are being assembled as a representative cross-section of the larger public. Ideally, providing this information to participants encourages them to adopt an attitude more orientated towards consideration of the potential public, rather than personal, benefits that might result from a particular policy option. That said, appealing to narrower reasons in advocating a specific policy position is not illegitimate. The content of what participants are allowed to say in group-sessions is not restricted, nor is the language in which opinions are articulated. They are also not instructed to stick to the use of logical argument, refrain from personal narratives, or to refer only to the ‘common good’.[18] There are also no formal limits placed on how long an individual may speak, although moderators are instructed to ensure that all participants are allowed to have a voice in deliberations.  Generally speaking, the process of conducting a Deliberative Poll, including the proceedings on the day(s) of deliberation, can be broken down into a five-step process:[19]A random, representative sample of the public is contacted and asked to provide feedback on an initial questionnaire aimed at evaluating the knowledge, perceptions, and preferences of the general public on a specific question.  Another random representative sample of citizens are contacted and asked to participate in a ‘deliberative event’ to be held over the course of one or two days.  In the lead up to the event, selected participants receive balanced briefing materials vetted by a panel of experts pertaining to the topics to be discussed.  On the day of the deliberative event, participants are randomly assigned to small groups with trained moderators. During the group-sessions, the participants are encouraged to develop questions to pose a panel of experts and policymakers at a plenary session held towards the end of the event.  The event concludes with all participants filling out a second questionnaire intended to capture their considered opinions on the topic at hand. The results of the first poll are compared to the final poll, and any changes in opinion are measured and analyzed by trained pollsters. In most cases, the findings of the final survey are disseminated to the public through media coverage and, in some cases, form the basis of further debate and deliberations by politicians and policy-makers.Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  The opinion data produced from Deliberative Polling experiments have been used to various ends – depending on the original agenda of sponsoring organizations, the extent of media coverage, and whether or not the events results are connected directly to political policy-making processes.[20] In most cases, however, the most productive outcome of Deliberative Polling events has been the perceived strength and accuracy of the survey data when compared to other polling methods. Given that citizens are articulating ‘consider judgments’ this data has been considered more legitimate by policy-makers attempting to gauge public support for different, often difficult, policy decisions.  As a  survey  method, the opinion projection data obtained through Deliberative Polling techniques are intended to provide a more accurate representation of public sentiment on a given issue. The accuracy of the data obtained when comparing the initial ‘baseline’ survey to the data obtained from the final ‘exit’ survey following deliberations has been found to be enhanced when deliberations are prolonged over multiple days rather than just a single one.[21] Nevertheless, in both single and multi-day events the representative microcosm of participants has been found to be highly representative, both attitudinally and demographically, as compared to census data about the entire population.  Almost every Deliberative Polling experiment conducted thus far has also resulted in a number of large and statistically significant changes of opinion following the deliberative event. Considering the results of all Deliberative Polling experiments together, on average about two-thirds of the opinion items have changed following  deliberation .[22] Consequently as an opinion poll, the considered judgments arrived at following deliberation have been argued to be superior (and are often different from) the expressed attitudes solicited through conventional polls.ExamplesTo date, a number of Deliberative Polling experiments have been conducted with varying degrees of scope for the complexity of the public issues being discussed, the scale of deliberative events (including number of participants, and ties to future policy outcomes. Some notable recent cases include:Zeguo, Wenling City, China  (April 2005 and February 20 08):The government of Zeguo used a Deliberative Polling technique to garner public feedback on a series of difficult budgetary allotment decisions that needed to be made for proposed infrastructure projects. Of the entire population of Zeguo, 275 people were randomly selected to participate in surveys and deliberations taking place throughout the months of March and April, 2005. On April 30, 2005 the results of the poll were presented to Zeguo’s local People’s Congress for further debate and deliberation by local politicians – a majority of whom voted to fund the top twelve projects ranked in the Deliberative Poll. After encouraging results from the first Poll held in 2005, a second was held in the Zeguo Township in February 2008 and opened the entire budget to participatory feedback.[23]Marousi, Greece  (June 2006):The PASOK, one of Greece’s two major political parties, decided to apply a Deliberative Polling method to select its candidate for mayor in the City of Marousi. A representative sample of 153 citizens from the area were asked to come together and deliberate over six possible candidates, consider their records, pose questions, and at the end provide an advisory survey that ended up constituting the PASOK’s official candidate decision. This was the first time an organization employed Deliberative Polling in order to increase the democratic legitimacy of closed party primaries.[24]Omagh, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom  (January 2007):A random sample of parents representing the entire province was brought together to deliberate public educational policy. Held on January 27, 127 parents – both Protestant and Catholic – came together to deliberate in small-group discussions and plenary sessions with panels of experts. This was the first Deliberative Poll ever to be used in a so-called ‘deeply divided society’.[25]Sofia, Bulgaria (April 2007):A national Deliberative Poll was convened by the Bulgarian government to survey considered opinion on changes in policy towards the countries Roma population, issues of crime, and education. The survey sampled 255 residents drawn from around the country and found a statistically significant change towards support for adopting a more integrationist perspective on these issues.[26]San Mateo County, California, United States  (March 2008):Sponsored by a coalition of civic groups in the county called ‘ Threshold 2008 ’, a Deliberative Poll was used to survey opinion on the issue of housing shortages. From March 15-16 a weekend sample of 238 participants considered competing policy perspectives, questioned experts, and provided input into a Countywide Assembly on Housing Choices.[27]Brussels, Belgium (May 2009):A deliberative policy organization, ' EuroPolis ', brought together 350 citizens from across the 27 European Union member states for a three-day dialogue in which participants considered issues of climate change and immigration in the EU. Deliberating in 21 languages, participants discussed issues, read detailed briefing materials, and questioned competing experts and politicians. Occurring just prior to EU parliamentary elections, the result was the first ‘European-wide’ Deliberative Polling event.[28]Porto Alegre, Rio Grande du Sol State, Brazil (June 2009):A Deliberative Poll was held to solicit state-wide opinion on the issue of career reform in the civil service as the government sought to move away from a ‘years in service’ criterion for promotion. The polling event was held over two-day period, from June 5-7, with participants engaging in small group discussions and dialogue with competing policy experts. The results of the poll were presented to the state government on August 25, and will inform the government’s legislative proposals during the next session.[29]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The Deliberative Polling technique remains in a relative stage of infancy as a method for public consultation. The exact methods of the poll have often been refined and modified to suit particular questions, events, or contexts with each version having distinct advantages and disadvantages.  In analyzing the results of various Deliberative Polling experiments completed to date, Fishkin has argued the there are four key findings. First, participants’ opinions at the end of the process often substantially change from the beginning in comparison with control groups or other surveys of the population. Second, given the information provided to participants prior to deliberation, those who participate are often more informed after the polling process is completed. Third, these changes of opinion are, in most cases, associated with processes of learning as participants begin to alter their views in response to increased information on a topic. Finally, the emphasis placed on deliberation and discussion during the polling process has had the effect of increasing citizens’ feelings of efficacy and engagement with the political process as a whole.[30]  Fishkin’s findings do differ depending on the level and scope of a given Deliberative Polling experiment. When Deliberative Polling has been used on the national level, it has had the advantage of creating a fairly diverse microcosm of an entire country, ready to confront trade-offs and divisive issues, and providing a guide to others looking to follow informed opinion. This has been particularly true in instances, such as Manchester in 1994, where the polling event is combined with a national broadcast and extensive media coverage.[31] Through widespread dissemination of polling results, citizens who did not participate in deliberations have a chance to access the conclusions and key concerns of deliberators and use them as a guide for their own political behavior. Such events are incredibly expensive, however, and most often Deliberative Polls have been far less ambitious and benefit from operating on a more local level where the face-to-face interactions fostered in the poll can be followed up with broader and more informal discussions at a later date.[32]  However, where Deliberative Polling events are widely covered by the media many critics have argued that the final survey data produced by the poll by be seriously flawed. As Robert Shapiro points out, for instance, The Deliberative Poll can only project what public opinion (more broadly construed) can look like under certain tightly controlled conditions.[33] Everett C. Ladd has added to skepticism about the accuracy of survey data obtained through multiple polling events, by pointing out that the judgements arrived at by participants in Deliberative Polls are likely to be influenced by the ‘Hawthorne effect’.[34] Under controlled conditions subjects have been known to improve in the aspect of their behavior being experimentally measured simply in response to the fact that they are being studied, and not in response to any particular experimental manipulation. In Deliberative Polling events – many of which have received a fair amount of media attention – there has been considerable worry that the judgements reached by participants may display biases of precisely this type, with subjects responding to the spotlight rather than increased knowledge about the subject.[35]  Rather than representing an accurate picture of considered public opinion, Fishkin has also argued that Deliberative Polling might also achieve the creation of a counterfactual opinion – that is, that poll results can represent a projection that has recommending force when disseminated to the broader public. Put this way, a counterfactual representation of public opinion might suggest to the rest of the population some conclusions about a specific issue that they ought to take seriously because it comes from a relatively trustworthy proxy.[36] This is relatively different use of the method than the one first recommended by Fishkin in attempting to correct conventional opinion polls, but it is also a role recent experiments in places such as Greece, Brazil, and China have pushed Deliberative Polling towards.

It is a variation of the Theater of the Oppressed method developed by Augusto Boal. Forum theatre takes the form of a conventional play but reflects the community’s lived experience of a chosen issue and culminates in unresolved crisis within that context. This play is then presented to the broader public in a participatory format such that the knowledge, aspirations and capacities of this public may be brought to bear on the exploration of viable solutions on the stage. After observing the play, a first time, the play is performed again; audience members are invited to stop the play at any point, replace a character whose experience they feel they understand, and attempt to change the course of dramatic action. In this way, spectators are transformed into “spect-actors”, not only observing but truly acting to change the scenes they are presented.[1]  Each project is stimulated by a specific community’s experience of disempowerment, struggle, and the desire for creative solutions and capacity-building through egalitarian means. The method is designed to build and/or develop most, if not all, of the following:Trust  Spontaneity and creativity  Collaboration  Listening and awareness  Communication  Effective interaction  Confidence and Capacity  Information and education  Problem-solving  Incitement to change vs catharsis  Community developmentSeveral goals and values structure and guide this work. First and foremost, it is designed to be about, by and for communities struggling with oppression – though what is experienced as oppression is left open to definition by the community in question.[2] Whether addressing the dynamics and effects of racism, addiction or domestic violence, whether speaking to external or internal obstacles and pressures, Forum Theatre is “subjunctive theatre,”[3] in which “a spectator intervenes and changes the vision of the world as it is into a world as it could be.”[4] It is designed to provide the tools with which to observe, analyse and change one’s reality; to understand underlying power relations, mechanisms and root causes of various forms of oppression and experiment in their transformation at the interpersonal level.  From this overarching framework stem other goals and purposes. As a vehicle for empowerment and community dialogue, Forum Theatre works through dialectic rather than didactic means. It is designed to “pose good questions, but the audience must supply the answers.” As Boal states, “it is not the place of the theatre to show the correct path, but only to offer the means by which all possible paths may be examined.”[5] Actors and audience alike “learn together,” as people are given the opportunity to explore, rehearse and test various possible solutions to proposed dilemmas on the stage.[6] In so doing, it tries to create the conditions within which marginalized communities might shake off some of the “ideology of expertise” and discover, develop and validate local knowledge and critical capacity.[7]  This also alludes to a third aim of Forum Theatre: the development of expressive capacities and access of information beyond the merely verbal. While Forum Theatre is designed primarily to stimulate community discussion, this discussion is carried out through action. By inviting ""spect-actors"" to act out rather than merely describe their proposed solutions, Forum Theatre can explore and test these proposals such that both their hidden presumptions and unexpected consequences might be discovered and explored: “Often a person is very revolutionary when in a public forum he envisages and advocates revolutionary and heroic acts; on the other hand, he often realizes that things are not so easy when he himself has to practice what he suggests.”[8] Moreover, many of the games and exercises that are used during the  workshop /rehearsal phase of Forum are designed to help community participants access and develop various modes of perception, expression and knowledge beyond those of conventional dialogue: the body, the image, the sonic, and the kinetic.  A fourth normative goal of Forum Theatre is to enable clearer observation and reflection of everyday dynamics and dilemmas. As theatre allows audiences to examine more closely the various underlying forces, relations, motivations, and root causes behind lived experience, it provides a context for deepening understanding and imagining unexplored alternatives.[9] Forum Theatre maximizes on this capacity by enabling not only audience observation but also interaction with and transformation of what is observed: its participatory format is a “mirror which we can penetrate to modify our image”[10] to become “protagonists of [our] own lives.”[11]  This leads into a fifth major goal of Forum Theatre: the rehearsal of various forms of action within the safe space of the theatre prepares participants for action beyond the theatre. In examining the complexity of a given issue and possible strategies for effective response, Forum theatre “trains [people] for real action”, ideally awakening a sense of heightened capacity, creativity and desire to carry such practice into one’s own life.[12]  Origins and Development  Forum Theatre was most originally developed by Brazilian popular educator, cultural activist, dramatist, director, and city councillor Augusto Boal in 1973 as part of a Peruvian literacy program. Over 40 years later, it is now practiced in schools, factories, prisons, and beyond in over 70 countries to address an even broader range of political issues. Rooted in the Brazilian social movements of the 1950s and 1960s and based on Paolo Freire’s model of participatory education in Pedagogy of the Oppressed, it is designed to represent experiences of social and political oppression in order to stimulate community dialogue and problem-solving. In this way, it is part of a larger category of methods called  participatory arts . It is most reflective of Boal’s critical pedagogy known as Theatre of the Oppressed and reflects this particular framework; however, it is flexible enough to be useful within even broader contexts.  Boal himself was arrested, tortured and exiled by the Brazilian in 1971 for his cultural work, and as a consequence systematized and taught his methodology largely during his years abroad in Paris. Multiple Centres for Theatre of the Oppressed and affiliated companies were established internationally during this time, to be brought back to Brazil with Boal’s return in 1986 following the removal of the military junta. Theatre of the Oppressed has since continued to expand exponentially as it is adopted by practitioners and communities worldwide; Forum Theatre remains its most central component.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Performers might be professional actors, although it is more common that they be drawn from the community affected by the given issue. Forum performances are always staged for community audiences.  The community members involved might be preformed and invite a Forum practitioner in to address a certain issue; this is commonly preferred, as it ensures the community is committed to exploring the issue and participating in the Forum process. However, projects have also been started with a specific issue already in mind; in these cases, community organizations and leaders might be enlisted to recruit community members for participation. In this case, the particular aspects of the issue ultimately presented within the Forum play are still chosen by the participants rather than the practitioner.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Preparation  Forum Theatre, whether a process of a 6-day  workshop  or many months, has three distinct phases. The first is designed to integrate the group, familiarize participants with the vocabulary of theatre, and increase their expressive capacity. The second introduces more issue-oriented activities to explore various perspectives and prepare the scenes to be presented. The third is the performance of the Forum play and facilitated interaction with the public. [13] Where the process is longer than the workshop itself, the workshop serves to gather information that is applied and distilled during a rehearsal phase that can last several weeks. Here, a more complex, lengthy production is possible, as opposed to the sketches that emerge at the end of a workshop. The theme chosen for presentation is never imposed by the facilitator but rather emerges from the group, as this is seen to be vital to “a theatre which liberates.”[14]  During the first and second phases, usually in the first four days of the Community Workshop, Forum Theatre uses many of the techniques developed within the Theatre of the Oppressed “arsenal”, consisting of exercises and games.[15] Exercises are those activities involving physical movement – respiratory, motor, or vocal – which help develop a better understanding of one’s body and its relation to space and other bodies. Games are activities that involve aspects of dialogue, and work to move participants beyond automatic ways of perceiving and responding to reality and awaken creative capacities. These are divided into the categories of “feel what we touch”, “listen to what we hear”, “see what we look at”, stimulate all the senses”, and “understand what we say and hear.”[16] It is important to note that these preparatory phases are seen as integral rather than merely preparatory, as they can contribute in themselves to building problem-solving abilities, consensus, capacity, and community: “in this context, every exercise, every game, every technique is both art and politics.”[17] Games and exercises are open to adaptation according to group needs or restrictions.[18]  An important technique used during the second phase of Forum Theatre and often used alone is that of Image Theatre. This is used to reveal underlying truths and commonalities within a community without initially resorting to spoken language. Participants sculpt their own or others’ bodies as “intelligent clay” to represent images from their experiences, feelings and perspectives.[19] These are then dynamized or brought to life via movement or sound to discover the motivations inherent in them.[20] Image Theatre can be used to access subconscious feelings or thoughts by bypassing “the censorship of the brain” so overdeveloped where language is concerned.[21] It is also useful in its ability to render multiple, often related meanings beyond the intention of the sculptor, realizing latent connections. It is also a creative method to explore the feasibility of possible transitions between actual and ideal scenarios when directly juxtaposed in physical form.[22] It is also effective in generating a means of communication for those who are usually excluded or intimidated through language. Lastly, in traditional Image Theatre, the group may adjust a certain image until  consensus  is reached that it is an accurate representation, contributing to consensus-building within the group.  Performance  Once a play is prepared through this process, it is then presented to the public as Forum Theatre. An early incarnation of Forum Theatre, still used today around the world, is Invisible Theatre, a form of provocative street theatre in which the audience is unaware of the fiction they are witnessing. In this case, actors stage a conflict usually based on the subversion of “normal” behaviour in a public space, designed to provoke involvement and debate among spectators; often plants will also be hidden within the crowd to represent polarized perspectives and incite audience engagement. For the spectator, the fiction is real life; usually the performance will end without revealing otherwise.[23]  In Forum Theatre, the audience is aware of their involvement as protagonists. The play must be designed to depict various aspects of a given issue and culminate in unresolved crisis and the failure of protagonists’ solutions. First, the play is performed as conventional theatre of approximately 10-30 minutes. When the play is run a second time, the audience is invited to shout “stop” at any point and take the place of any character whose struggles they feel they understand. In traditional Forum Theatre, this must only be a character depicted as oppressed, or one seen as struggling; in other versions this is extended to all characters. They must then attempt to alter the course of dramatic action by trying alternative solutions. These changes must not be “magic” – that is to say, they must respect the realistic parameters set by the characters and context. The actors within the scene must improvise responses to these interventions such that each proposed solution is confronted with realistic tensions and responses, and the consequences and drawbacks of each solution are explored live. If an intervention fails, the play continues until another spect-actor stops the play again; if it succeeds, the audience is then invited to replace an oppressor character to find new ways to challenge the oppressed character. In either case, once the consequences of the change are played out, the actors return to the run of the play to allow for further interventions.[24]  All of this is facilitated by the Joker, who explains the rules, corrects errors, encourages interventions, and draws out themes and realizations, all without imposing themselves on the process or dictating the course of events. The Joker or “wild card” leader is best understood as an “exegete” rather than a “custodian of the truth; the Joker’s job is simply to try to ensure that those who know a little more get the chance to explain it, and that those who dare a little, dare a little more and show what they are capable of.”[25]  Decision-Making: Legislative Theatre  This is an optional extension of Forum Theatre, developed by Boal during his tenure as City Councillor of Rio de Janeiro from (1993-96) as a way to integrate the political contributions of Forum Theatre within political decision-making institutions: “by making theatre as politics rather than merely making political theatre.”[26] During Boal’s term in office, 20 laws were passed through this process; it has also been used in Canada and the United Kingdom.  In this process, Forum Theatre is created and performed concerning proposed laws, as a means to directly involve everyday citizens in policy-making. Once the Forum is completed, a Chamber consisting of representatives of the affected community is created where proposals based on spect-actors’ interventions are presented, debated and voted upon akin to official procedure. The recommendations so approved are then collected and presented to lawmakers. Given the nature of the particular process, workshops and projects might run from two hours to two years.[27]  Adaptations  Boal was famous for making clear that “whatever isn’t expressly forbidden, is allowed”; and while the guidelines for Forum Theatre are described in Boal’s work to extraordinary detail, they have been inevitably adapted by various practitioners due to divergent philosophies or agendas.  Theatre for Living (David Diamond): While very similar to Boal’s Theatre of the Oppressed, this was developed out of an acknowledgement that lines between oppressor and oppressed are not so clear as Boal’s dichotomy presumes. Theatre for Living is designed to represent all characters in their complexity and leave room for intervention and exploration of all characters and their potential motivations and possibilities.[28]  Rainbow of Desire: Boal developed this series of techniques later in his career to speak to oppressions to subjectivity and psychic life, after various projects with European communities revealed patterns of internalized oppression. It strives to isolate, analyze and directly confront the multiple “cops in the head” that often dictate human behaviour, perception and esteem.[29] While it can be used in isolation to contend with psychological problems, this method is now used as part of the “arsenal” in the process of making any play.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Forum Theatre has been shown to work successfully across a remarkable range of cultural, political, and social differences and demands. It has been used by peasants and workers, students and teachers, artists, social workers, psychotherapists, and NGOs, among others; in schools, streets, churches, trade-unions, theatres, and prisons.[30]  Forum Theatre and War Areas  Every year since 1997, Ashtar Theatre has been producing a Forum Play that targets the local audiences, especially those in rural areas; women, marginalized groups, and school students in accordance with the topics dealt with at the forum production of that year.[31] The theme of the play of 2002 is the vicious circle of violence that has been observed developing at schools - due to the political, economical and social injustice imposed on the Palestinian people.[32]  Forum Theatre and Prisons  The People’s Palace Projects’ Staging Human Rights/Direitos Humanos em Cena was a six-year project beginning in the State of São Paulo in 2000, and running in four distinct phases through to 2005 when it scaled up to a further 11 Brazilian states, reaching 20,000 prisoners and 1,000 prison guards.[33] The aim was to create effective means to improve the conditions of implementing human rights and citizenship for prisoners and staff of the Prison System in the State of São Paulo. The project culminated in the presentation of three Forums by female and male prisoners and prison guards at the Carandiru Prison. Staging Human Rights included a research programme which gave evidence of an increased consciousness of human rights for a vast majority of the participants.[34]  Legislative Theatre  Headlines Theatre’s “after homelessness...” began in Vancouver, Canada, in the fall of 2009 with a community workshop of 25 participants with lived experience of homelessness, compromised housing, and mental health. After this preliminary phase, 5 cast members selected from the original workshop went into production for a 3-week period, after which the finished piece will be performed to Vancouver and New Westminster community audiences. Recommendations based on the Forum will be recorded and distilled by a Community Scribe into a Community Action Report. Headlines has the written commitment from the Mental Health Commission of Canada and the Greater Vancouver Regional Steering Committee on Homelessness to use the process and the Community Action Report as a part of their research for National and Regional strategies on mental health and homelessness. This is Headlines’ second Legislative Theatre project.[35]  Theatre and Therapy  Since 1985, Serge Saccon (specialised educator) and Jean-Pierre Pichon (psychiatric nurse) gathered a team of professionals in mental health around the idea of “how to use the techniques of Theatre of the Oppressed in child psychiatry”. The group was created to acknowledge two different types of interventions: (i) in the context of schools, with children of all ages and their teachers, aiming at prevention; (ii) in the context of hospitals, with psychotic or autistic children, or with other symptoms, e.g. inhibition, hyperactivity, personality disorders and suspected abuse.[36]  Theatre for Development  Hundreds, if not thousands, of organizations and initiatives have used  theatre as a development tool : for education or advocacy, as therapy, as a participatory tool, or as an exploratory tool in development.[37]  Forum Theatre in Arts-Based Training  Participatory theatre techniques have been used in organizational training workshops, including managerial and leadership training, sensitization, and problem-solving.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Forum Theatre has proved extremely effective for addressing a wide-range of issues. However, there are certain elements that raise a number of questions and criticisms. The first of these is safety: in exploring delicate and contentious issues involving vulnerable communities, while the work is designed to empower and equip participants, it also inevitably brings to the surface hidden feelings, fears and traumatic experiences. In doing so, facilitators must be particularly gifted at creating a safe context in which these raw emotions and experiences might be expressed and explored. Indeed, where Forum Theatre is used to generate public dialogue and community knowledge rather than as explicit therapy, community support such as a social worker or therapist must be available in some way to provide for those individuals left exposed during and after the Forum process.  This touches upon another aspect of Forum: the necessary prevention of a “hit and run” community process. This term is common within ethical discussions of community arts activism, and refers to processes that fail to be accountable and present for the longer-term effects of a singular event. As Forum theatre is usually used to address specific problems within a limited time-frame, it runs the risk of moving on after performances without community follow-up. Here, relationships with the community in question and its various organizations and support systems might be developed and made visible during the Forum event such that community members are aware of available resources.  Linked to both of these risks is the criticism of Invisible Theatre in particular: designed to be provocative and perceived as real to bystanders, Invisible Theatre has sometimes presented at times violent and dangerous scenarios – domestic disputes and potential suicides, for example – which have led at times to emergency services interventions. In London, this has led to a banning of Invisible Theatre on the Underground. The question arises as to the ethical limits and social responsibilities of Invisible Theatre performers; certainly, it begs caution concerning safety for any potential production.

Collaborative governance is relatively new and still emerging as a practice and field of study; there area variety of more precise definitionsthat are contested and overlap in academic debate.  Ansell and Gash (2008) provide six criteria for identifying collaborative governance which are useful in helping distinguish it from other approaches:the process is initiated by a public agency or institution  includes participation of non-state actors  participants are not only to be consulted — they have decision-making power  the forum is a formal process and organised formally  decision making is  consensus -oriented  the focus is related to public policy or public management [2]More recently, Emerson and Nabatchi (2015) have defined collaborative governance as ""the processes and structures of public policy decision making and management that engage people across the boundaries of public agencies, levels of government, and/or the public, private, and civic spheres to carry out a public purpose that could otherwise not be accomplished."" [3]  Collaborative governance is sought when the management of a sector requires more technical, analytical, and/or financial power than is possessed by one party. Collaborative governance is often pursued as a solution to the principal-agent dilemma and the local knowledge problem. The principal-agent problem occurs when one person is responsible for making decisions on behalf of another; this can result in conflicts of interest and legitimacy problems. By including a full range of stakeholders, collaborative arrangements may mitigate this. The local knowledge problem refers to the distribution of specialised knowledge which means that a central decision-making authority does not have access to all the relevant knowledge to make an informed decision. Again, collaborative governance may help meet this challenge by bringing together those with local knowledge and sharing decision-making power.  Beyond this, collaborative governance has an important normative basis. It responds to the failures of top-down policymaking and implementation processes. It also provides an alternative to adversarial and interest group-driven approaches to governing; collaborative governance may follow a more consensus-oriented mode of decision-making [2].However, consensus may not always be achieved in practice.  Collaborative governance may be suitable for tackling different types of policy problems. On the one hand, long-running problems may be easier to solve within a small group of stakeholders. On the other, ‘wicked’ policy problems may find more feasible solutions when addressed by a broader range of perspectives [4].  Origins and Development  Cases of collaboration between public and private actors are not a new phenomena. However, the past two decades have witnessed an increase in collaborations between state and non-state actors and the emergence of collaborative governance as a distinctive approach [2].  Collaborative governance ‘bubbled up from many local experiments, often in reaction to previous governance failures’ [2]. One early example of the somewhat organic development of collaborative governance is described by Ansell (2011). In the 1980s, the Desert Tortoise was unexpectedly listed as an endangered species in the United States, following pressure and a court case from environmental groups. The listing presented a significant challenge since the habitat of the Desert Tortoise was at the site of rapid development and urban expansion in the area around Las Vegas. As an endangered species, any alteration to this habitat would be prohibited and presented significant challenges to developing the area. Local governments and developers initially challenged the ruling in court but lost, and looked for alternative approaches. Eventually a collaborative process emerged involving all the affected stakeholders and agreement was reached between the different parties on developing a  Habitat Conservation Plan . This example points towards a pragmatist approach and ‘shows that even under conditions of bitter social conflict, collaborative governance can lead stakeholders to identify mutual gains’ [5].  Ansell and Gash (2008) suggest a further number of reasons for an increasingly collaborative approach, such as providing an alternative approach to other governance approaches [2]. Managerialism, for example, considers that generic management skills can be used to manage diverse organisations and issues — rather than requiring specific knowledge and skills. It also encompasses an ideology based around the superiority of managers and can exclude the knowledge and expertise of others [7], resulting in a lack of accountability [2]. Collaborative governance has emerged as an alternative, which takes into account all affected stakeholders, sharing decision-making power and responsibility.  Another reason cited for the emergence of collaborative governance is the increasingly complex and interdependent issues and situations that governments are required to deal with. At the same time, knowledge has become more specialised. This creates a greater need for collaboration to adequately deal with such issues in an effective way [2].  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Who participates in a collaborative governance process will largely depend on the issue or problem being addressed. In the case of the Desert Tortoise outlined above, participants included local government, environmentalists, developers and other stakeholders such as landowners. Participants will usually be invited by whoever initiates the collaborative process, usually a public agency, although some stakeholders are likely to already be involved in some way. Having invited participants could leave a process open to a legitimacy deficit if certain groups are excluded. Thus, it is essential to ensure that the full range of relevant stakeholders and interest groups are able to participate [4].  Consideration of who participates is not only important for legitimacy, but can also shape the scope and agenda of a collaborative governance arrangement, given the diversity of perspectives on a given issue. A further consideration for participants are the power dynamics and context in which a collaborative process takes place, which can affect stakeholders’ willingness to participate, how they communicate with each other, and can shape decisions and outcomes [6].  Collaborative governance for the most part will involve organisations and stakeholders rather than the general public, alongside public or government agencies. However, it can involve individual citizens as well as organised groups, as was the case in  Geraldton 2029 and Beyond , a deliberative process in Western Australia that incorporated collaborative governance.  Ansell and Gash (2008) note that public agencies often collaborate with each other, but this is not considered collaborative governance because it must involve all affected stakeholders or interest groups, which will inevitably include outside organisations [2].  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Central to the concept of collaborative governance is the point that all stakeholders have influence over actual decision-making. Collaborative governance is not consultative. The reality of this may vary in practice; a final decision may rest with a public agency but other parties must be directly involved in the decision-making process [2].  The precise activities that take place during a collaborative governance process are highly likely to vary in practice, with no two processes being alike [9]. They may encompass a range of other participatory methods and tools such as  workshops ,  roundtable discussions , different forms of dialogue and decision-making activities, and multiple stages. In addition to this, collaborative governance arrangements are both time and resource intensive, require active management, require trust, commitment and reciprocity from all parties, and can be fragile [9]. Collaborative governance arrangements are likely to be long term, and may in fact demand continuous revision and re-assessment in light of the developing nature of the challenge. This may be the case for forums where stakeholders cannot participate, such as future generations [4].  The Sacramento Water Forum is a collaborative arrangement that provides a more tangible example of the conditions and process that might be present [8], although this should be viewed with the  sui generis  nature of collaborative governance arrangements in mind [9]:Inclusion of a full range of stakeholders  A task that is meaningful to the participants  Participants who established their own ground rules for behavior, agenda setting, making decisions, and many other topics  A process that begins with mutual understanding of interests and avoids positional bargaining  A dialogue where all are heard, respected, and equally able to participate  A self-organizing process that is unconstrained by conveners in its time or content and that permits the status quo and all assumptions to be questioned  Information that is accessible and fully shared among participants  An understanding that  consensus  is reached only when all interests have been explored and every effort has been make to satisfy these concerns [8]Since a single definition of collaborative governance is somewhat slippery to pin down, various practices may be viewed as collaborative governance by some but not by others. For example, Wanna (2008) outlines collaborative relations between different government agencies [9], whereas this would not be considered collaborative governance by Ansell and Gash (2008).  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  The outcomes of collaborative governance arrangements have been documented in a wide range of academic literature. Due to the somewhat nebulous and ‘untidy’ [2] nature of this literature, it is difficult to draw any general conclusions on the influence and outcomes of collaborative governance. In their meta-analysis of collaborative governance, Ansell and Gash (2008) found it was not feasible to find out whether collaborative governance was more effective or had better governance outcomes than adversarial or managerial approaches, as the studies they looked at did not seek to address this question. Instead, numerous studies have sought to understand the conditions in which stakeholders are willing to collaborate and the nature of that collaboration [2].  There are numerous examples of both successes and failures in collaborative governance. An example of the latter is described by Diane Smith (2008) who recounts how a three-year long collaboration in Australia’s Northern Territory between an Aboriginal (Binninj) community and local government was disastrously undermined by an unexpected media release from the Federal government announcing that it would take control of large number of Aboriginal communities and impose a number of control measures. The local government had been unaware of this announcement and it served to undermine several years of collaboration and cooperation. This is further compounded by the historical failures of Australian policy and governance to serve the interests of Indigenous communities, which creates significant challenges for collaboration given the lack of trust and confidence in government [10].  A successful case of collaborative governance is seen in the  Community Planning Framework in place in Scotland . This process involves a plethora of actors including citizens, businesses, local government, and non-profit organisations. This is a complex arrangement involving multiple stages and tiers of decision-making. Whilst the initiative is relatively new, it appears to have had a positive influence over the national government who have increased funding for community planning initiatives and led to the government pursuing more interaction and involvement with small citizen groups.  The examples above give an indication of the diversity of collaborative governance initiatives and the difficulties of drawing singular conclusions regarding their influence and efficacy.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  As discussed above, the breadth and depth of collaborative governance arrangements varies widely. There is a range of academic literature that analyses various aspects of collaborative arrangements which is better placed for a detailed overview. Wanna (2008, p.9-10) provides some useful considerations of advantages and disadvantages, outlined below.AdvantagesCan lead to better policy decisions through the inclusion of a broader range of perspectives, meaning a decision is more likely to be accepted.  Can lead to innovation through opening up policy problems to a wider range of contributions, leading to new ideas.  Allows non-state actors to understand the processes of government better.  Can benefit all parties involved through mutual learning and capacity building.  Can make governments and public agencies more effective at policymaking through sharing responsibility and combining skills and knowledge.DisadvantagesMay be difficult to engage public agencies with the notion of collaborating due to reluctance to cede some control or fear of increased risk.  Blurring accountability: when more parties are involved, who is accountable for decisions becomes more complex. This is exacerbated when things go wrong.  Non-state actors are not bound by the same rules and accountability as public agencies. Governments may seek to censor them; non-state organisations may choose to disrupt processes and are not accountable for final outcomes.  Challenges will arise when parties have different preferences or objectives in mind and there is no common objective.  Collaboration may not always be genuine; as with other participatory processes, it can be used by governments to try and sell a decision that has already been made or to promote the government’s existing position or policy [9]See AlsoEcosystem-based Management Collaborative Design   References  [1]Donahue, J.

 Practical democracy is a theoretical alternative to the current system of American representative democracy. PD involves dividing the electorate into very small groups. The groups would agree which member is the best advocate of the group's concerns. Those so chosen would be arranged in similar groups to continue sifting through the electorate to identify the individuals most motivated and best qualified to address and resolve the people's concerns. The method creates a political infrastructure built on the concerns the people hold in common and on the individuals they agree are best qualified to address and resolve those concerns. [1]Origins and Development 
 Democracy is a contested term. In the United States, ‘democracy’ has come to refer to a process of voting for a candidate nominated by a political party. This is not, according to Fred Gohlke, the true meaning of democracy. In “A New Proposal for a Practical Democracy Built On Public Agreement”, Gohlke argues that, in a truly democratic political process, the entire electorate would participate in defining the issues the government must address and agreeing on the individuals best equipped to resolve those issues. The challenge of democracy is not to divide the people into parties that compete for the power to rule. The challenge is to find the best advocates of the common interest and raise them to positions of leadership. Practical Democracy was developed as a way to meet this challenge when, according to Gohlke’s observations, the realities of life, particularly economic needs, tend to distract the electorate from serious thought about public concerns. [2]  
 The method was designed in reaction to a failing of American democracy. Writing in 2018, Gohlke states that politicians have been incredibly successful in dividing the nation against itself and manipulating a political system in which voting for a party candidate simply confirms the right of a small group of people to control and run the country. A new mechanism of electoral democracy is needed to achieve government by the people; one which can sift through the diversity of people to find those individuals with the qualities needed to address and resolve contemporary public concerns. Practical Democracy is Gohlke’s answer. [3]In developing the method, Gohlke drew inspiration from the scholarship of Martin Gilens and Benjamin I. Page who found evidence for “the nearly total failure of 'median voter' and other Majoritarian Electoral Democracy theories. When the preferences of economic elites and the stands of organized interest groups are controlled for, the preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy.” [4]  Practical Democracy was conceived in response to this perceived deterioration of the American political infrastructure which has, in the estimation of Gilens and Page, threatened the country’s reputation as a democratic society [5]  - a situation which Golhke asserts was foreshadowed by Justice Louis Brandeis statement ""we may have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both.” [6]  
 Gohlke also cites the following quote by John Dewey as an inspiration for Practical Democracy’s conception and design: 
 “The old saying that the cure for the ills of democracy is more democracy is not apt if it means that the evils may be remedied by introducing more machinery of the same kind as that which already exists, or by refining and perfecting that machinery.” [7]It was Gohlke’s hope that Practical Democracy could be a viable alternative to the current democratic system: a political process that gives the people - all the people - an opportunity to participate in the practice of politics and to deliberate among themselves and agree on the issues they want resolved and the individuals they think best able to resolve them. [8]As Gohlke sees it, organized political power and concentrated wealth feed off each other: a relationship epitomized by the current political situation of the United States. A new electoral process was necessary, one which, given the range of public issues and the way each individual's interest in political matters varies over time, examines the entire electorate during each election cycle, seeking the people's best advocates. PD was therefore designed to let every voter influence the outcome of each election to the best of each individual's desire and ability. [9]Practical Democracy was developed to responds to the eight ‘faults’ which Gohlke sees as characteristic of America’s political infrastructure: Democracy is treated like a team sport, dividing the people into confrontational parties provides a base for power-seekers but does not find constructive solutions to common problems 
 Party politics divides the electorate rather than uniting it, disenfranchising non-partisans: the very people who may have the most balanced view of the community's needs 
 Partisan politics can result in government by a small fraction of the people who victimize the public by the most basic and effective strategy of domination - Divide and Conquer 
 Partisanship - when it helps give voice to differing views - can also be of value. While people seek out and align themselves with others who share their views, they hone their views in the process, forming a consensus and giving breadth, depth and volume to their voice. Through partisanship, the common interest is advanced by examining conceivable options. 
 Political party operations are expensive, and thus heavily influenced by money. Political parties ‘sell’ the laws their candidates will enact when elected, allowing the people who finance party operations to draft the laws the people endure – at a cost. 
 Decisions are made through passion rather than intelligent discourse because there is no space for the electorate to examine candidates or discuss matters of public concern. 
 Incumbency has led to the inability for the electorate to select new representatives equipped to resolve contemporary issues. Such a political system – which allows organized groups, and not the people, to decide who can be a candidate for public office – is undemocratic. [10]  Practical Democracy offers a theoretical alternative to modern American democracy, one which supports a democratic political process which: Uses a bottom-up arrangement that lets every member of the community influence political decisions to the full extent of each individual's desire and ability; 
 Enables and encourages the people to deliberate on political issues; 
 Lets the people agree among themselves the issues they want resolved and the people they want to resolve them; 
 Incorporates partisanship without letting partisans control the political process; 
 Eliminates the influence of money on the political process; and 
 Lets the people change their representatives as they deem appropriate. [11]Practical Democracy “springs from the knowledge that some people are better advocates of the public interest than others” – a conclusion Gohlke drew from Jane Mansbridge’s  Beyond Adversary Democracy . [12]  In reference to a small community in Vermont, Mansbridge states that, ""[w]hen interests are similar, citizens do not need equal power to protect their individual interests; they only need to persuade their wisest, cleverest, most virtuous, and most experienced citizens to spend their time solving town problems in the best interests of everyone."" [13]According to Mansbridge, the fundamental challenge of democracy, is to find those ""wisest, cleverest, most virtuous, and most experienced citizens"" and empower them as our representatives. [14]  Gohlke designed PD to accomplish this by giving every member of the electorate the right to be a candidate and the ability to influence the selection process, while ensuring that no individual or group has an advantage over others. [15]Participant Recruitment and Selection 
 The theoretical construction of Practical Democracy uses a bottom-up arrangement that lets every member of the community influence political decisions to the full extent of each individual's desire and ability. It thus requires people to be actively invited to participate in the political process. According to Gohlke, this can be accomplished if, before an election, the Mayor of a town writes to each voter and the media will help mobilize the electorate by reporting on the process. [16]  
 In the process of Practical Democracy, the electorate would be divided into groups of three, or ‘triads.’ How the triads select a member to advance to the next ‘level’ in the process depends on many variables, including the makeup of the group.  Random selection  of triad members will produce innumerable arrangements of gender, religion, race, and political persuasion. In addition, the participants may be people of unequal financial resources, unequal intellectual capacity, unequal dress habits, and a multitude of other human differences, any or all of which may affect the way members of the group relate to each other. [17]When designing the process, Gohlke concluded that, if a triad advances one of its members, the members would have agreed on the issues that most concern them and the person best able to address and resolve those issues. Citing Mansbridge, Gohlke states that, given the abundance and diversity of public issues and the difficulty of achieving perfect agreement, it is likely the triads will advance people whose ‘internal gyroscopes’ are in line with their peers'. [18]When those chosen meet at the next level, they would discuss their concerns as well as those brought up by their new triad-mates. In the course of the discussions, some issues would be judged to have greater effect on the community than others. According to Gohlke, the important thing throughout the process is not what issues the triads discuss, it is that individuals advance because their peers agree with them. The result would be a political system built on agreement rather than confrontation. [19]How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making 
 The process of Practical Democracy provides a theoretical model with which to accomplish the sorting and selecting mechanism required to implement Jane Mansbridge's ""Selection Model"" of Political Representation. The process is designed to yield self-motivated representatives whose gyroscopes are aligned with the objectives of the people who select them, and letting the people advance the individuals they agree have the qualities necessary to resolve public issues into ever-more deliberative groups to work out solutions from broadly differing perspectives. [20]PD focuses on selecting representatives who will resolve adversarial encounters to the advantage of the commonweal. During the process, participants would consider both common and conflicting interests, and, because PD is bidirectional, it gives advocates of conflicting interests a continuing voice. At the same time, it encourages the absorption of diverse interests, reducing them to their essential element: their effect on the participants in the electoral process. There are no platforms, there is no ideology. The only question is, which participants are the most attuned to the needs of their peers and have the qualities required to advocate the common good. [21]Practical Democracy, as proposed and designed by Gohlke, involves the following steps: 
 Step 1 
 Divide the entire electorate into groups of three randomly chosen people. 
 a) The random grouping mechanism must insure that no two people are assigned to a triad if they served together in a triad in any of the five most recent elections. At the initial level, it must ensure that no two people are assigned to a triad if they are members of the same family. 
 b) At any time up to one week before the process begins, people may declare themselves members of any interest group, faction, party, or enclave, and may create a new one, simply by declaring membership in it. People that do not declare group membership are automatically assigned to a set of people with no affiliation. Triads will be created from members of the same interest group, as long as more than two members of the group exist. When a group has less than three members, the group's remaining candidates are merged with the largest set extant. 
 c) For the convenience of the electorate, triad assignments shall be based on geographic proximity to the maximum extent practical, subject to the foregoing conditions. 
 Step 2 
 Assign a date and time by which each triad must agree that one of the three members is the best advocate of the group's interests. 
 a) Selections will be made by consensus. 
 b) If a triad is unable to agree on a representative in the specified time, all three participants shall be deemed disinclined to participate in the process. 
 Step 3 
 Divide the participants so selected into new triads. 
 Step 4 
 Repeat from step 2 until a target number of selections is reached. 
 For convenience, each iteration is referred to as a 'Level', such that Level 1 is the initial grouping of the entire electorate, Level 2 is the grouping of the selections made at Level 1, and so forth. The entire electorate participates at level 1 giving everyone an equal opportunity to advance to succeeding levels. 
 Elective and Appointive Offices 
 The final phase of the Practical Democracy (PD) process, electing candidates to specific public offices, is omitted from this outline because that task is implementation-dependent. Whatever method is used, it is recommended that participants who reach the highest levels but do not achieve public office become a pool of validated candidates from which appointive offices must be filled. 
 Simplified Illustration 
 This table illustrates the process for a community of 25,000 voters. For simplicity, it omits interest group considerations and assumes each triad selects a candidate. The process is shown through 7 levels. Those who implement the process will determine the number of levels necessary for their specific application. 1) If the number of candidates does not divide equally into triads, any candidates remaining are overflow. Level 1 is a special case. When there is overflow at Level 1, the extra person(s) automatically become candidates at Level 2. Thereafter, when there is overflow at any level, the number of people needed to create a full triad are selected at random from the people who were not selected at the previous level. 
 2) To avoid patronage, appointive offices, including cabinet positions, must be filled using candidates that reached the final levels but were not selected to fill elective offices. 
 Time Lapse Example 
 To give a very rough idea of the time lapse required for such an election, we will hypothesize triad lives of 5 days for each level. To illustrate, triads begin on a Wednesday and report their selection on a Monday. In a 7-level election (like the one shown above), the process would complete in 49 days: Cost And Time Consumption 
 In Gohlke’s estimation, the cost of conducting an election using the PD method would be free to the participants, except for the value of their time, and minimal to the government. [22]  The length of time taken to complete an election is much shorter than the time required by campaign-based partisan systems. Even in California, with a voting-eligible population of about 22,000,000, the process would complete in about 12 levels, 145 calendar days. 
 Gohlke designed the process to be shorter than the current campaign-based electoral system and, therefore, potentially more appealing to “those not motivated to seek public office.” As each level completes, two-thirds of the participants can resume their daily lives without further electoral obligation while retaining the ability to guide or instruct their representatives to the extent and in the manner provided by those who implement the process. [23]  
 Influence, Outcomes, and Effects 
 Practical Democracy is a theoretical process and has never been implemented. However, its developer, Fred Gohlke, outlines the following in respect to the method’s potential to effect change and allow current political systems to achieve a more democratic ideal: 
 Practical Democracy offers an electoral process through which the people could actively participate in the conduct of, and impress their moral sense on, their government. If adopted, it would create a unique merger of self-interest and the public interest. It would also complete more quickly and with less public distraction than existing systems, however large the electorate. PD is both a bottom-up process – giving every member of the community the opportunity to participate to the full extent of each individual's desire and ability – and one which ensures that the people who advance to positions of political leadership are examined, carefully and repeatedly, before their peers agree to advance them. [24]The PD process as outlined offers an alternative way to find the individuals with the qualities needed to address and resolve contemporary public concerns. It would give participants time for deliberation, an opportunity to understand the rationale for the positions of others, and a platform on which to discuss substantive matters – with a purpose. [25]  
 In theory, Practical Democracy would correct the flaws Gohlke observed in the present American system of governance by: Eliminating money from politics; 
 Incorporating partisanship without letting partisans control the process; 
 Completing more quickly than our present system; 
 Functioning without political campaigns or the marketing of candidates; 
 Enabling and encouraging dialogue and deliberation on political issues among the electorate; 
 Letting the people change their representatives as they see fit; 
 Using a bottom-up arrangement that lets every member of the community influence political decisions to the full extent of each individual's desire and ability; 
 Ensuring that candidates for public office are examined carefully before they are elected; and 
 Building on agreement by the members of the electorate rather than on confrontation. [26]Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 Practical Democracy has never been implemented in reality, but Fred Gohlke asserts that the concept is more democratic than many political systems in the Western world. In theory, it would let the people, themselves, agree on the issues they want addressed and the individuals best suited to address them. It replaces divisive politics with political leadership based on agreement. [27]PD in practice would not alter the structure of government, but simply change the way representatives are selected. While the current American political system does contain venues for resolving adversarial issues in the legislatures and councils, the solutions that flow from those assemblies cannot be better than the people who craft them. PD lets the electorate agree on the individuals they believe will resolve those adversarial issues in the public interest. [28]Peoples' interests change over time so should be given voice and reflected in the results of each election. The PD process would allow particular interests to attract supporters to their cause and elevate their most effective advocates during each electoral cycle. Advocates of those interests could proclaim their ideas and encourage discussion of their concepts. Some would be accepted, in whole or in part, as they are shown to be in the common interest of the community.  [29]In theory, PD responds to one of modern democracy’s most pressing dilemmas: finding those individuals whose self-interest encourages them to seek advancement and whose commitment to the public interest makes them acceptable to their peers. Such persons cannot be identified by partisan groups seeking to advance their own interests. They can only be identified by agreement among the people themselves. [30]Possible Implementation or Adoption 
 According to Gohlke, the best chance for something like the Practical Democracy concept to develop will be if it is adopted in a small community where the people want to improve their government. There are considerable efforts, particularly in Europe, to eliminate the evils of party politics. In May of 2015, the people of Frome in the U.K. rejected all party candidates and elected an independent city government. [31]  In Gohlke’s estimation, this rejection showed that the party system is vulnerable. The weakness is that candidates for public office are selected by a group of Independents rather than by the people themselves. Practical Democracy would correct that flaw by letting the people participate in the selection process to the full extent of each individual's desire and ability. [32]Practical Democracy’s adoption is stymied by the fact that, according to Gohlke, true democracy has no champions, offers no rewards for individuals or vested interests, and gives no individual or group an advantage over others. Hence, it offers no incentive for power-seeking individuals or groups to advocate its adoption.

It is described as an ""empowering process [which] can achieve desirable quantitative and qualitative [community development] outcomes"". [1]  Community audits can be performed on various levels — from organization to neighbourhood to city. What is important is that the audit is inclusive of those in need of provisions.  Community auditing developed as a participatory research method. The need came from the fact that increasingly, research is required into the needs of various communities in order to secure effective services. However, traditional research methods are not always appropriate or helpful, such as for young people and vulnerable or isolated communities.  Community auditing was developed at Manchester Metropolitan University  to address this need.  Community auditing supports and trains members of the community, such as youth workers, to conduct participatory audits. The process not only identifies the needs of the community but raises community awareness of resources, and develops participants skills and knowledge of the relevant issues affecting them. [2]  Origins and Development  Auditing is traditionally a method of evaluating most commonly associated with accounting; it is used to make an official record or account for a set of resources or assets. Community auditing departs from this account in that it aims to place the community's voices at the heart of the auditing process. It was developed as a method for youth and community workers to use and its principles are in congruence with principles and aims of community and youth work such as fostering conversation, informal education, and challenging oppression. [2]  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Participant constituencies will vary according to need. The most important point is that the audit is carried out by, and for, those affected. The 'community' is self-identified. [2]  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The audit is typically led by a trusted member of the community who is specially trained to facilitate the process. However, the aim of this person is supportive rather than directive, and the audit should develop a sense of ownership by the community. A range of research methods may be used but are chosen by the community, as is the agenda.  Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsKnow what outcomes and effects this method typically has? Help uscomplete this section! Analysis and Lessons Learned  Some of the challenges arising from using this approach include the time and effort required, as it is typically a slow process that demands patience and resources. It may also be a challenge for the worker leading the audit, given that they must not take over or manage the process, which can lead to frustration. Community members may have had negative experiences with researchers in the past and be reluctant to participate. Some communities or community members may also struggle to keep up participation throughout the process; Packham cites drug users as a group with erratic lifestyles as an example of this. [2] Overcoming these challenges involves effective training and support for workers or agencies conducting community audits, as well as anticipation and planning for possible obstacles.

154,method,Civic Lottery,https://participedia.net/method/154,Civic lottery is a lottery-based tool for randomly selecting citizens to participate in democratic initiatives or even in public office in order to obtain a representative sample.,0,2010-02-23,2024-01-18,60,Crazzarc,https://participedia.net/user/60,425982,"""Deborah W.A. Foulkes""",https://participedia.net/user/425982,en,0,,,,stratified,not,,,,,,,,national, multinational, city/town,,,,,,,,,,,," Problems and Purpose  Civic lottery refers to the contemporary use of  sortition  or allotment: a lottery-based selection technique used to draw a fair, representative sample of citizens for invitation or inclusion in anything from participatory events to public office. It is based on the premise that all citizens in a democracy have an equal right to serve their society by participating in its governance. By using the civic lottery, participation is determined by 'lot' rather than money, partisan affiliation, or political connection. [1]  The civic lottery is a technique used by practitioners and scholars to draw a fair, demographically representative sample of citizens for inclusion in any form of participatory event. According to consultation firm  MASS LBP , the civic lottery is an effective way ofFor example, organisers of a  Citizens' Jury  may employ the civic lottery technique to select a panel of jurists.  Origins and Development  Civic lottery is not a new concept - it is popularly known to many Anglo-Saxon judicial systems as jury duty where citizen juries are summoned to hear and render verdicts in court cases.  The use of civic lottery to select participant for deliberative democratic events such as citizens' juries has been popularlized in recent decades by the Canadian firm MASS LBP. In a 2018 report, MASS states that they have used the lottery mechanism to select participants for the majority of their deliberative decision-making events called 'reference panels'. Since the early 2000s, MASS has identified and invited over 300,000 Canadian citizens through the civic lottery, of which nearly 2,000 have taken part in a participatory process.[1]  How it Works  Participants selected through civic lottery are commonly drawn from an official government registry of persons with permanent residence or citizenship. Letters are sent to a large number of people with the expectation that many will not be able to participate due to scheduling conflicts or other disqualifying factors.  Panel members are randomly selected from among the pool of candidate-respondents to create a panel that roughly matches the demographic profile of the wider population.  MASS LBP, a Canadian company inspired by the work of the  Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform (Ontario)  has developed an increasingly sophisticated system for running civic lotteries to randomly select citizens to participate on government advisory panels. The lotteries, which ask citizens to give up several consecutive weekends to participate on a panel, enjoy a strong positive response rate, typically exceeding five percent. [1]  The procedure for using the civic lottery is as follows:  Organisers first decide on the population they should target for their event, the number of desired participants, the demographic breakdown of the wider population, and what method they will use for distributing invitations. Lots are then drawn and invitations are sent to 'winners'. In the majority of cases, invitations take the form of a letter and are sent by mail, however, any method of delivery is acceptable so long as it ""give everyone in the population roughly the same chance of being invited to volunteer."" [1] The invitations sent by MASS LBP offer a reproduceable template:  ""The invitation explains that the recipient is being asked to volunteer to help the convenor solve a problem that affects the population, and that, if selected, they will be working with others on behalf of the whole population to develop solutions.  Those who volunteer are asked to provide basic demographic information required for the lottery process, but are not asked to make a case for why they should be selected — as long as they meet the basic eligibility criteria, they are placed into the pool of volunteers."" [1]  A second civic lottery is then performed to select a group of participants from the pool of volunteers. This second drawing of lots is done in such a way that they final group of individuals matches the demographic criteria decided by organisers (eg. an even gender balance).Use ExamplesCivic lotteries are increasingly popular in Canada, where provincial Citizens' Assemblies on Electoral Reform took place in  British Columbia in 2004  and in  Ontario in 2006 . The membership of each Assembly was determined by a civic lottery which invited citizens to volunteer as candidates. In British Columbia, the government sent 23,034 letters to randomly identified citizens throughout the province. 1,715 replied and volunteered to serve as members of the Assembly. In Ontario, 123,489 citizens were identified during a random electronic draw from the Permanent Register of Electors. Each citizen received a letter inviting him or her to apply and 7,033 volunteered as candidates. Ultimately, during a final selection process 158 names were drawn from among the candidates to participate as members of the BC Assembly. 103 were selected as members in Ontario.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Civic lottery is a popular method of selection especially in countries which have or allow access to official citizen registries since a random sample can be extracted and the final selection can be made to reflect wider demographics. In this way, the method is ideal for participatory initiatives deciding on a contentious issue since the panel of participants are unlikely to be biased one way or another.  The efficacy of civic lottery is evidenced by its widespread use in a number of contexts. Its ability to produce an unbiased jury increases the legitimacy of the subsequent deliberative event.

The jury are usually given a specific question to answer or a clearly defined scope, and provide a report at the end of the process detailing their recommendations.  [1]The purpose of a Citizens’ Jury is to bring  deliberation  and public participation into public policy decisions. A CJ is a small enough group to help ensure genuine and effective deliberation can take place, and utilises a random or stratified sample of the community to try and ensure that the group is sufficiently diverse and representative of the broader affected public. [2]  Proponents of the CJ model suggest that decisions made by a representative group of citizens are more likely to be accepted and viewed as legitimate by the broader public, because the jury making the recommendation are everyday citizens as well.  [3]Citizens’ Juries are usually used in an advisory capacity, tasked with producing a collective recommendation or verdict.  [4]In many cases, decision makers may give some prior commitment as to how they might respond to recommendations from a jury. For example, in South Australia the state government usually commits to presenting all jury recommendations directly to parliament.  [5]In some cases, the decision-making authority will agree in advance to accepting and implementing the jury’s recommendations.  [6]Citizens’ Juries can be used to address a wide range of problems and policy issues. CJs are deliberative processes, which emphasise the importance of deliberation and making collective decisions. Inherent to these processes is the provision of a range of perspectives and information, so that jurors can be fully informed and base their deliberations on solid reasoning. Therefore, CJs are particularly suitable for addressing complex issues such as health policy where deeper understanding is required. [7]  They can also be useful for addressing controversial issues or where evidence is contested because the jury will hear from a full range of perspectives rather than receive a one-sided view of the debate. [8]  CJs may also be used when the public is distanced from a decision-making process or there is a (perceived or actual) lack of transparency and democracy associated with an issue, with the hope that bringing citizens into the process may also enhance trust or legitimacy. [9]Citizens’ Juries are often deployed alongside other consultative processes, or as one component of a broader participatory processes. In Australia, it has been used as  part of participatory budgeting processes, where the jury decides how a city or local council’s budget should be spent . Two Citizens’ Juries were held in South Australia alongside a statewide  public engagement and consultation program on nuclear fuel storage . The first jury had an agenda-setting remit, helping to decide the key issues for the broader engagement and the second jury to deliberate upon. In the U.S., CJs are used to evaluate ballot initiatives as part of the  Citizens’ Initiative Review .Origins and DevelopmentThe Citizens’ Jury model came into use in the 1970s. It was introduced in the United States by Ned Crosby of theJefferson Center  , and in Germany by Peter Dienel of the Research Institute for Citizen Participation at the University of Wuppertal.  [10,11]Its founder, Ned Crosby, developed the model and it was first used in 1974 on the issue of healthcare.  [12]  Around 1/3 of the 30+ Citizens' Juries held by the Jefferson Center have been held outside its home state of Minnesota. Issues have included education, low-income housing, welfare reforms, climate change and physician-assisted suicide, as well as locally-relevant issues such as traffic congestion and agricultural practices.  [13]The CJ model was used to evaluate Presidential candidates in the 1976 U.S. election for the first time.  [14]The Jefferson Center pursued this theme into the 1990s, experimenting with use of the Citizens' Jury method for evaluating candidates in upcoming elections including examining the major candidates in the gubernatorial race in Minnesota in 1990 and a U.S. Senate race in Pennsylvania in 1992.  [15]This application of the method did not involve an evaluation of the candidates per se, but asked jurors to evaluate their stances on various issues. In doing so, this application received a positive response in the media, with the juries stimulating public debate.  [16]However, in 1993 the Internal Revenue Service ruled that this activity was inappropriate for a nonprofit organization, and threatened to remove the Center’s tax-deductible status.  [17]As a result, the Jefferson Center agreed to stop using the Citizens' Jury method in this manner.  [18]In recent years, with early help from the Jefferson Center, the Citizens Jury method has been successfully used by a pair of independent organizations -Healthy Democracy Oregonand theHealthy Democracy Fund- to evaluate statewide ballot initiatives; this adaptation of the method is called aCitizens' Initiative Review  . In this process, a CJ is used to evaluate proposed ballot measures.  [19]The judgement of the jury provides a reasoned viewpoint on the measure that is useful for informing the broader public and for informing public officials of citizens’ views.Beyond the Jefferson Center and the U.S., the Citizens’ Jury method has been adapted for use in Australia, the U.K., and Germany on issues such as health policy, transport and infrastructure, planning issues and local governance.Participant Selection and RecruitmentParticipant numbers in a Citizens’ Jury usually range from 12-25 people. [20]  The small size is important for the quality of deliberation as it creates an environment “where stable expectations and relations of trust can be fostered between participants, so essential for mutual understanding.” [21]  However, a number of more recent cases have involved much larger numbers of participants. The  first citizens’ jury in South Australia  was held in 2013 and involved 43 jurors while a  second engagement in 2016  had 54. Also in 2016, a 100-member CJ was  convened in Victoria, Australia . [22]  As of the year 2000, the largest citizens’ jury on record was held in Germany and included 500 citizens from all over the country. [23]  Whilst the larger number of participants can help enhance perceived legitimacy of the process, it carries with it additional logistical and deliberative challenges. [24]Central to the model is the use of a randomly selected group of citizens who are representative of the wider community in question. The aim of this is manifold. Firstly, like other deliberative mini-publics, Citizens Juries aim to recreate a microcosm of the public, literally a ‘mini-populus’ as originally described by Robert Dahl. [25]  Secondly, a random sample of everyday people is preferable to the ‘usual suspects’ that governments usually hear from. These include individuals with a strong political agenda or material stake in the process -- such as industry or interest groups -- who tend to have greater resources and access to policy influencers, generally allowing their voices to be heard above those of the everyday citizen. As the non-profit  newDemocracy Foundation  puts it, “[g]overnments inevitably hear from the noisiest voices who insist on being heard.” [26]  Random selection aims to provide a counter to that by selecting a group of randomly selected citizens. The jury should also be ideally representative of the broader community to ensure diversity and enhance the legitimacy of the jury. Participants should act in their capacity as citizens, rather than as representatives of others/interest groups or as experts. [27]  The use of random selection and its accompanying claims are not without criticism; this is discussed in the final section of this entry.  Jury participants are recruited through various mechanisms. In Australia, organisers typically use a database from Australia Post to generate a sample of potential participants who are invited by post. [28]  Out of those who respond positively, the final sample is stratified. [29]  Communication with participants is then carried out by telephone with organisers on a regular basis prior to the event, to answer any questions and try to ensure attendance on the day. Census data is used to match the necessary demographics of the area. [30]  Other recruitment methods might involve random dialing and using a market research company. [31]  Participants are often offered some kind of compensation or stipend for their time. This can provide an additional incentive for participants who might not usually participate, or whose circumstances could prevent them being able to take part. The use of incentives can be “crucial for successful recruitment and inclusive participation.” [32]Aside from the lay participants, Citizens’ Juries will involve a range of  experts  and stakeholders recruited to present information and evidence to the jury for their consideration. [33]  For the most part, witnesses are selected and recruited by the organisers, although in recent years some juries enable jurors to identify perspectives and witnesses they want to hear from during the process. [34]  Having a range of experts presenting different viewpoints and aspects of an issue is crucial to the success of the jury, because jurors rely on the information provided - skewed information can prejudice the outcome. [35]How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-MakingAlthough the original Jefferson Center Citizens’ Jury model has been altered and adapted as it applied in different settings and on different issues,  [36]there remain some central elements, described below. The original model proscribes the process as typically lasting 5 days,  [37]but many Juries have been convened that are much shorter than this, sometimes less than one day.  [38]This can have a negative impact on the quality of deliberation and recommendations, given the time often needed to process information, deliberate and produce recommendations.  [39]Juries usually take place on the weekend or over a series of weekends, sometimes spanning months depending on the process.[40]Prior to the first meeting: question, remit and planningThe process usually begins with a decision-maker deciding to convene a Citizens’ Jury in the first place.  [41]It is rare for Citizens’ Juries to be instigated by civil society. Some processes are initiated as part of academic research projects or by nonstate actors, such as theCitizens’ Juries on wind farm development in Scotlandor more recently, thePeople’s Policyin South Australia, an adaptation of the CJ method where the public decide on an issue and develop meaningful public policy. For the most part however, a topic is decided on in advance by the government or authority. The precise question and scope delivered to the jury can vary widely, but it must be clearly and carefully worded so that it is easily understandable and neutrally presented.  [42]Prior to the jury meeting, the authority will usually give some sort of prior commitment regarding their response to the jury recommendations. As Citizens’ Juries are for the most used in an advisory capacity only, this prior commitment is essential so that jurors know what kind of impact their recommendations will have and that their effort is worthwhile.  [43]Following the development of an issue and question for the jury, the authority who convene the jury should have little to no involvement in the actual organisation of the process.  [44]This is essential to ensure that the process is independent from the decision-making authority. Therefore, a professional practitioner organisation is sought to organise and deliver the jury. In Australia, a variety of organisations - such asnewDemocracy FoundationandDemocracyCo- offer this service which often includes participant recruitment, selection of witnesses, logistical arrangements and facilitation. There are also independent consultants working as professional facilitators who may be recruited by the organisation to ensure further independence.  [45]Professional facilitators are essential to the success of Citizens’ Juries, helping to ensure quality deliberation where all participants’ contributions are included, supporting participants, and maintaining the structure of the process.  [46]Information PhaseThe first day the jury meets is dedicated to understanding what is to come, receive a brief overview of the issue, and get comfortable with each other so they feel at ease and relaxed throughout the process.  [47]The first main phase of the Jury meeting is comprised of information provision.  [48]Prior to meeting, jurors will usually have been provided with an information pack with background material on the topic. During the first meeting/s, jurors will hear from expert witnesses on the topic at hand and develop a deeper understanding of the various complexities.  [49]Information provision can happen in a variety of ways. One of the most common practices is for jurors to hearpresentations by experts and be able to question them  , or formulate questions together in small groups.  [50]Other formats include expert panels,speed dialogueand strategic questioning.  [51]The aim of the information phase is to provide jurors with as full a range of information, evidence and perspectives as possible.Witnesses may include ‘neutral’ experts who provide background information on the topic, or present technical information.  [52]These witnesses can also be helpful when the topic is highly contested or evidence is conflictual.  [53]Other witnesses may be stakeholders or those presenting a particular viewpoint on the issue, who should provide reasoning for that viewpoint. During the information phase, jurors should be supported by facilitators to critique and question the evidence presented.  [54]Usually, participants are on the receiving end of a large amount of information, often complex or technical, in a short amount of time. This can be confusing, especially if conflicting evidence is presented.  [55]To help participants with this, some juries will include activities towards the start of the process focused on critical thinking skills and working together as a group.  [56]Deliberation PhaseDeliberationis at the heart of the Citizens’ Jury model. During the deliberation phase, jurors will discuss in-depth the evidence they have heard and work towards developing a set of recommendations or making a collective decision, depending on their remit. Deliberation may take place in small groups (especially if the jury is larger) or all together, or both.[57]Practitioners and facilitators make use of a wide range of tools and techniques that can enhance deliberation and support jurors throughout deliberation. These include activities such asidea boxes  ,focused conversation  ,station roundsandsix thinking hats  .During the deliberation phase, it may also be necessary to narrow the number of recommendations or issues under consideration.  [58]This may be done through a process ofconsensus  , or by incorporating different voting methods such asdotmocracy  .Decisions and RecommendationsFinal decisions are made collectively, again either through consensus or through some form of voting after the deliberations.  [59]The majority needed for a recommendation to pass may vary; many processes require a supermajority (generally, 70%+), such as with theGeelong citizens’ juryin Australia.  [60]Some juries also including dissenting voices and minority reports in the final presentation to decision-makers.  [61]For example, the CJ of 350 in South Australia presented their final report onnuclear fuelstorage with a majority report (with ⅔ of the group opposed to the fuel storage facility completely) and a minority report representing the views of the remaining ⅓ who wanted the discussion on fuel storage to continue further.A Jury will usually produce a final report detailing their recommendations. The report may be drafted by participants collaboratively on the final day of the jury, or written by a smaller group who volunteer to write it. The final draft is then presented to decision makers, often by jurors themselves, for consideration.Public InteractionSome Citizens’ Juries allow members of the public or observers to sit in on all or parts of the process. Observers might include academics, interested citizens or interested groups and stakeholders. Observers taking part in this capacity are usually advised that they are not to interrupt or disturb the jurors’ deliberations or attempt to prejudice the process in any way.As Citizens’ Juries are often one component of a broader engagement process, public interaction can occur in a number of ways. In South Australia, CJs are usually used alongside other forms of consultation including surveys, social media and dedicated online forums such as YourSay. This can enable the jury to engage with the views of the wider community, as was the case in the CJ on sharing the roads safely.The next 3 or 4 days is dedicated to hearings that include the expert witnesses. There is time allotted for the jurors to ask question of the witnesses and also time for them to deliberate. After all the hearings have been completed the rest of the time is set aside for the jurors to have final deliberations about the issue as well as answer the crucial charge question or questions.On the final day there is a public forum held where the jurors present their findings and recommendation. There is also an initial report that is issued that is written by the jurors themselves in a language that they created. About two to three weeks later there is a final report issued that is available to the public.The final stage to this process includes an evaluation that is filled out by the jurors. The jurors are asked to evaluate the process itself, the staff, and if they believed the process was biased or not. There is a portion for the jurors to add a personal statement, which is another way they can express their opinions. This evaluation is added into the final report that is made available to the public.Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsCitizens’ juries are not usually given a legal mandate to make binding government or policy decisions although their recommendations can be taken up by governing officials and used to inform legislation. Despite being in use for nearly 30 years, the citizen jury process as run by the Jefferson Center had gained little traction among officials by 2002. The organization “saw it was fighting an uphill battle and cut back on the attempt to conduct Citizens Juries unless they were likely to have more impact on the political system.” [62]  However, the method became more influential in 2008 when it was adapted for using during Oregon’s new Citizen Initiative Review process. Since then, other citizens’ juries both in the United States and elsewhere, have seen their recommendations taken up by policy makers. [63]Beyond policy influence, citizens’ juries have a variety of other outcomes and effects on participants, government officials, and members of the public. According to the GovLab at NYU the following outcomes have been observed when using the citizens’ jury model of mini-public deliberation: [64]Increased accountability by involving the public in advising on or reviewing decisions and actions;  Creation of an “audience effect”, openness, and transparency, which improves accountability and also provides an opportunity for outside insights and input;  Including community members in a participatory process where members of the public are traditionally left out of or distanced from the decision-making process; [65]Improves representation by engaging a “cross-section of the community;"" [66]Is useful in “moderat[ing] divergence” on issues and increasing transparency of process; [67]Provide “jurors” (i.e. community members) an opportunity to build and deepen learnings on specific ICANN issues, and to do so collaboratively; [68]Monitor or gauge community and public sentiment regarding ICANN’s work and its execution of commitments in the public interest; [69]Broker conflict or provide “a transparent and non-aligned viewpoint.” [70]Analysis and Lessons LearnedParticipant AnalysisAnalysis based on juror experience is often collected through satisfaction surveys or some other feedback mechanism at the end of the process. These evaluations are generally available to the public in the final report or in a separate, evaluative publication.In their research on citizens’ juries in Scotland, Roberts and Escobar found that participation in a citizens’ jury was correlated to increased support for the mini-public process.  [71]While they did not study the effects or opinions of non-participants, their research suggests that support for mini-publics increases parallel to their use by governments or other decision-making bodies. According to the authors, “after experiencing the process, 93% of participants thought that citizens are able to make decisions on complex issues. Participants highlighted three necessary conditions for their trust in the process: diversity of views, quality of evidence and effective facilitation.”  [72]Academic AnalysisCitizens’ Juries have also been evaluated by academic scholars. In a review of the design and evaluation of public consultation processes, researchers at McMaster University’s Centre for Health Economics and Analysis identify the following strengths, weaknesses with the citizens’ jury model and recommendations for its use:Strengthscreates informed, active, engaged citizenrypromotes “common good” as a societal objectivepromotes self-transformation and developmentprovides opportunities to introduce new perspectives and challenge existing onesmore careful examination of the issuepromotes consensus buildingpromotes communication between government and governedbrings legitimacy and democratic control to non-elected public bodiesWeaknessesno formal powers; lack of binding decision accountability to act upon decision/recommendationexclusive - only a few individuals participateresource intensive time commitment for participants and organizerspotential problems lie in initial stages of preparation (i.e. jury selection, agenda setting, witness selection) - these have to do with representation (who participates?); responsiveness (what is the jury asked to do); and information transfer (how is the jury informed?)Recommendationssponsoring organization should be clear about what issues it wants to address, how much it can spend on process, and whether it can follow through on the adviceshould be designed for the public and not for special interest groupsbetter with value questions than technical questionsbetter for focused questions about concrete issues, than on large scale issues and should be part of a wider public involvement strategythe development of the agenda should be overseen by an advisory board made up of key stakeholders.

 The model of participatory consensus conference often known as “the Danish model” and/or “citizens’ panel,” is a way to deliberate on policy issues with high technical content using a combination of lay citizens and experts. The participatory consensus conference functions similar to a jury, but deliberates with lay citizens and experts on technical problems.Participatory consensus conference refers to the method developed by the Danish Board of Technology (DBT) after an assessment of US Office of Technology Assessment (OTA)'s model of  consensus conferences . Compared to the OTA 's model, DBT's participatory consensus conferences include the lay people’s opinions, arguments, concerns and reasons in regards to different issues of societal relevance. This also can include allowing the influence of lay perspectives in regulation and political decision making.[2] 
 The central goals of the participatory consensus conference are to improve decision making about science and technology by expanding perspectives; to increase the public's understanding of science and technology through public debate; and to enhance democracy by creating civic engagement.[1] 
 Origins and Development 
 The consensus conference was developed in the 1980s by The Danish Board of Technology (DBT), an independent institution established by the Danish Parliament (3). Shortly after in 1987, the first consensus conference was organized with the focus on “Gene technology in industry and agriculture” (2). Throughout the last ten years, the Danish Broad of Technology has accomplished 15 successful consensus conferences. They were able to enable successful conferences by ensuring the topic was of current interest, requiring expert knowledge,and incorporating conflicts issues that were relevant to the questions developed by the panel. The participatory consensus conference has now crossed boundaries from Europe in to the United States. In April of 1997, the first consensus conference was held in the United States covering ‘telecommunications and the future of Democracy’ (1). 
 Participant Recruitment and Selection 
 A crucial beginning factor in creating an effective consensus conference is establishing the citizen panel. The Danish Board of Technology (DBT) recruits participants by sending an informational invitation to a random telephone sample of 2000 lay citizens. In order for the applicant to participate in the consensus conference, they must send a letter to the DBT with a combination of information about themselves and their motives in order to participate in the panel. The DBT then chooses around 120 to 150 applicants with varied backgrounds regarding age, gender, occupation, education and geographical location. The final panel consists of 14 people along with experts and an advisory/planning committee.How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making 
 The panel becomes the functional elements of the consensus conference by acting similar to a jury. The panel consists of a committee who structures the process, along with the experts, who advise the panelists, and the staff members, who support the process. The citizen panel conducts a combination of questions between two weekends to be taken up with the experts at the conference. The experts must be open minded as well as good communicators. Their role includes thoroughly answering the questions of the panelist along with deliberating among each other for the best possible answer. (3) 
 There are two moderators, also known as the facilitator in a consensus conference whom are required to attend both the preparatory weekend and the final conference itself. The moderators must be professional and have experience in participatory processes. At the same time, the moderators will facilitate a fair dialogue among the lay panel participants and ensure substantial information that is transferred from the experts. A key factor in participating as the moderator for a consensus conference is credibility, relevance to the topic itself and neutrality. The moderator must fully understand the procedure itself while being able to stay objective to a given topic. This will both require encouragement and making sure the panel clearly understands different views and/or issues brought up by peer participants. (2) 
 The four day conference begins with a presentation given by the experts of their answers to the questions from the citizen panel. The second day is reserved for discussion between the citizen panel, the experts, and the audience as well as clarifying questions. The rest of the second day and the following third day is reserved for the citizens panel to generate a final document which explains their conclusions along with recommendations. An open discussion is formed which includes much deliberation and conversing to where a final consensus of the document is reached. Throughout the morning of the fourth day, the citizen panel reads the final document to the experts along with the audience and/or press. (3) 
 Influence, Outcome and Effects Know what kinds of effects this method typically has? Help us complete this section!Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 An interesting aspect about the consensus conference is the fact that not all of the conferences are evaluated. A formal evaluation may not be required if the conference has become a known tool with no plans on future conferences as well as having the conference be carried out by an experienced organizing team. For the conferences that require an evaluation, the first step is deciding whether the evaluation should focus on internal or external aspects. 
 Internal aspects include the appropriateness of the selected experts, the quality of the interactions between the two panels, and the competence of the moderation and the quality of the output. External aspects include the effects of the conference. This could consist of whether the relevant audiences were reached, and/or the evaluations along with questions if the lay panel made a difference in the debates on the specific topic of technology or science in question among policy makers, experts and the wider public. The evaluation of the consensus conference can be carried out by either the organizing team and/or be outsourced to external evaluators. A crucial step of the evaluation process is that the conference is evaluated in relation to the goals formulated in advance. In order to achieve this process, both the organizing team and/or the external evaluators must be aware of the premise to which the conference has been organized (2).

Town meetings allow residents to voice their opinions on public issues and deliberate and vote on laws and budgets. ""Proponents of the town assembly emphasize that it is the purest form of democracy that ensures that all policy decisions are in the public interest since no intermediaries are placed between the voters and the public decisions.""[1] In this regard, it differs slightly from  Representative Town Meetings  which also have a long history in  New England . Unlike the  Representative Town Meeting , the New England format allows any and all citizens to directly deliberate and vote on legislation. As such, state historian Christopher Collier has called it “the most democratic form of government one can imagine. It's the closest to the people, it involves the largest number of people, it's the most open.”[2] In more recent decades, the integration of  information and communications technologies  like  Audience Response Systems  has allowed the New England Town Meeting format to maintain relevance in the  21st Century  'digital age'.  The purpose of the New England Town Meetings is to include registered voters of the community to decide new laws and budgets in a town forum. In more modern times, New England Town Meetings have suffered a drop in attendance attributable to the increase in town size and a decrease in the number and variety of political issues under local control. While their purpose continues to be the granting of an open, impartial forum for public opinion, John Gastil notes that meetings are less ‘open’ than they used to be; composed primarily of stakeholders and invited guests, participants often “simply tell committee members what they want to hear.""[3]  Origins and Development  The New England Town Meetings first began in the New England colonies at the beginning of the 1600s. Having travelled to America to pursue religious freedom, the Puritans quickly developed a method of town meeting with which to discuss and decide on community-specific matters. The meetings were held in colonial meeting houses which, except in Rhode Island, were built at taxpayer expense and served both religious and town business purposes.[5] Town Meetings were thus developed to preserve local autonomy and self-government over issues such as religious freedom and tax laws.  Town meetings have been ongoing since that time in Connecticut, Maine, Vermont,  Massachusetts , Rhode Island, and a few other New England states. Some states or communities - like Amherst, Massachusetts - adopted or transitioned to/from the  Representative Town Meeting  model.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  The meetings are open to the general public. Some town meetings can be larger than others depending on the location and what issues are on the ballot. In general, local and regional officials attend to  listen and answer questions . Members of community-based organizations or stakeholder groups may also be invited. Recruitment for Town Meetings does not appear to have caught up to other participatory events which increasingly make use of  social media . Most meetings see the same participants or, depending on the agenda for that evening, dedicated stakeholders and interest groups.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  A typical New England Town Meeting allows any registered voter the ability to speak and vote. Before each meeting, citizens may request that an item be placed on the night's agenda (called a ""warrant""). In the case of regular (monthly) meetings, it is usually the executive - the Select Board or Board of Selectmen - or citizens on volunteer committees that place items on the warrant. However, during annual meetings - typically held in the Spring - 10 or more citizens are allowed to petition the Board to have an item placed on the warrant. Similarly, Special Town Meetings, which are generally held in the fall time, allow 100 citizens to have an item added to the warrant.  While Town Meetings generally follow a set schedule, Select Boards are legally obligated to hold a Meeting if 200 citizens  petition  to have one.  New England Town Meetings are also called ""Open"" Town Meetings because they allow all citizens to deliberate. Voters and non-voters alike are given the opportunity to speak but only at the discretion of an elected Moderator. The general procedures of each meeting are determined by a town's bylaws and/or charter and also follow the rules set out in the 'Town Meeting Time,' a document issued by the Massachusetts Moderators Association.  Through the moderator, deliberation is kept orderly and on-point. Speakers are required to stay on topic when discussing an article under consideration by voters and no member is allowed to address another without the permission of the Moderator. Personal attacks are prohibited, and citizens may be ejected from a meeting if they do not adhere to the rules.Deliberation  is an essential step in the process as it allows participants to discuss, debate, and amend motions before voting on them. Once a consensus has been reached or no more speakers are forthcoming, the moderator calls on those in favor and then on those in opposition to raise their voting cards. A tally of votes is not usually conducted unless the moderator is in doubt or if at least seven voters speak out in doubt of the called result. If a count is needed, tellers may be called upon or, in more recent years, some towns are turning to  electronic keypads  which automatically tally and display the number of votes for an against.ExamplesThe Open Town Meeting format has been used in  Massachusetts  since 1680. This meeting is primarily a local law-making body. ""The development of the finance committee as a valuable adjunct represents the most important change in the town meeting structure in these towns.""[6] In order for a open town meeting to occur, one must summon a warrant on what to discuss and there is a facilitator present to make sure members stay on track. This ensures the public that the meeting will have a voted outcome at the end. Some town meetings in the sate follow the representative (limited) town meeting format, like  the town of Amherst .  The Vermont Open Town Meeting began in 1777 in Windsor. The outcome of the first meeting was to solve the dispute between New Hampshire and Vermont.  ""And whereas the Territory, which now comprises the State of Vermont, did antecedently of right belong to the government of New Hampshire, and the former Governor, thereof, viz. his excellency Benning Wentworth, Esq. granted many charters of lands and corporations within this State to the present inhabitants and others. And whereas the late Lieutenant-Governor Colden, of New York, with others, did, in violation, of the tenth command, covet those very lands.""[7]  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  The New England Town Meetings try to ""ensure that all policy decisions are in the public interest since no intermediaries are placed between the voters and the public decisions.""[8] The effect should be to improve one's community by discovering during these meetings what is really needed. Legislation voted on during these meetings has ranged from schools and educational material to public amenities and zoning laws.  The legacy of the Open Town Meeting as both a method and symbol for local self-governance has been preserved thanks to the efforts of participatory democrats.  AmericaSpeaks  '  21st Century Town Meeting  format updated the process for the modern era by integrating  Audience Response Systems  (ARS). Since their development, the 21st Century Town Meeting has been used in numerous countries around the world, successfully establishing the 400-year Open Town Meeting tradition as a go-to method for large-group deliberative decision-making.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Perhaps the largest issue facing the New England Town Meeting is low attendance. According to an observational study of over 1500 town meetings in 2003, Frank Bryan reported “238,603 acts of participation by 63,140 citizens in 210 different towns.”[9] Bryan concludes that this “show[s] that citizens will participate—and often at great cost to themselves—when they know the political arena is small enough for them to make a difference and there are issues at stake that really matter to them.”[10] However, Bryan admits that attendance levels have been steadily dropping which he attributes to an increase in town size and “a decline in the number and variety of issues over which towns have control.”[11] Indeed, the last point is perhaps the most significant when it comes not only to the New England Town Meetings but public participation in local issues in general. In his book  Political Communication and Deliberation , John Gastil states notes that “the most comprehensive study of participation in public meetings found that in the United States in 2003, twenty-five percent of citizens reported attending one or more such meeting in the past year. The overwhelming majority (eighty-five percent) of those who had not attended any meetings said that they had never been invited to one.”[12] One way to solve this problem, is to increase recruitment efforts at younger demographics (using social media, for example). Incentives could also be used. Raffle prizes in the form of free movie tickets or restaurant discounts give willing benefactors new business and increased visibility.  Low levels of civic education or unfamiliarity with deliberation could also be contributing to low attendance rates. Gastil and others have also criticized the deliberative quality of the meetings and time given to minority or dissenting opinions.[4] While New England Town Meetings have been the traditional setting for community-led governance, new forms of public participation may be replacing them or civic engagement in local political issues may simply be declining. Gastil recommends that, when deliberating on a more social level, community members be briefed on how to best deliberate and that the participatory design of meetings allow for the respectful and equal voicing of opinion.[13]  The problem of ‘name-calling’ and generally disrespectful and unconstructive communication at town meetings could also be mitigated through the use of online forums. While such sites have been in use, Gastil notes that a Boston Globe report found they were falling out of favour.[14] Since Gastil was writing in 2008, however, the internet and online forms of public participation are still around. According to Gastil, online forums could include a larger population than just the New England states and help keep the discussion objective. Minority opinions may gain more voice which is another positive since the chances of community improvement increase with the number of solutions considered and deliberated. The key, however, is that deliberation and consensus formation be a final step in the decision-making process and, as Gastil emphasizes, the process of deliberation must ""create a solid information base, prioritize key values, identify a broad range of solutions, weigh the pros and cons, and make the best decision possible.""[15]  See AlsoRepresentative Town Meeting 21st Century Town Meeting   References  [1] Joseph Francis Zimmerman,The New England Town Meeting: Democracy in Action,  (Westport, CT: Praeger, 1999), i.

Dienel [1] , and is designed to be a sort of ""micro-parliament"" in order to improve citizen’s representation, especially vis-à-vis their government representatives. Detlef Garbe notes that planning cells aim to “improve the efficiency of decision-making in the planning process, and to offer new possibilities of political participation by the citizen”. [2]  To do so, in a planning cell, twenty five people from various backgrounds work together to develop a set of solutions to a problem delegated to the participants by a commissioning body. These solutions are then assessed and final recommendations are presented to the commissioning body as a ""Citizen's Report."" [3]Origins and Development  The planning cell as a method for deliberation was created by German Prof. Dr. Peter C. Dienel in 1972. [4]  Professor Dienel developed the planning cell in response to problems he noticed with the relationship between government officials and ordinary citizens. Noticing an increasing trend in which citizens did not feel their elected representatives shared the same interests and values as their own, Dienel sought to create a program whereby people could begin to represent themselves. In the past, Dienel noted that public officials had sought to improve relations with citizens by increasing the efficiency of government entities and providing quicker response times when people expressed dissatisfaction with the government. These solutions for Dienel, however, were unsatisfactory and the German professor introduced the method of planning cells to increase the independence of citizens and give them a tool for self-representation. [5]  Since the inception of the planning cell in the German town of Schwelm, planning cells have been used over 170 times at more than 40 locations. [6]Participant Recruitment and Selection  Duties for organizers include creating the schedule, finding a location to host the cell, identifying experts and interest group representatives who are well-informed on the problem addressed in the cell, and finding citizens to actually participate in the planning cell. The twenty-five participants in the planning cell must be randomly selected [7]  and composed of people directly affected by the policy issue and those indirectly affected. Also, participants in a planning cell must be paid for their time, including compensation for participation as well as reimbursement of lost wages. [8]  This ensures that members of a planning cell take their job seriously and focus on the cell's objective while also being inclusive of those for whom financial burdens can be a barrier to participation.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  In order to successfully implement a planning cell, there are several steps that must be taken.  After organizers have selected 25 participants, they are organized into a planning cell. A commissioning body (usually a city or county) then delegates a problem to the cell that needs to be addressed. These issues are related to things like government funding, civic programs, and political institutions. Next, in order to tackle the problem given to the planning cell, participants work through three distinct phases.  In Phase I, citizens' become informed about the issue through a series of lectures, videos, and written pamphlets. [9]  During this phase, experts and interest group representatives also have a chance to address the planning cell so that the participants may gain an understanding of the perspectives of all interested parties. Once all of this information is received by the cell members, they may  ask questions  and seek clarification before entering into Phase II.  In Phase II, participants process information received in Phase I through group discussions. [10]  The 25-person cell is divided into five smaller groups of five people each, and each group is responsible for prioritizing values and identifying criteria to help analyze the problem. [11]  During this phase, members are expected to develop a number of recommendations and then choose one to share with the larger group. In order to choose this recommendation, group members rate each decision based on the values they determine to be most important and then vote on their preferred choice.  In Phase III, the recommendations developed and voted on by each small group are then presented to the larger 25-person assembly. After all of the participating citizens are made aware of the various solutions, the options are evaluated by the entire group. This evaluation can take many forms. Often, members of the cell will grade or assign points to policy options or vote on various alternatives. Moderators then record these evaluations to develop a final report.  The final report, created by the moderators of the planning cell, summarizes the results of the cell, provides a description of the procedures followed, and identifies the problem addressed. [12]  The initial draft of this report is given to all members of the planning cell first so that they may review and make changes if necessary. After edits are made by participants, the final report is then published and presented to the commissioning body. [13]Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Dienel argues that planning cells have “proved an effective aid to resolving hardened conflicts and producing consensual outcomes” while the recommendations resulting from the consultations have also influenced decision-makers. [14]  The influence and outcomes of the planning cell methodology can be seen in its application in three countries.GermanyIn August 1982, the German Ministry of Research and Technology utilized planning cells to identify the interests of German citizens in regards to four different energy policy options. [15]  The three year study, utilizing 24 separate planning cells in seven communities throughout West Germany, sought to identify the public's preferences for each energy program and the underlying motivations behind those preferences. [16]  At the end of the study, researchers found that the planning cells favored the policy option that focused on energy conservation and the efficient use of energy.  In 1992, the Federal Ministry of Postal Service and Telecommunication commissioned a series of 22 planning cells to discuss and form recommendations regarding the ""future telephone."" [17]  All together, 85,000 statements were issued. The final citizen report was given to the ministry and included 66 recommendations that dealt specifically with data protection in telecommunications; several of these proposals were adopted by the German government. [18]SpainThe Basque Region of Spain has experienced intense ethnic conflict and policy stagnation, but with the help of planning cells, was able to successfully resolve a long standing dispute over the construction of a gymnasium in the early 1990's. [19]In 1997, the Regional Department of Transportation commissioned 14 planning cells to  deliberate  the creation of a major highway through the Basque Region. The cells helped evaluate existing plans for the highway, consider alternative routes, and identify the social and political effects of each option.United StatesIn 1988, the Department of Environmental Protection of New Jersey utilized planning cells to create recommendations for regulating sewage sludge at a Rutgers University research farm. The planning cell used in this case rejected the farm's preference for using the land for sludge application.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  According to Professor Dienel, planning cells are beneficial for individuals participating in the cell, for policy creation, and for society as a whole. [20]Individual participants benefit from planning cells because they are empowered in the deliberative process. Planning cells rely on citizens to make decisions and design original solutions to problems. This task requires a large responsibility and can lead many participants to develop stronger social identities as they evaluate and support their opinions.  Policy creation is also uniquely aided by planning cells. Because a large part of the process of planning cells involves informing participants about all sides of an issue, citizens are highly competent and knowledgeable when it comes to shaping policies and they can better foresee the consequences of different legislative options. Also, the random selection of members in a planning cell means that everyone has the opportunity to partake. [21]  This results in cells that for the most part mirror the general population and therefore decisions made by the planning cell will most likely be accepted by the people as a whole. Finally, planning cells benefit policy creation because the results of a cell are completely open. Rather than having pre-defined solutions that participants vote on, cells are responsible for creating their own unique policy recommendations. This leaves room for creativity and ingenuity when presenting solutions.  Society benefits from planning cells because the deliberative method restores trust in democratic institutions. People often complain of a disconnect between government and the general population, and planning cells help to close this gap by giving participants the chance to have power in the decision making process. Also, society may be more willing to accept a policy decision if they know it was created by a group of randomly selected and non-privileged citizens.  Given these advantages, however, there are also limitations to planning cells as a deliberative method. For one, cells are not adept at resolving issues between different regions or social groups. A group of randomly selected citizens are not skilled in the intricacies of handling intense ethnic or regional conflict. Another issue is accountability. Because planning cell participants are only responsible for designing the decision and not implementing it, the policy options they create may not be financially or physically viable. Also, planning cells are time and resource intensive. Though a typical planning cell lasts 4 to 7 days, they require months of preparation and a great deal of time after the cell adjourns to draft and disseminate a citizen's report. Because of this large time window and the emphasis planning cells put on educating participants, the process can end up costing the organizing body a great deal of money.

The ABCD method was developed as a way to provide communities, organisations, and/or institutions with a relatively cheap, effective approach to self-development that avoids dependence.[4] Methodologies that originate at the civic level can empower members of a community to action.  Origins and Development  The ABCD methodology was created by John McKnight and Jody Kretzmann at the Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University.[5] In their co-authored book released in 1993,  Building Communities from the Inside Out , they outline an alternative approach to the needs-based approach used by poor communities.[6] This process empowers communities to “assemble their strengths into new combinations, new structures of opportunity, new sources of income and control, and new possibilities for production.""[7]  In the United States, several communities have mobilized to utilize the ABCD approach to improve economic and social development. In Savannah, Georgia, the community transitioned their responsibilities from being consumers of services to producers of community.[8][9] This gradual shift to mobilization demonstrates that individual resources are often unrealized in a community. The key to ABDC is in the ability of local relationships to drive community development.[10] The strength of these associations can be connected to each other in ways that multiply their effectiveness.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Playing a key role in the process of building successful relationships in disadvantaged communities, community researchers are typically first recruited. They “will share the experiences and backgrounds of the people” of their community and facilitate connections.[11] Primarily, the community researchers are recruited through a job advertisement in the local paper, or networking with community groups.[12] After receiving training, the community researchers are tasked with finding marginalized people to work with for the ABCD mapping process. Recommended community organizations “to approach include: neighbourhood houses, resource and community centres, adult education classes...support groups and life-skills groups”.[13]  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The ABCD self-mobilization process has guidelines for achieving a strong level of community-driven development.[14] These guidelines assist the participant in organizing a group as well as  mapping  the capacities of the community. Variations of this process exist for the use of different NGOs.[15] One such variation was implemented by Synergos, a non-profit organization working to alleviate poverty, that held a workshop in Bangkok on identifying and mobilizing local assets.[16] The typical process outlined by John Kretzmann and John McKnight is described below. Overall, “an extensive period of time is spent in identifying the assets of individuals, associations, and then institutions before they are mobilized to work together to build on the identified assets of all involved . ”[17] After the assets are identified, they are matched with individuals who are in need of them; thus, the key to neighbourhood regeneration is in using what is already available but underutilized in the community.Step 1: Collecting StoriesConducting informal discussions and interviews can provide a forum for citizens to express their experiences from past endeavors.[18] This discussion has a dual effect; not only does it reveal unrealized assets, but it also helps build confidence in a person's personal abilities. This confidence will evoke the motivation to contribute to the sustainable community development process.[19] Significant to this first step is that it “does not diminish but reinforces citizens as the centre of their community.”[20]Step 2: Organizing a Core GroupAs the process of collecting stories continues, certain participants will be distinguishable from the rest as leaders. These committed individuals may have shown leadership aptitude in the past, or they may currently be in a position of authority.[21] Organizing the leaders of the group and compelling them to further explore the assets of the community is of importance. These leaders will network and build relationships with other individuals in the community.[22]Step 3: Mapping Completely the Capacities and Assets of Individuals, Associations, and Local InstitutionsMapping [23] is an extensive process conducted by citizens themselves; the mapping process helps participants learn more about the talents of other community members and will identity links between different assets.[24] Mapping is more complicated than merely collecting data; a large part of the mapping process is in developing new relationships amongst community members. During the mapping processes, the objectives are as follows:[25]Identifying associations : These associations are the backbone of community action and are essential as assets. The associations should be listed by type and those most likely to work together for a common goal should be identified.Identifying individual gifts, skills, and capacities : Every participant should feel as if their gift has been realized and is appreciated.[26] The capacities of each person are placed in categories such as “community-building skills”, “teaching skills”, and “artistic skills.”[27] Other organizations may choose to categorize by skills of the heart, head, and hand.Identifying the assets of local institutions : Assets of institutions could be found in the services they provide, the equipment they have, or the communication links they may provide.[28]Identifying physical assets and natural resources : Natural resources such as land, water, or other resources should be identified as either privately managed or community owned and managed.[29]Mapping the local economy : How does the economy work?[30] Resources should be identified that can be realized for maximum community benefit.[31] Could imported products be produced locally?[32]Step 4: Convening a Broad Representative Group to Build a Community Vision and PlanIn this step, the central organized theme is decided on and matched with different assets, identifying concrete activities to work on.[33] The decisions should be made by those identified as leaders in the earlier steps, in order to emphasize the community-driven aspect of the process. Here, the expectation is that new community relationships are established while existing ones are strengthened.[34] This could be accomplished through other participatory democratic methods.Step 5: Mobilizing Assets for Community DevelopmentIn this step, the processes are initiated as the community assets are mobilized. Further associations are encouraged to engage those with similar interests, leading to “information sharing and realization of what can further be achieved through new connections and association.”[35] Looking for common ground amongst participants and encouraging contribution is necessary.[36]Step 6: Leveraging Activities, Investments and Resources from Outside the Community to Support Asset-Based, Locally Defined DevelopmentBefore external resources are tapped, all local resources must be utilized.[37] This would put the community in a position of strength for furthering the vision of sustainable community development.[38]  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  ABCD is becoming a more popular strategy for community based development, challenging the traditional needs-based approach to assisting neglected communities.[39] Instead, it allows communities to identify their own assets to respond to their own needs, a more sustainable approach to social and economic development that reduces dependency on external organizations. The Mercado Central was an ACBD initiative developed by Latino immigrants in Minneapolis as a retail business cooperative; the community worked together with many organizations and faith-based groups to build a traditional marketplace in their inner-city neighborhood.[40] The market has transformed the community through both its existence as well as the benefits of the process itself.  Current strategies draw from this methodology, including the sustainable livelihood approaches developed by the Department for International Development and the asset building framework employed by Ford.[41] Furthermore, the Greater Rochester Health Foundation launched the Neighborhood Health Status Improvement Program in 2008.[42] This program partners with the ABCD institute and focuses on working to improve the health status of the residents of the community.[43] Five individual projects focus on local issues, such as housing, economic concerns, the environment, and promoting social interaction. This organization is one of many using ABCD methodology to effectively mobilize local residents toward improving community health.  The methodology was also utilized successfully in Seattle’s historic Columbia City district. By 1995, the area was overrun with prostitutes and drug dealers.[44] Recognizing that something had to be done, residents and businesses formed the Columbia City Revitalization Committee.[45] Participants were asked to think of a project that could improve the area; each idea was written on a piece of paper and the papers were posted at the front of the room.[46] Each cluster of ideas was assigned to a meeting place. The participants then continued the discussion that most appealed to them, ultimately resulting in the launching of new community projects.[47] The community's vision and use of resources has resulted in businesses moving back into the area; today, no storefronts are still vacant.[48]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The ABCD methodology both promotes and functions as a result of community  deliberation . Civic engagement is incredibly important in society; the “ABCD stands to gain from the rich resource of tools and methods generated by participatory development practice for community-based research, analysis, planning, and for organizational capacity building.”[49] The method has been used effectively in many communities as they develop their infrastructure and programs to address salient issues using local assets.[50]  ABCD faces several challenges. The real danger exists that the methodology will be discredited as being used as a self-serving initiative for private agencies.[51] Avoiding dependency on the external agency facilitating the process is a major concern.[52] As communities become larger and a greater network of connections are made, central control can be reduced.  Another challenge is that certain environments may not be conducive to the ABCD method. The method may be difficult to enact in hostile environments or places where social hierarchies marginalize certain people.[53] Furthermore, anticipating how the social change will affect the community can help protect the growth of associations. Sharon Lee Bryant, after examining an Australian case study of the ABCD method, suggests that “knowledge about strategy development and implementation” is limited at the local level, producing “fragmented solutions that fail to integrate appropriately the various perspectives of different sectors.”[54] However, importantly, Kretzmann and McKnight note that the methodology is not meant to take the place of other initiatives, but rather to supplement external aid; they write that the “assets within lower income communities...are absolutely necessary but usually not sufficient to meet the huge development challenges ahead.”[55]  See AlsoCommunity Organizing Neighbourhood Management   References  [1] [2] [3] “What is Asset Based Community Development.”  ABCD Institute DePaul University,  accessed February 4, 2019,  https://resources.depaul.edu/abcd-institute/resources/Documents/WhatisAssetBasedCommunityDevelopment.pdf , 2.

Public hearings can be called on more-or-less open topics or else are held on pre-drafted legislation, agendas, or action items.  Most public hearings are held by local or state/regional governments and government agencies but may also be organized by non-governmental, civil society organizations at the local, regional, or even international level. In the United States, more than 97% of local governments hold public hearings.[2] The high instance of hearings is attributable to the numerous state and federal laws which require government agencies to hold public consultations before using government funds or implementing decisions that will affect the general public. Political scientists Abby Williamson and Archon Fung state that “the public hearing is perhaps the most widespread venue for public participation in the United States, used by all levels of government for a variety of purposes.”[3]  However, while public hearings are typically required by law, the agency or organization is not required to base their decision on the views and issues presented at the hearing. Rather, hearings simply offer citizens a chance to share their opinions.[4]  Public hearings “are seen to legitimize controversial decisions taken in several important areas of governmental planning activity.”[5] Hearings give citizens a chance to contribute to the discussion over decisions made by the officials, and as Karpowitz states, “common public hearings are critical institutions for public voice.""[6] Public hearings are thus often called as a way to assert or establish representative legitimacy although this is not always the outcome - especially in cases where the public's opinion is not reflected in the final decision.[7]  Public hearings are comparable to  Citizens' Reference Panels  ,  Direct Representation . A related online version is the  Electoral District Forum  .  Origins and Development  According to participatory planning expert John Forester, the use of public hearings began following the process of the enclosure of public lands that occurred in Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries. At the beginning of the enclosure process, for each plot of land that was going to be enclosed, a separate act of Parliament was required. Public meetings were held in order to create a petition to parliament to enclose the land, and later to hear objections to the act created by Parliament.[8]  Early public meetings were presided over by a commission, who were bound by impartiality. The commissioners were originally assigned, however, in later years there was at least one who was publicly appointed. In 1845, the General Inclosure Act created permanent commissioners who sent all bills to Parliament, and one publicly appointed commissioner who resided over the public meetings to hear citizen concerns. This use of commissions to hear public concerns over the enclosure of lands was one of the first examples of a public hearing, and emphasizes how most public hearings today are used when dealing with public lands as well as private properties.[9]  Public hearings as a consultative process has been used in numerous other scenarios and countries outside of the US legislative context. For example, public hearings are the go-to method for consultation during the yearly  Participatory Budgeting  cycles developed in South and Latin America. As well, several high profile, national-level public hearings (inquiries) have been held in Canada on extremely broad topics such as  Mental Health  , and, most recently, Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  A public hearing is typically held when a government, government agency, or organization is making a decision on a course of action, such as a law or plan for construction. The hearing is organized and held by the government agency or organization in the area where the issue will take place and have the greatest effect. Sometimes it is well publicized in the local media, while other times it is barely mentioned, and the level of publicity mostly depends on the amount of controversy surrounding the issue. The level of publicity, in turn, determines how well attended the hearing will be, ranging from auditoriums full of concerned citizens to a small room with only the officials. For most hearings, the agency holding the hearing must notify all the parties they believe to be interested and affected by the outcome of the decision.[10] The public hearing is then made open to the public, and participants are self-selected individuals as well as the representatives from the government agency or organization. In addition, sometimes experts from fields relevant to the issue will be asked to present information and answer questions.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The structure of each public hearing varies depending on the specifications made by the organizing group; however a typical hearing begins with statements and presentations made by the officials presiding over the hearing. It is also common to have a presentation or educational lecture on the technical aspects of the issue under consideration - especially for issues that center around planning, such as infrastructure and zoning. Following opening presentations the rest of the hearing is devoted to public comments and questions.[11] In an analysis of public hearings in Brazil, Camila Moreira de Castro observed that the main ideas and arguments used by speakers during the hearings were grouped according to their content which proved to be useful for addressing the various demands discussed in public hearings. Some categories were politically-driven and others are more economically/technically-driven.[12]  A moderator is often present to ensure speakers do not go over the allotted time as established by organizers at the beginning of the event. Citizens typically approach a microphone and/or podium, and present facing the officials with backs to the citizen audience.[13]  As Williamson and Fung explain, the type of relationship between the citizens who attend the public hearing and the agency or organization that is making the final decision can be classified as both informational and consultative. Hearings are designated as 'informational' since officials and invited experts devote a significant amount of time to explaining the problem, discussing or defending their proposed actions, and answering the public questions. A hearing is also consultative because the opinions and suggestions are sourced from individuals outside of or unconnected to the decision-makers.[14] While those who speak at the public hearing are typically not involved in the final decision-making process, it is hoped (if not expected) that their ideas and opinions voiced during the consultation often guide or inform it.[15]  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Every public hearing achieves, at the very least, the exchange of information and opinions on a topic. While public participants often expect their opinions to influence the final decision, officials are not obligated to do so.[16] However, by presenting information on the topic and answering public questions - the informational components of the process - public hearings may also serve to sway the public in favour of officials' proposed decisions or else communicate why a certain course of action may be taken. While the final decision may go against the public opinions or suggestions voiced at the hearing, the process at least makes the process somewhat transparent.  As well, the consultative aspect of the hearing can improve public perceptions of the organizing body. Public hearings are often called by governments to assert or establish representative legitimacy. Hearings called by public agencies or NGOs can garner them public support which can be a way to legitimize their actions to other organizational or decision-making bodies.[17] However, a study of public hearings used during North Carolina's water quality planning in the late 1970s found that over half of hearing participants were representatives of organized economic interests. Other studies in the United States have corroborated the fact that organized interests tend to dominate public hearings, most of which have an economic stake in the decision.[18]  As well, since those who call the hearing are not legally mandated to follow the advice or suggestions obtained, they can risk alienating the public or attracting criticism from participants. One way to minimize this is for officials to release thorough documentation of the decision-making process, including how input from the public hearings was or was not taken into consideration.  The outcomes of public hearings vary widely although anecdotal evidence suggests that, in the United States, public hearings are used by local government officials to gauge public  support in order to make their decisions. Unlike polls and surveys, public hearings allow citizens to express the intensity of their concerns, disagreements, or approvals. In this way, local officials get a preview of the potential political consequences of a decision before they make it.”[19]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Analyzing procedures in hearings, Rowe and Frewer and Irvin and Stansbury observe that they are limited to engaged citizens; the actual participants are experts.[20] ""It has been used to respond the demand of public participation, getting a group of citizens together so that they can be persuaded by the official point of view.""[21] Such participation methods (referenda and public hearings) seem to be employed just for meeting public involvement needs, regarding them as an end in themselves rather than a tool with a specific purpose.Fiorino presents four criteria to assess public involvement and public hearing: (i) the direct participation of amateurs in decision making; (ii) the participation of citizens in collective decision making; (iii) the length of time available for a face to face discussion; and (iv) the opportunity for citizens to participate on an equal basis with administrative officials and technical experts.[22]  People with low income and those under 18 years of age tend to be inadequately represented and unable to make significant contributions. There is extensive scholarly literature claiming that those who attend public hearings are not representatives of the population; they are often dominated by people able to invest and make significant contributions.[23]  Deliberative Aspects  Due to their dry subject matter and time requirements, holding or attending a public hearing can be seen as unfavourable by citizens and officials.[24] However, there are many aspects that make it a good example of a  deliberative process  - at least in theory.  First, by allowing citizens to present their views on issues, officials are able to get a better sense of the public support or opposition to a particular issue.[25] Even though officials may or may not ultimately be swayed in their decision by these public comments, the hearing allows citizens the chance to feel as though their voice was heard. The chance to speak can also provide an opportunity for citizens to “change the behavior of their elected representatives by providing information, making a show of support, delaying decisions, shaming, and agenda setting.”[26] In addition, while the time constraint of the public hearing can limit some voices, it allows for the equal opportunity of all viewpoints to be presented, without one person dominating the discussion at any time.[27] This equality can also provide a greater opportunity for minority opinions to be heard by the officials. However, one of the greatest benefits of a public hearing - at least in theory - is the creation of a fora for face-to-face discussions on different sides of an issue, especially between elected officials and citizens. On paper, if not in practice, public hearing is an opportunity for citizens to communicate with those making decisions in a process other than simply voting on a ballot or sending an email.[28]  Anti-Deliberative Aspects  However, although the ideal public hearing would have those deliberative aspects outlined above, that is usually not the case, and much of the literature published on the subject has outlined three major issues with public hearings. The first problem with public hearings is timing, since most hearings are held later in the decision-making process.[29] This timing invites more complaints from citizens, rather than a discussion of pros and cons, and causes those citizens to “perceive that those ‘hearing’ their input have already chose to ignore it.”[30] The second problem is the structure of the meeting. Citizens are usually only able to give brief statements, which does not provide the appropriate speaking time to develop different opinions. The “testimonial format” does not give a chance for citizens to develop and exchange ideas and solutions, and instead causes them to “take on the role of activists advocating their cause.”[31] In addition, because most public hearings are held by government agencies for things such as planning or construction, the conversation can be technical, making it difficult for those who are not experts in the field to understand the discussion.[32] A third problem that was exposed in a study by Cook, Delli Carpini, and Jocobs found that the percentage of the public that attends public meetings is only at 25%.[33] Similarly, the majority of people who attend the meetings tend to be more educated and wealthy, leading to a disproportionate representation of view points. As Williamson argues, those who attend public meetings tend to be those with the most interest and economic stake in the outcome of the decision. Furthermore, those who speak tend to be those with the most intense opinions, whereas most people who attend a hearing do not speak at all. This sometimes disproportionately high level of extreme positions can make it difficult to arrive at any kind of consensus.[34] However, as Karpowitz also points out, there have been numerous studies that have shown contradictory findings, or no statistically significant findings at all, about the type of view points that are present at hearings.[35]  Suggested Improvements  Karpowitz suggests two improvements that could be implemented to help hearings become more deliberative. First, he suggests that all hearings begin with a welcome statement by the officials presiding over the hearing, acknowledging all the groups present. By recognizing the different viewpoints, people will feel more comfortable talking, and may encourage more viewpoints to be discussed. In addition, if the officials acknowledge the parties present, those who are speaking are more likely to feel as though the officials are really listening to what they have to say. The second suggestion is to allow more time for the officials to respond to the comments made by citizens. Instead of just a brief, “Thank you,” if officials respond to each comment, it will foster a better discussion, moving away from the advocacy feel of the hearing.[36]  See AlsoCanadian Senate Public Consultations on Mental Health, Mental Illness and Addiction Services (2006) Citizens' Hall Mongolia Philadelphia: Tight Times, Tough Choices Public Hearings on Construction of the Belo Monte Dam   References  [1] Williamson, Abby and Archon Fung, “Public Deliberation: Where We Are and Where Can We Go?,” National Civic Review 93, no. 4 (Winter 2004): 8.

The ideology protruding behind consensus conferences redefines the path to arrive at a public good. A consensus conference - related to but different from a consensus forum - can be defined as, “a chaired public hearing with an audience from the public and with active participation of 10-15 people, referred to as the jury or panel, and a corresponding number of different experts.” (cefic).  Essentially, Consensus Conferences are a meeting held in order to represent the average society member’s view on a particular issue. The overriding goal is to connect the average citizen in a community to the ideas and advancements in the area under contention. For example, many people do not understand the science behind new medical technology and the potential advantages and harmful drawbacks and, therefore, the consensus conference format - with its focus on education - is optimal. As well as informing the public, Consensus Conferences attempt to achieve a more nuanced definition of the issue under review by receiving the public’s opinions on what should and what should not be done. In short,consensus conferences seek to find common ground between a diverse number of individuals on broad and complex issues.  Consensus Conferences are similar although not identical to  Consensus Forums , Citizen Conferences ,  Participatory Consensus Conferences and  Citizens' Juries .  Origins and Development  Consensus Conferences were created in the United States in the 1960’s, and were initially used to resolve issues around emerging biomedical technologies. These conferences were first utilized by the United States regarding the assessment of the health care sector.  In recent years, Consensus Conferences have been further developed by the  Danish Board of Technology Foundation  as  Participatory Consensus Conferences.   The tactic of Consensus Conferences has represented many successful attempts and resulted in positive effects across the world. However, it has been highly concentrated in the United States and Denmark. One example of a Consensus Conference that resulted in outstanding feedback took place in the United Kingdom under Edward Andersson. This conference was held in May of 1999 and represented the public's outlook on radioactive waste management. A random sample of 15 participants focused on “the effective and publicly acceptable long-term management of nuclear waste in the UK, both civil and military, concentrating particularly on intermediate and high level waste.”[1] The panel and experts followed the steps of the process and arrived to a solid form of  deliberation . The Consensus Conference resulted in a copious amount of more informed citizens on the topic of radioactive waste and the situation at hand in their society. Just as well as the United Kingdom’s radioactive waste management Consensus Conference, this policy has been utilized by Denmark for technologies,  Australia for Gene technology  and the use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV infected adults, and the United States for the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Consensus conferences generally draw a panel consisting of a small group of randomly selected citizens.  How it Works: Process, Interaction and Decision-Making  There are many processes underlying this style of deliberation. Consensus conferences usually begin by drawing a panel of randomly selected citizens that research and construct questions in order to present to experts on the date of the conference. This process of researching may involve individual or group examination of a pamphlet or information package provided as well as attending preparatory events or presentations.  The next step has the group of participants construct their presentation to the experts. The ideology behind this step demonstrates the ability of the group to decided what will be discussed in the debate as well as which witnesses will be contributing. The methodology used during this phase can vary but, ultimately, some form of  consensus  or agreement is required. The determining of questions to present to the panel may also allow for the general public to weigh in on which aspects of the issue demand attention.  Preceding the panel’s decisions, lasting anywhere from two weeks to a few days, a conference is held where the press and public are allowed to be present. A head organizer, otherwise known as a facilitator, oversees the conference ensuring that deliberation remains on track. Post the conclusion of the conference, the panel construes a report outlining the conclusions and recommendations which are then circulated to key players regarding the organization at hand and the media. The organization and outlay of the Consensus Conference steps is essential to deriving strong deliberation and hearing the public’s voice. The strategy of this style of deliberation demonstrates an optimal path to uncovering a common good.  Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsKnow what outcomes and effects this method typically has? Help uscomplete this section!Analysis and Lessons Learned  In contrast to how a Consensus Conference operates, there are many different situations and times that this type of deliberation should be utilized and others when it does not fulfill the requirements. Consensus Conferences function at their most optimal prime involving controversial issues at a National level and with subjects that deem complex or are expert dominated. These types of discrepancies perform preeminent because they enable the delivery of views of informed average citizens to other general public citizens in a language suitable. Other citizens will be able to regurgitate the material and will result in a better informed public on the debate at hand. In conclusion, Consensus Conferences enable a complex matter to be broken down into a more generalized form that can be presented by the media to update citizens that do not contain an in depth knowledge in the subject. Differing from perfect Consensus Conference topics, this form of deliberation and informative material should not be exploited when the issue is uncontroversial, contains biased participants, or when the panel is expected to create actual decisions. Consensus Conferences are not intended to derive decisions, make detailed technical recommendations, or be read as a representation of a whole society.

164,method,Initiative Process,https://participedia.net/method/164,The initiative process is a form of direct democracy where citizens can propose legislation which is then put to popular referendum. There are two types of initiative: direct (citizens'/popular) and indirect (agenda/agenda-setting). ,0,2010-06-02,2020-03-27,111,Vicnin,https://participedia.net/user/111,418540,alice.el-wakil,https://participedia.net/user/418540,en,0,both,empower,open,,low,low,direct,,,,,,regional,,,express,,,voting,,,majoritarian,,make,,," Problems and Purpose  The initiative process is a form of democratic participation through which citizens propose a legislative bill or constitutional amendment via a petition.[1] There are two kinds of initiatives: direct or ‘citizens’’ initiatives (also known as popular initiatives) and indirect or ‘agenda’ initiatives (also known as agenda-setting initiatives). Direct initiatives end in a referendum or public vote on the proposed legislation while indirect initiatives leave final decision-making up to elected officials. In both cases, the proposal must gain sufficient public support (signatures or endorsements) before it can be submitted for consideration by the legislature.[2]  Unlike elections, the initiative process is open to citizens at any time, giving citizens a direct channel of democratic voice, action, and influence. In theory, it was developed to allow for free and unfettered self-expression and participation as ""partners"" in the decision-making and legislative procedure.[3] Proponents of the initiative process see it as a way to give citizens the resources and skills to influence what government does (internal efficacy), and to better align government action with citizen opinion or demand (external efficacy).[4]  Where the citizens’ initiative has been implemented, if the government acts in a manner inconsistent with most citizens’ preferences or declines to implement a policy that most citizens prefer, citizens may then bypass the government and directly enact the laws they prefer. Where the agenda initiative has been implemented, citizens may compel an unresponsive government to consider a law or policy that enjoys strong popular support. In both cases, it is assumed that voters are informed about public policy issues and want to make decisions based on informed reason rather party ideology.[5]  Origins and Development  While direct democracy by vote of the people dates back to pre-modern times,[6] the initiative process as an institution of democratic governance originated in Switzerland. Kris William Kobach tracing its development back to the 1798 constitutional system which “laid the foundation for direct democracy at the national level,” containing, as it did, provisions for constitutional referendums and the ability for “assemblies primaires” to submit amendments or revisions. Indeed, the next constitution, in 1802, was submitted to the people for approval via referendum.[7] Beginning in 1830, ‘cantons’ (regions) introduced the ‘optional legislative referendum’ “which allowed citizens to challenge routine laws by petition, thereby bringing the questions before the electorate.” By 1891, the initiative process was institutionalized at both the canton and federal (national) level.[8]  In America, most states in the western half of the country include some form of direct democracy - initiative or popular referendum - while most states on the eastern and southern regions include few or none of these forms. States that joined the United States after the Civil War are more likely to have direct democracy, possibly due to the influence of Progressives - supporters of increased citizen involvement in government - during the late 1800s and early 1900s.[9] The first state to adopt the citizens’ initiative was South Dakota in 1898. As of 2016, 24 states have some type of initiative process. 16 states allow for direct initiatives and 2 states allow for indirect initiatives on constitutional amendments. 14 states allow for direct initiatives and 9 states allow for indirect initiatives on state statutes.[10]  The following country statistics are from IDEA International’s Direct Democracy Database[11]: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1J5H4GuirgluPTfs8_hfk5o8k3Sg3h6NY  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Generally speaking, anyone living under the jurisdiction of an authority which allows for citizens’ to propose legislation through direct or indirect initiative may do so. Laws and restrictions regarding eligibility vary depending on the political entity involved. In the United States, citizens’ initiatives (ballot initiatives) have increased in popularity since the early 1990s, causing many state legislatures to heighten the barriers to participation. For example, some states have increased the number of signatures that must be collected before a proposal can make the ballot which increases the cost associated with organizing an initiative.[12] The European Citizens’ Initiative provides a free online platform to collect signatures which decreases the cost of participation somewhat since an initiative must have over 1 million signatures to be considered.[13] The advent of the internet and online channels of communication has, arguably, lowered the costs associated with organizing an initiative: locating supporters, gathering signatures, coordinating promotional events, discussing next steps, and sharing ideas.[14]  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The first step in both the direct and indirect initiative process is the drafting of a legislative proposal. This is done by any member of the public, either individually or as a group or organization. Petitioners must then seek public support for their proposal in the form of signatures. The required number of signatures depends on the political entity involved. Larger municipalities and provinces in Europe generally require 3% of the population while smaller jurisdictions may require as high as 15%.[15] After receiving the minimum number of signatures required by the legislative body whom they are petitioning, the proposal is then submitted and accepted by governing authorities. This is the point at which the direct and indirect versions of the initiative process diverge.  Direct Initiative  Once accepted by authorities, the draft proposal is put to popular vote through a ‘ballot measure’ (in the United States) or referendum.[16] Some citizens’ initiative processes allow the government to make a counter-proposal to the measure which is included on the public ballot or referendum. As well, some regions in the United States allow for a Citizens’ Initiative Review: a citizens’ jury held to consider the initiative before it goes to public vote via a ‘ballot measure’. The Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review is one example of this process but it has been replicated in other states. The outcome of the review is then published as a voters’ guide before the public ballot measure is held.[17]  In the absence of a formal deliberative process, citizens rely on several different sources of information to gather information before voting on the initiative. In many jurisdictions, the government distributes non-partisan information booklets called a voters’ guide or voters’ pamphlets.[18] Depending on jurisdictional regulations, advocates supporting or opposing an initiative may distribute information and arguments about initiatives through unofficial voters’ guides, political campaigns, and various forms of advertising and other promotional materials including op-ed articles in news media, Internet marketing, social media marketing, media appearances, and public events.[19] In some cases, news or civil society organizations may hold public forums – online or in-person -- for citizens to learn more about the initiative and hear advocates’ arguments for-and-against.[20]  The following is an overview of the kinds and sources of information available to California as reported by the non-partisan Center for Governmental Studies[21]: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HZAnMLMJxFSi_hrHaDdgpEyrtqYyQeUT  Indirect Initiative  The indirect initiative (agenda initiative or agenda-setting initiative) is also submitted to the relevant governing authorities once it gains enough signatures. However, the final decision over the proposed legislation is left up to the relevant authorities.[22] While a public vote on the initiative is not mandatory, as in the case of the direct or citizens’ initiative, some agenda-initiative processes nevertheless invite citizens to participate through deliberative consultation or referendum after the measure has been submitted and considered by the legislature. An example of this kind of initiative is the European Citizens' Initiative, the first transnational direct democratic tool in history which allows a group of citizens, with the support of one million others from across Europe, to request changes in European law. Because it is an indirect initiative process, the ECI is not a referendum right and does not initiate a popular vote. While the European Commission retains the right to initiate legislation, an ECI does force a consideration if it successfully completes the steps along the way.[23]  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  In the United States, citizens’ initiatives have been used to successfully press for the adoption of state statutes and constitutional amendments altering affirmative action, reproductive rights, gay rights, bilingual education, public health, immigration, environmental protection, taxes, spending, education, and welfare policy.[24] Legislation has been passed via citizens’ initiative on women’s suffrage, the removal of poll taxes, the establishment of presidential primaries, and the construction of so-called ‘sunshine laws’ which ensure public meetings are open and transparent in their transcription.[25] As well, the citizens’ initiative in the United States has led to institutional reforms “capping campaign finance contributions, providing for the public financing of candidates, limiting the terms of elected officials, opening “closed” primaries, enacting mail voting, and restricting legislatures’ ability to tax and spend.”[26]  In their assessment of the citizens’ initiative process in the United States, political scientists Caroline Tolbert, John Grummel, and Danial Smith note the following ‘indirect’ outcomes:An alteration of the democratic process to mandate candidates and their state and national parties debate divisive issues during political campaigns  An elevation of the stature of political consultants in state elections due to the large amounts of money spent on some measures  A possible increase in voter turnout through increased motivation to participate due to a heightened sense of civic duty and political efficacy[27]Some scholars and public commentators have claimed that citizens can become more informed, knowledgeable and aware if granted a greater stake in their democracy through, for example, a direct channel of participation such as the citizens’ initiative. First, ballot measures may enhance citizens’ sense of political efficacy by giving them a stronger sense of their ability to affect policy. This will motivate them to better understand political topics. Second, initiatives may increase media coverage of politics, thereby providing people with non-costly information and in turn increasing their knowledge. Writing in the London School of Economic Blog, political scientists Nicholas R. Seabrook, Joshua J. Dyck and Edward L. Lascher, Jr. note that, while it is possible that direct democracy may help increase citizens’ levels of knowledge about policy-specific issues, especially those that may be under consideration on the ballot in a given election, there is no evidence that the use of direct democracy has any positive effect on citizens’ overall levels of political knowledge outside of this limited context. Their study, published in the journal Political Behavior, found that, of those elections studied, none of the measures of ballot initiative usage or exposure were associated with a significant positive effect on general political knowledge.[28]  In a 2004 study, Lupia and Matsusaka found that, in the United States, “over the past four decades, the initiative has tended to bring about more fiscally and socially conservative policies at the state level than would occur otherwise.”[29] However, In his review of the use of the initiative process in the United States, Thomas Cronin found that ""voters have been cautious and have almost always rejected extreme proposals.""[30] Indeed, research suggests that, at least in some circumstances, initiative processes have led to the enactment of legislation that benefits most citizens but which are inconsistent with the interests of incumbent legislators. For example, initiatives that create new and effective governmental bodies or that impose taxation caps or term limits.[31] Research also shows that initiative processes may benefit citizens by increasing citizens’ participation in politics as well as citizens' sense of empowerment[32] although this is contested.[33] As well, the direct initiative process has been popular in the United States with approximately 80 percent of Americans supporting ""a national referendum system in which all citizens voted on proposals that deal with major national issues.""[34]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Academic Studies and Suggested Improvements  Research suggests that voters often receive inadequate information about initiatives.[35] Some surveys show that voters have low levels of awareness and knowledge of initiatives. In the U.S. initiatives are frequently invalidated by courts on the grounds that the initiatives conflict with constitutional or other law; this suggests that voters often receive inadequate information about the legal aspects of initiatives.[36] Further, the language of initiatives and voters’ guides frequently exceeds the reading ability of most voters, and campaign advertisements about initiatives often contain false or misleading claims.[37] This evidence suggests the initiative processes in many jurisdictions could be improved by increasing the quality of information citizens receive about initiatives before a vote is held.[38]  As well, the language of the ballot question itself can be confusing. John Gastil, Justin Reedy, and Chris Wells note that, “the counterintuitive nature of the ballot question, which often seek[s] to repeal or overturn existing laws or regulations, set[s] up a situation in which a “Yes” vote is a vote against a policy, and vice-versa for a “No” vote.[39] The authors go on to advocate for a deliberative step in the initiative process which would fulfill Robert Dahl’s argument for “improve[ments to] citizens’ capacities to engage intelligently in political life [through] older institutions [being] enhanced [with] new means for civic education, political participation, information, and deliberation that draw creatively on the array of techniques and technologies available in the twenty-first century.” The Citizens’ Initiative Review’s use of a deliberative mini-public to review and debate the initiative and to issue a non-partisan voters’ guide before the ballot measure is, according to the authors, a potential remedy to the downsides of the generic citizens’ initiative process where “voter information is inadequate, where deliberation suffers, and where public policy outcomes are suboptimal as a result.”[40]  A 2015 study which found no correlation between ballot initiative usage or exposure and general political knowledge should, according to political scholars Nicholas R. Seabrook, Joshua J. Dyck and Edward L. Lascher, Jr., be sobering for advocates of participatory theory and direct democracy who have argued that direct democracy is at least a partial cure for voter apathy, as well as for scholars who have offered more favorable overall assessments of the ballot initiative process generally. And for Europeans hearing claims that adoption of direct democracies in their own countries would help to invigorate citizen political engagement, their advice was “be suspicious.”[41]  Influence of Wealth &amp; Special Interest Groups  A common charge leveled at direct democracy is that they subvert the policy process, allowing for wealthy, well-organized interest groups to push for legislation in the interest of the few, not the many.[42] However, a 2004 study, Lupia and Matsusaka conclude that accusation to be largely unfounded (at least in the United States). From their analysis, the authors reach two conclusions regarding the effect of wealth and influence on the initiative process: “First, the deep pockets of business groups do not allow them to “buy” favorable policy, but they do provide leverage in fighting off measures the groups oppose. Second, citizen groups do appear to be able to use their wealth to gain approval for measures. Thus, it seems that money matters, but in a nuanced way. The spending evidence also suggests why the initiative process does not lead to policies contrary to the wishes of the majority (see below): Without preexisting public support, the financial resources of business groups are ineffective in changing the status quo, and the financial resources of most citizen groups are too scarce to bring about much change.”[43]  Daniel Lowenstein performed a detailed comparison of spending and election outcomes in twenty-five California ballot propositions from 1968 to 1980. His study was intended to confirm or deny the observed pattern “indicating that one-sided spending has been ineffective when it is in support of the proposition but have been almost invariable successful when it is in opposition.”[44] He found no direct, easy answer to the question. Although six out of the nine propositions with big opposition spenders “would have had excellent chances of passing if the campaign spending had been more equal,” Lowenstein contends that “the fact that as many as four initiatives were approved in the face of disparate opposition spending is sufficiently surprising” and pushes back against the case for campaign finance reform.[45] Indeed, money and big spending did work in some cases, but in others they were self-defeating. For example, mismanagement of a campaign could lead to a defeat regardless of money invested.[46] Money spent on “crude” advertisements “attracted adverse media comment” leading to defeat.[47] Messaging was also important, with persuasive supporters able to defeat opponents that outspent them $288,277 to $3,097 in the case of an initiative on utility rates.[48]  The Initiative ‘Elite’ &amp; the High Rate of Initiative Nullification  In an attempt to understand the high rate of initiative nullification by legislatures in the United States, Matthew Manwell attempted to characterize the types of ‘elite’ players in the initiative process - those who organize a petition, bring it before a legislature, and prepare to defend it in court if challenged. Manweller identified 6 dominant types - the zealot, the amateur, the lawyer, the professional, the politician, and the victim - with many of them overlapping or carrying one or more characteristics of the other types.[49] The typology is based on two criteria: first, how willing the participant was to “subjugate their values and how willing they were to limit the scope of their legislation in exchange for actual success,” and, second, “why they were opting to use the initiative system at all.” On the first criteria, zealots “would not compromise their policy values at all to ensure political and judicial victory. Given the choice between scaling back a policy preference or increasing the likelihood of judicial nullification, a zealot would choose the latter.” Lawyers and politicians, on the other hand, “were more willing to scale back goals, and compromise their values to protect their initiative from judicial nullification.” Professionals, “who have the resources to be repeat players,” often adopted a strategy of “incremental steps to achieve their ultimate policy goals.” Victims were the most extreme, adopting an ‘all-or-nothing approach’ in response to “feeling they only had one shot at making a difference to ‘protect’ society from the same events they had experienced.”[50] Amateurs apparently don’t put much consideration into the potential need for compromises since they “fail to understand that initiatives may be challenged along procedural as well as content grounds.”[51]  On the second criteria - why the individual was using the initiative process in the first place - Manweller found that, across the board, all types of ‘initiative elite’ used the initiative system “because the more traditional legislative system does not offer access - either they cannot get elected or they cannot get the legislature to consider their policy ideas.” Professionals tend to lean libertarian while zealots “have ideas so far outside the mainstream that powerful interest groups can prevent their ideas from ever making it out of committee.” Lawyers tended to be involved at the ‘fringe’ of traditional politics and politicians using the initiative process were often doing so out of frustration “over the ability of committees and governors to influence, change, and block their legislation.” Amateurs opted for the initiative process because they perceive it as “offering immediate and easy access to politics” while victims see it as a kind of ‘last resort’.[52]  Manwell notes that this typology does not suggest a causal relationship between the type of organizer and the rate of initiative success or failure. Rather, “the typology suggests that different types of initiative elites have their measures struck down by the courts for different reasons,” and that, “by offering a glimpse into the mindset of various initiative elites, one can see the various reasons why they suffer such high rates of judicial nullification.”[53]  Lessons from the ECI: the Largest Indirect Initiative Process  There has been considerable analysis of the European Citizens’ Initiative, the largest implementation of indirect initiative process. Writing in 2012, Sean Deel of the London School of Economics and Political Science noted that the first iteration – ECI 1.0 – has a number of nearly fatal flaws, and more are becoming apparent as groups across Europe register ECIs. The European Citizens’ Initiative Campaign (ECIC), a group that campaigned for the inclusion of the ECI in the EU constitution and now closely monitors its use, has enumerated several of these weaknesses, including the need to simplify the signature gathering process (currently each of the 27 member states can set different rules on what information must be collected, including ID numbers); the need for more support for ECI organisers from the Commission; the need to extend the period for signature collection from 12 to 18 or 24 months; and, crucially, the need to allow ECIs which propose treaty amendments to be admissible.[54]  See AlsoEuropean Citizens' InitiativeOregon Citizens' Initiative Review   References  [1] John Gastil, By Popular Demand: Revitalizing Representative Democracy through Deliberative Elections, (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000), 70.

The ideal is that there are multiple conversations that build off of each other to explore the issue deeply. Participants of World Cafes are encouraged to draw from their own lives, values, and personal experiences so the group can learn from and connect with each other based on these things. An overall goal is for participants to realize or create a shared purpose and goals.  In reality, a World Café can have as many or as few participants as the host(s) want, whether that is only a handful of people or thousands. The cost of a World Café is only as much as the host(s) would like to spend; generally the costs are those of the materials needed/desired at the World Café such as table cloths, markers, paper, name tags, food and drink. And because anyone can hold a World Café, they all look different, are held by different organizations and people, and have different goals and purposes.  World Cafés are related to  Conversation Cafes ,  Socratic Cafés , and  Kitchen Table Conversations .  Origins and Development  In 1995 the Intellectual Capitol Pioneers, a global, interdisciplinary group, hosted a two-day dialogue that resulted in deep, innovative, effective conversation. Impressed with their experience, the hosts did further research and experimentation and voila, birthed the World Café design principals and its core concepts.  In the fifteen years since its commencement hundreds of groups, small and large, have used the World Café method to generate productive conversation. One major milestone for the World Café was in August of 2007, when more than eighty hosts and participants from sixteen countries attended the World Café Stewardship Dialogue to explore World Café opportunities, what the World Café needs in order to thrive for years to come, and to share responsibility for those next steps.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  It is up to the host who to invite to the event and how.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Anyone can host a World Café; all that is needed is a purpose, participants, and a meeting place. The host(s) must first define the purpose and who is invited to their World Café, name their Café appropriately, and send invitations to the guests on their list. The next step is creating a hospitable space, welcoming your guests, and defining the purpose of the World Café to the group. The World Café should be organized into groups of four or five people per table rotating from table to table between three (or so) twenty to thirty minute conversational rounds. There should be progressively deeper questions, ideas, and/or themes to explore at each round and they should be clearly stated/posted to keep the conversations on track. A table host should be stationed at each table that will stay there for all of the rounds and summarize each groups findings to the next group to learn from and build off of. At the end of the conversational rounds, groups should have some time to summarize their key findings and then present them to the entire group at the end. Next, the group as a whole convenes to connect all of the ideas into just a few shared key points. The most helpful guide to holding a successful World Café is to follow the six design principles. [2]Design principles1. Set the Context:  Have a clear idea of the “what” and “why” of the meeting. Envision ideal outcomes and try to figure out how you can direct the café toward those outcomes. What is the topic of your World Cafe? Who should participate? How much time (how many days) do you have to discuss the issue?2. Create a Hospitable Space:  A café ambiance, with comfortable seating and soft lighting to create a relaxed, social setting, will encourage comfortable, productive discussion. Multiple tables scattered around the room covered with brightly colored tablecloths, small floral centerpieces, and coloring supplies, as well as some soft background music, are all encouraged to create a hospitable space. Maybe serve food and refreshments to make the setting more social in order to invite conversation. And, of course, make sure the environment is also socially comfortable – people feel comfortable to speak freely and openly.  Since the invitation helps to create the setting, the World Café suggests sending out colorful invitations with plenty of graphics to set a familial tone. The invitation should also include the central theme or question to be explored.3. Explore questions that matter:  The central questions or themes of discussions should be relevant to the actual concerns of the people present at the meeting. The depth of the question a World Café takes on may depend on the amount of time available; less time may allow for the exploration of only one simple question while more time could allow more, deeper exploration of a question through several rounds of discussion. The World Café has come up with some helpful guidelines for good questions to explore; the question should: be clear and simple, provoke thought, generate energy, open new possibilities, invite deep reflection, and seek useful insight. [3]  The way in which the question is posed can be crucial to the outcome of the discussion. According to David Cooperrider, posing a question in a way to provoke the ideal discussion dynamic and inquiry outcome is called “appreciative inquiry.” Instead of asking definitive questions like “who is to blame for the problem,” appreciative inquiry indicates asking exploratory questions that encourage participants to explore different possibilities according to their own personal lives and values. It is also important to a World Café discussion to ensure that each participant shares their own values and personal definitions of key concepts such as “truth” so the collective group can explore the issue in a shared light.4. Encourage everyone’s contribution:  An effective World Café includes various viewpoints and life situations so multiple aspects of an issue can be brought up and discussed. The goal of World Café is to connect a diverse group of citizens so that participants can share new intelligence and ideas with one another. In order to ensure that every participant is allowed equal speaking opportunity, a “talking object” should be placed on the table and passed from speaker to speaker. The idea of this object is that only one person at a time may have the object, so only one person at a time may speak, and the rest of the group must listen intently to whoever has the floor. The speaker is expected to stay focused on the topic at hand and to clearly express their thoughts while the listeners are expected to listen with an open, appreciative mind and to allow themselves to be swayed.5. Connect diverse perspectives:  Here is where those coloring supplies can come in handy; creating a shared space on the table for participants to literally draw the accumulating ideas can help them mentally draw connections between differing viewpoints and ideas. Also, there should be a number of conversational rounds with short breaks in-between for participants to change tables so the discussion can really be diverse and, eventually, lead to a deep web of connections. Every new round will bring new ideas and connections which can be drawn from in succeeding rounds to encourage deeper and more meaningful discussion with every new round. With one person fixed at each round to summarize previous conversations, the conversation rounds can be even more effective by allowing so much information to be drawn from and connected to.6. Listen together and notice patterns : Listening effectively is arguably the most important aspect of a World Café. The idea is that an effective listener can easily build off of what is being shared. Because people tend to plan what they are going to say next instead of listening intently to everything this should be pointed out so participants can focus on listening intently. Also, effective listeners should: listen to every person as though that person is truly wise, listen with an open mind, listen to deeper questions and insights, and “listen” for nonverbal cues. Share Collective Discoveries: In order to connect the whole group toward the end of the discussion, each table should summarize the key ideas, insights, themes, and deeper questions discovered through the discussion to share with the larger group. To ensure that each table can effectively share their ideas with the entire group, there should be flip-charts of butcher paper sp tables can display their ideas to the group. After each table has had an opportunity to share, the entire group should reflect on the groups larger findings with questions such as the following: what deeper questions have emerged here? Are there any patterns; if so what do they suggest? What has come to light because of these discussions? If there was a single voice here what would it say?[4]  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  There are many success stories involving World Cafés, here is just one example: The Financial Planning Association in Australia [5] has so far hosted fifteen World Cafes to guide the growth of their new organization which is a result of a merger in January 2000 between two organizations. The merger presented the opportunity to design a new organization, structurally and philosophically. The cafes, which have ranged in size anywhere from 250 to 4000 people, have been successful at supporting this cultural shift as well as generating goals and steps toward making the new organization a success.  World Café meetings have also been used[6]: in California, among mediators of the judicial system; in Australia, among government representatives, citizens, and business leaders; as a class reunion for the first graduation class in the Masters of Arts Leadership and Training from royal Roads University; to discuss cultural activity budget for a town meeting near Oslo; and by Wells Fargo bank to discuss a new technology plan for one bank division.  In Austria and Germany, World Cafés are an essential part of the multi-format "" Vorarlberg Bürgerrät "" process. After a  sortition -based smaller council has done their deep dive with  Dynamic Facilitation  support, they then share their story at a large public meeting called a ""Citizen's Café"" or BürgerCafé, which is organized using World Café methodology. The outcomes of this Council serve as the initial input to the Café, which is then run in traditional World Café format. There have been well over a hundred of these BürgerCafés to date.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  A World Café meeting is what the host(s) makes it. There are plenty of success stories of organizations using the World Café to better their community, policies, technology, environment – whatever needs work. The success of a World Café comes from having clear, meaningful questions to explore and making sure that meetings are set up to facilitate optimum participation.

 The United States' National Issues Forum (NIF) is a nationwide network of locally created public forums oriented towards the deliberation of public and political issues. It is a non-partisan network of smaller forums created nationwide whose goal is to gather people to reason with each other, deliberate and make public decisions together. Participants gather to discuss political issues and matters of public importance. They converse, deliberate, generate solutions to issues, and work together to select the best solution to the problem. NIF supports a healthy democracy by means of encouraging deliberation and interaction between individuals. Forums take place throughout the year and are sponsored by individuals, groups, or organizations which gather together participants. They deliberate on issues big and small such as health care, crime, and obesity. The size of meetings range from smaller in-home meetings to larger town hall meeting style forums. Anyone is able to participate in a forum by finding local meetings scheduled to take place using the calendar provided on the National Issues Forum website. The calendar lists dates, times, contacts, and issues that will be discussed. One may also plan a forum in their own community by contacting a trained moderator to facilitate the meeting.  [1]The greatest issue fueling the creation of the National Issues Forum was a lack of civic education. Although people are surrounded by access to information regarding political conversations, very few seek it out to educate themselves. Most often, civic engagement comes in lieu of a subject that an individual is highly passionate about but involvement is often fleeting. Proposals to change the lack of civic involvement range from incorporating deliberative conversations in elementary and secondary school classrooms to promoting early engagement all the way to encouraging more participation of adults in National Issue Forums. The problems ultimately stem from a lack of education and create a lack of interest in issues not pertaining to a person's immediate life. The National Issues Forum relies on individuals and groups who wish to participate, but sadly due to a low level of education and interest, it brings less participants. Although the NIF is not struggling to find participants, more involvement means greater individual interest in politics and democracy. This chain of events is important in fostering political knowledge throughout the nation. The problem is how to reach groups that are vital to the deliberative quality of issue forums. The key to good deliberation and a successful forum is to involve many diverse individuals, experiences, and ideas. Often times the minority opinions are overlooked, but the incorporation of different perspectives is one of the main goals of the National Issues Forum. The purpose of the National Issues Forum is to provide an outlet for the public to discuss pertinent social and political issues. The end result is to reach a conclusion that allows people of diverse and varied views to arrive at a common ground. The result of the common agreement is to help participants and the public move towards collective action regarding a particular issue. An important point is that participants are encouraged to seriously analyze issues that deeply concern them, and also to educate the public on ways to promote deliberation. The National Issues Forum is also providing school teachers with options to promote deliberation in their classrooms. The website provides material and ideas to help foster early practice of reasonable and respectful discussion in younger individuals. Overall more instruction for young school children can be a positive foundation for greater understanding and participation in deliberative forums in the future. Origins and Development 
 The National Issues Forum started nearly thirty years ago in the summer of 1981. A group of twenty- five leaders held meetings and discussions, back when it was known as the Domestic Policy Association. The group originated after two years of discussions at the Wingspread Conference Center in Wisconsin. Their primary goal was to create a method to encourage citizens to have more involvement and engage in the public policy process. The main agenda was to hold annual dialogues involving domestic policy issues and provide an opportunity for a variety of views and solutions to be openly discussed. For their second meeting, they gathered community based leaders to create a new program which was different and separate from anything that existed at the time. At the third meeting, they developed a list of topics that “had a daily impact on a broad spectrum of the population, would engage public attention and discussion without overwhelming negative emotionalism, and involved both value judgments and technical considerations” (NIF website). They later changed their name from Domestic Policy Association to the National Forum’s Institute in 1989. Each year the National Forum contributes by selecting three topics for the deliberations that occur within the National Issues Forum. The three issues selected for the inaugural year of the National Issues Forum were: retirement and social security, inflation, and job and productivity (NIF). Currently the National Issues Forum facilitates and contributes to deliberation by establishing topics of relevance and public interest on a regular basis.

 How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making 
 The purpose of organizing a forum is to gather participants to discuss issues and deliberate on the best possible solution out of the initial choices given to them. During a forum, a problem is presented by the moderator along with three to four approaches to solving it. These forums provide a highway for ideas, shared experiences, and arguments to flow with the goal of selecting the best approach to the problem.. Each solution is discussed by the group with the guidance of a trained and neutral moderator. The participants are encouraged to read the provided pamphlet or issue book in order to foster a highly deliberative dialogue. Each approach is considered, examining its pros, cons, and trade offs. The responsibility of the moderator is to ask questions to initiate discussion, answer any questions the participants may have, remain neutral, and direct the group discussion in order to maintain a free flow of ideas. The moderator provides the participants an opportunity to express their thoughts and feelings on each of the possible approaches to the issue. a healthy democratic process, all participants have an equal opportunity of being heard. The group initially talks about the benefits of one approach, followed by its disadvantages, and upon completion of discussion, the group moves on to the next approach. Towards the end, the moderator puts each of the proposed solutions to vote. The participants work through the issue by finding common ground and formulating a thoroughly deliberated and well reasoned public judgment.  [3]Issues available for discussion are listed on the National Issues Forum webpage and predetermined for the year. In order to educate the public who are interested in participation, issue pamphlets are devised to summarize nonbiased facts and information regarding the topics. The issue pamphlets provides an overview of the issue along with the few suggested approaches to solving it. Participants are highly encouraged to make themselves familiar with the applicable pamphlet in order to foster the highest possible deliberative discussion. The trained and neutral moderators provided at each meeting help foster deliberation by leading the group conversation. They guide the participants to a discussion of the three to four broad options provided for approaching the issue. With these in place, the moderator’s goal is to then ask questions and steer the group so as to ensure a highly deliberative process, a smooth conversation, and a through coverage of the given approaches. As each possible solution is introduced, the participants engage in deliberation by brainstorming, analyzing, and considering the benefits and disadvantages of each solution. During the process, discussions may cause participants to become unsure of which position to choose, change their original stance, or be more attached to their original position. The participants are also able to educate not just themselves, but others as well by means of exchanging information, sharing values and experiences, and influencing others by means of convincing points and arguments. In the end, people with varying viewpoints arrive at a joint solution by finding common ground and making a decision for the public good. Case Example 1Slavery or Freedom Forever?  [5][6]A recent forum was held on June 18, 2010 in Athens, Georgia. A small group of people and participants from the University of Georgia gathered to deliberate on questions of historical slavery and how past and present values continue to shape the history of slavery. The group used an issue guide that raised the three approaches people from 1854 dealt with contending with the issue of slavery and its future in this country. The three approaches were: 
 1. Remembering our ideals, judging slavery from a moral standpoint, and working towards ending slavery, 
 2. Treating slavery as a political problem to solve and affirming individual choice by giving local settlers the right to decide the national status of slavery, 
 3. Protecting the prosperity of the country by making decisions on slavery based on the economic well-being of the society. 
 The first approach led the group to discuss deeply held beliefs and values. They focused on the religious bases that people from 1854 adopted for this approach. The second approach led to a discussion about a divisive country having free and slave states. People recognized that taking a political approach to slavery makes it so the issue is inherent to self-interest and corruption. The third approach led to the discussion of economic growth as a result of slavery versus moral interests. Upon reflection, many thought that the first approach appealed to them best, reasoning that moral judgments are important in the decision making process. They rejected political and economic progress if it meant compromising their beliefs and values. Case Example 2Weighing the Options: How can we encourage healthy weights among America’s youth?  [7]Obesity is becoming a larger problem every year as the number of children who are overweight has become greater over time. Children who experience problems with their weight often have long term health and emotional problems that ultimately cause greater public issues and costs. Every year obesity causes over 75 billion dollars of medical expense in the US alone. The purpose of the forum is to ultimately work together to better understand the problem and its consequences. It considers the benefits and drawbacks of different approaches to the problem; identify actions likely to make a positive difference and are doable in terms of time, resources, and public will. The participants examine the roles of government, schools, businesses, and civic and religious groups, as well as our responsibility as individuals; and explore potential next steps. 
 The three approaches for this forum are: 1. Expect personal responsibility for fitness 2. Invest in overall child well-being 3. Change our culture to encourage fitness 
 The first approach focuses on the problem being that children do not have enough education or supervision to understand what it means to be healthy. The second approach focuses on the concern of a child’s weight being the primary concern, rather than being concerned with other issues of the child’s well being. Lastly, the third approach focuses on changing the way we live our everyday lives with the help of advertisers by promoting healthier options. Each of the approaches have an emphasis on different concerns or solutions that may help this issue. The participants discuss and deliberate a variety of opinions and elaborate on pros and cons for each approach. They do all of these steps while maintaining the goal of keeping an open mind to all options before coming to an individual conclusion. After each approach is given ample time for discussion and exchange of viewpoints a final decision is made.

 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 With the right structure, facilitator, and participants the NIF is a very successful method for deliberation and discussion on important public policy issues. It is an organized way to not only hear other viewpoints and solutions, but also a platform to express personal views . The main point of the process is to keep an open perspective and opinion until all of the seen solutions and choices have been thoroughly discussed and understood. It is a step by step process that still has a very natural flow. 
 Although this is a great method for deliberative discussions on pressing issues, the results rarely bring an immediate change. The main point, however, is to educate and involve the public in order to make decisions on issues that affect the public. When discussing global and national issues in a small town setting it does limit the leverage and opportunity for change. However, its theory of change appears to be that it is changing systems and thinking on a small scale which over time will ultimately affect decisions made on a larger scale as smaller towns shift their focus and tactics. The NIF is a great opportunity for everyday citizens to get involved and participate in deliberative methods, but they also run the risk of limiting solutions and discussions if the group is not diverse enough to bring a variety of opinions and experiences. Commonly, people associate with and exchange information with people who have shared views, which can pose a problem if people are trying to develop unbiased solutions for the public rather than a segment of the population. 
 The following are possible impacts of NIF on participants, (Melville, Willingham, Dedrick, 2005)  [8]1. Participation in NIF forums heightens interest in specific issues and in public affair and leads to higher levels of public engagement. 
 2. Participation in NIF forums broadens the outlook of participants. 
 3. As a result of participating in forums, individuals come to experience themselves in different ways, and they learn new ways of taking part in groups. 
 4. Participation in NIF forums enhances people’s sense of themselves as political actors who can make a difference in their communities. 
 5. People construe their self-interest more broadly as a result of taking part in deliberative conversations. 
 6. Deliberation helps people move beyond superficial preferences to considered public judgment.

Though its forms differ greatly between locations where it is implemented, the end goals of parliamentary procedure are the same, including equal speaking opportunity for all members and to maintain orderly, accepted procedure. Parliamentary procedure attempts to ensure civil  deliberation  among members of an entity by guaranteeing equal rights and opportunities to those involved. Another key feature of parliamentary procedure, as described in Mason’s Manual, a handbook for one version of parliamentary procedure commonly seen in the United States, is that any entity that uses parliamentary procedure allow its members the chance to debate the question at hand, and that any debate be resolved by democratic voting. [1]  Two of the main forms of parliamentary procedure are based on books — the one most commonly seen in the United States is based on Mason’s Manual, which focuses on ensuring democratic voting, as well as equal access and privileges to all those involved. Mason’s Manual was written specifically to help legislative bodies run more smoothly, with its egalitarian, democratic framework for parliamentary procedure. [2]  Robert’s Rules of Order  was the first set of published rules of parliamentary procedure published in book form. Published in 1876, it laid the groundwork for what has since become modern parliamentary procedure. Robert’s Rules of Order, unlike Mason’s Manual, was not intended for governmental use, rather for other societal entities and groups. Both forms strive to protect all voices in the group, even those which have little to no support. Robert's Rules of Order and Mason's Manual are both highly complex systems, with Mason's Manual being the more stringent as it was designed for matters of legislative significance. Mason's Manual has specific provisions in it which relate directly to certain governmental offices, so as to avoid any possible confusion on the floor. [3]  Origins and Development  Parliamentary procedure is used in numerous governments, including but not limited to the United States, the United Kingdom, Iceland, Australia, Finland, Russia, Spain, and Poland. [8] In these cases (and many others), parliaments are used to deliberate on the merits of pieces of legislation, as well as discuss matters that may need to be made into legislation.  The history of parliamentary procedure as it is known today dates back to the 18th century in the United Kingdom, though parliamentary procedure itself is said to date back to ancient Greece. The United Kingdom’s parliamentary laws crossed the sea when its citizens did, and thus were implemented in the government of the United States. Thomas Jefferson made some revisions to the British laws in what he called Jefferson’s Manual, a book on parliamentary procedure written specifically for the United States at the turn of the 19th century. [9] In the late 19th century, Robert’s Rules of Order was written, and by the early 20th century, it had become the definitive guide for parliamentary procedure. When Mason’s Manual was written in 1950, states began adopting it, seeing as it was specifically tailored to the needs of legislative bodies. Currently, different states use different versions of parliamentary procedure based on what has been adopted, though the majority use Mason’s Manual.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Participant selection is normally done through election or nomination, as is the case with parliamentary governments, but this holds true even in the case of high school clubs. Normally those already familiar with parliamentary procedure are selected, which makes the transition into their new role more fluid for the whole group.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Parliamentary procedure is generally communally agreed upon by the members of a deliberative entity, and is thus established and enacted as the rules governing that group's deliberative procedure. Various groups approach this in different ways, hence the vast array of different forms of deliberation out there that fall under ""parliamentary procedure."" Most forms require a facilitator of some sort, such as a debate moderator, to ensure the maintenance of order and procedure within the group. The facilitator serves to rein in the discussion if it gets out of hand, maintain orderly voting, and sometimes determine the order of speakers if there is confusion.  Parliamentary procedure also requires that there be sufficient advance notice of a meeting given to all members in order for it to be considered legitimate. This prevents the majority group from having a meeting without the presence of minority voices. [4]QuorumParliamentary procedure is most often used by governing entities, and elected representatives are generally the ones who partake in such  deliberation . In order for a hearing to be held, there must be a quorum, or sufficient numbers, in attendance. If quorum is not met, the hearing is adjourned. In the United States, quorum is a simple majority of those expected to be in attendance. A simple majority of votes is the requirement to make a decision, though in some places these numbers are changed based on circumstances.SpeakingOne of the core values of parliamentary procedure is to ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to speak, regardless of whether they are in the majority or minority. This was first developed in  Robert’s Rules of Order , for the sake of both guaranteeing the rights of the majority and protecting the rights of the minority. [5] All forms of parliamentary procedure strive to ensure equality among all participants, regardless of majority or minority status. Speakers take turns giving speeches and addressing questions from other participants.MotionsA motion is an action suggested by a member of the body. In order for a motion to be considered, it must be seconded by another member. At this point, the body must vote whether to approve the motion or reject it. Normally motions relate to postponing the legislation or calling the body to vote. Motions include: the motion to table, which means to set aside the topic at hand and move to another topic; a motion to commit, which means to refer a motion to a smaller committee it would be fitting for; a motion to previous question, which calls for an immediate vote and an end to deliberation; and a motion of no confidence, used to express dissent toward or a lack of faith in those in power. Any member can propose a motion at any time. [6]VotingAfter everyone who wanted to speak has gotten the chance to, there is normally a motion to vote. Voting can be spoken (yea or nay) en masse, written in ballot form, conducted by counting raised hands, or each member of the body will be individually asked his or her vote, depending on the group and its bylaws. Votes are then tallied if needed, and the winner is announced after all votes have been counted. Each individual’s vote is equal, as the system is democratic. In some organizations, the facilitator, often a chairperson of some sort, is granted the power to break ties.

Citizen Advisory Boards add to the deliberative quality of a democracy by involving everyday citizens in political processes that help shape policies.,0,2010-06-04,2020-06-28,164,Jcourter,https://participedia.net/user/164,417734,"""Jaskiran Gakhal Participedia Team""",https://participedia.net/user/417734,en,0,facetoface,collaborate,limited,election,polarized,high,longterm, collaborative, evaluation,small,,,neighbourhood, city/town, metropolitan,discussion, formal, ask,idea, general, voting,majoritarian, unanimous,develop, make,," Problems and Purpose  Citizen Advisory Boards are a method for engaging local citizens in deliberative processes by allowing them to examine relevant issues in depth. The responsibilities of a Citizen Advisory Board include but are not limited to “the study of critical issues, taking public testimony, performing independent research, and reviewing staff reports and recommendations [which prepares] the advisory body to discuss, analyze, formulate, and forward well-developed, thoughtful recommendations to the legislative body.”[1] While there are many different way to organize a Citizen Advisory Board, the majority are comprised of small groups of volunteers that are interested in getting involved in both local politics and the issues facing their community.[2]  Origins and Development  Due to the local nature of Citizen Advisory Boards, it is difficult to determine when the first of these boards occurred. At this time, the earliest Citizen Advisory Board appears to be the 15-member Historical Affairs and Landmark Review Board in Arlington, Virginia which was established in 1976.[3] Since then there have been thousands of Citizen Advisory Boards created across the United States from Kirkland, Washington to Dunedin, Florida.[4]  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Both recruitment and selection for citizen advisory board members is generally expected to be an open and fair process for interested citizens.[5] According to the Municipal Research and Services Center of Washington, screening of volunteers is focused on seeking out individuals “with a strong interest and a willingness to contribute the necessary hours” as well as specific experience or expertise if required for the purposes of that specific board.[6] Applicants are often asked why they are interested in serving on the specific board they are applying for as well as what personal and professional experience they can offer.[7] Sometimes, questions regarding “residency and conflict of interest” are asked and Tacoma, Washington asks about ethnicity in pursuit of “racial balance on its boards.”[8] The Municipal Research and Services Center of Washington suggests that volunteer’s reasons for participation vary widely, with some of the most common including “feeling that they can help shape policy; looking for a change of pace or to add variety to their life; fulfilling a civic duty; desiring to become involved and give something back to the community.”[9]Media used to publicize board member positions are often advertised in the area’s local newspapers, press releases, local community organizations and libraries, as well as on the Internet.[10] The selection process varies by locale as well, with some processes being more simple than others.[11] According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency Participation Guide, “boards range from 12 to 25 persons in size” ideally.[12]  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Citizen Advisory Boards are most frequently created by city governments, but there are instances where they are created at the state level in order to assist the state with issues that are best dealt with at a more local level.[13] One of the key distinctions between boards is their decision making capacity. Some boards operate in a strictly advisory capacity while others hold administrative powers that allow them to make policy decisions.[14] It is also important to keep in mind that cities and states are not limited to having just one Citizen Advisory Board. A city or state may have a number of Citizen Advisory boards in order to receive input on a number of different topics.[15] “The method for creating them, by ordinance, resolution, or motion, tends to vary from one jurisdiction to another.”[16] In most cases, members of the board are appointed by the mayor.[17] While there is no ideal number for a Citizen Advisory Board, it is important that the group is large enough to have a broad range of ideas while remaining small enough that it is easy to manage.[18][19]  After establishing the board, the responsibilities of the board must be clearly defined.[20] Without clearly defined responsibilities the board is likely to lose focus on the assigned task and as a result will be less effective.[21] Additionally, there must be support staff provided in order to assist with the administrative elements of the operation of the board.[22] Once the responsibilities have been assigned, a support staff has been put in place and an orientation explaining the legalities involved has taken place the board can begin to operate.[23]  After the board has been formed, procedural guidelines must be established.[24] Some governments are less restrictive in terms of how their Citizen Advisory Boards operate and allow them to establish their own procedures as long as they are in accordance with the rules that have established the board in the first place.[25] Other governments are stricter and require that their boards follow parliamentary procedure.[26] Some feel that following parliamentary procedure rules enable the board to operate more efficiently while others feel that it creates a less comfortable environment which can stifle discussion.[27] Typically, “boards will designate a chairperson to run meetings, set agendas, and provide general leadership [with] advisory boards elect[ing] their own officers, [in some jurisdictions while] iin others, the board chair or officers are appointed.”[28]  The final piece of the process is the Citizen Advisory Board reporting out to the governing body.[29] This is essentially the final product that the board was created for in the first place. Advisory boards typically “meet once per month” for about 12 to 18 months in order to discuss issues in sufficient depth and develop recommendations; depending on the complexity of the specific issues, they can take longer than 18 months.[30] According to the Municipal Research and Services Center of Washington , “ provisions for periodic reporting of boards and commissions to the governing body provide a tool for oversight and policy evaluation, and can be used to enhance communications with constituents.”[31]  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Citizen advisory boards serve a number of purposes including allowing “for an in-depth examination of issues.”[32] As Citizen Advisory Boards are often created to address a specific issue, they are able to perform a more in-depth analysis of the issue than the typical local government may be able to perform.[33] As such, Citizen Advisory Boards are a useful resource for local governments to use when tackling very specific local issues. Citizen advisory boards also provide a “communication channel between elected officials and the community.”[34] By involving volunteer citizens in the process, Citizen Advisory Boards can act as a conduit to communicate the thoughts and ideas held by the community members to their local government officials.[35]  According to the Florida League of Cities (FLC), the boards “bring a broad range of ideas and expertise to public decision making.”[36] Due to their composition of people from the local community, they are often able to represent the diverse ideas and expertise that exist within the community.[37] Doing so further enhances the deliberative nature of the local government. The FLC also writes that the boards offer assistance for conflict resolution.[38] Citizen Advisory Boards are equipped to be able to deal with conflict as they are able to utilize the aforementioned broad range of ideas and expertise to deliberate through such conflicts in order to reach a well-reasoned resolution. Another purpose that the Citizen Advisory Boards serve is offering leadership training.[39] Citizen Advisory Boards can be used as a way for citizens to get their first experience in politics and government. This affords citizens the opportunity to experience political life without having to run for office.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Citizen Advisory Boards have become a staple of democracy nationwide.[40] Case studies involving Citizen Advisory Boards have taken place throughout the US, including in  Fernald, Ohio  and  Clearwater, Florida . They increase the deliberativeness of governments by engaging volunteer citizens and allowing them to be part of the political and governmental processes that occur in their local community.[41] This serves to “overcome citizen apathy and disinterest by crafting lively and engaging participation programs.”[42] Ultimately, if local governments are able to clearly communicate the purpose of a Citizen Advisory Board in addition to finding the right people and providing them with training, these boards can be a valuable process in a deliberative democracy.  Berry et al. examined citizen boards from five different cities, finding that they “were effective in getting citizens issues addressed” and providing participants with a stronger sense of community, trust in public officials, and confidence in local government.[43] Furthermore, a study by Marlene Rebori indicated that the recommendations from citizen advisory boards were successful in influencing local decision-makers.[44] Similarly, Dr. Lucie Laurian finds that board members “feel well informed about community concerns” and able to express such concerns to the relevant agencies.[45]  However, in her examination of five case studies, Laurian found that public input did “not significantly influence agency decisions.”[46] As a result, she suggested that communities systematically gather feedback in order to address this deficiency as well as increase agencies’ accountability to the input.[47] Additionally, Laurian suggests that citizen advisory boards are “limited by the lack of public awareness of participatory opportunities.”[48] Therefore, she recommends greater public outreach in order to ensure the participatory process is meaningful.[49]  See AlsoFernald Citizens Advisory Board   References  [1] “Local Government Citizen Advisory Boards Examples, options, and model practices for the effective and efficient use of advisory boards by local governments,”  Municipal Research and Services Center of Washington,  last modified August 2008,  http://mrsc.org/getmedia/72061479-9ba8-48b4-ab1f-cfa62cf7d4f1/Local-Government-Citizen-Advistory-Boards.pdf.aspx?ext=.pdf , 6.

It allows the student participants to educate themselves about a variety of governance-related topics and culminates in a series of simulated congressional hearings, with the most developed presenters proceeding to the state and national level competitions. The primary focus of the program is the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights, although the topics range from the abstract philosophical underpinnings of government to concrete proposals for government environmental policy. The method repeats yearly and is designed to take a significant portion of a school year, and the entirety of one for the national competitors.  A related method is  Model United Nations .  We the People was created in response to decades of decline in civic knowledge and participation. The method's originating entity, the Center for Civic Education, makes the program’s goals explicit: “to promote civic competence and responsibility among the nation’s elementary and secondary students.”[1] The intent is to expand knowledge about and encourage enlightened understanding of civic issues within the country, and by extension to increase public participation.  Origins and Development  We the People originates from a study conducted at the University of California, Los Angeles, beginning in the 1960’s and included more than 250,000 matriculated college students from around the country. The study compiled evidence from 30 years of data showing that in 1998, “only 26% of freshmen think that keeping up with politics is important, down from 58% in 1966. Only 14% say they frequently discuss politics, down from 30%”.[1] Subsequent studies also found that “35% of high school seniors were considered to have a ‘below-basic’ understanding of civic education or “near total civic ignorance.”[2] Furthermore, the study found that another 39% were only at the “basic” level, indicating a deeply systemic problem in civic participation and knowledge.  The organizing entity behind We the People is the Center for Civic Education, a civic organization created in 1964 as a committee at the University of California, Los Angeles.[4] In 1981, the organization transformed into a non-profit entity.[4] The We the People program was first implemented in 1987 by the Center for Civic Education and has continued yearly with funding from the United States Department of Education.[5]  Participant Recruitment and Selection  The program, by being academically grounded, is limited to students. Within participating schools, the method of participant selection varies. At some, it is a voluntary club activity, while in others an optional substitution for a mandatory civics class, and at others is restricted to those who have taken a year-long prerequisite course. Given that there is a minimum of three members in each unit, at least 18 students are usually required, although some schools have students in multiple units, lowering the theoretical requirement to 3 total individuals. There is no explicit upper bound on the number of participants from each school, although having seven or more members in each group will make it difficult to use the time available effectively.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  What distinguishes We the People as a deliberative process rather than as a glorified class is the method of case development. Each group is meant to specialize in a broad topic, such as US case law or the developmental process of the Constitution, and for each level of competition, they are given three questions, with a number of subtopics, around which they need to develop a response. The teacher, unlike in a normal class, is not the primary source of information beyond the initial several classes where general background knowledge is taught and units are usually selected. After those classes, the groups must work to create a timed written response to be presented at the simulated hearing, and more importantly to respond to follow-up questions that are not known prior. The method for constructing the responses is determined by the participants, but must necessarily include a significant degree of  consensus -seeking to maintain a coherent group.  The hearings themselves are conducted by a variety of individuals, frequently including judges, politicians, and other legal professionals. They will select one of the questions assigned to each group to be presented and will then ask impromptu follow-up questions. This requires successful groups to be widely self-educated on each topic to deal with potentially obscure questions, as well as to have a significant depth of knowledge so that each question can be thoroughly responded to. Neither the pre-assigned questions nor the hearing questions are intended to have correct responses, but rather to require the participants and groups to take and defend a stance. They are thus not serving as what would be technical experts in a real hearing, but as the subjects of the hearing or as representatives for the subjects.  In addition to interacting with public officials and legal professionals during the competitive stage, many teams use experts in constitutionally related issues as everyday class resources. For example, a team may invite a Constitutional lawyer into their classroom to collaborate with them on questions that require more research or they may discuss ways to increase civic engagement with experienced politicians across that region. During tournaments, teams frequently visit prominent public leaders as a way to both contact people in power about issues they are passionate about as well as to consult them about issues they have been researching. These experiences give participants insight into the inner workings of government agencies and ability to contact political leaders in an effort to understand policy and actively engage with the government. This contact provides a mechanism for students to become more passionate about the issues and increasingly motivated to be responsible civic participants.  Program Structure  The structure can be broken down into two parts which enhance the deliberative nature of the program; the Unit structure and the actual structure of the competition.UnitsThe Center for Civic Education has broken down the competition into 6 units, comprised of 3 to 6 people. Each unit focuses on a relatively narrow range of topics, which allows them to unlock more meaningful aspects of the Constitution. In order to be successful, participants must look past the obvious questions of the Constitution and into the deeper meaning and policy implications it has on the real world. Because participants work in groups of 4 or 5 and focus on specific portions of the Constitution they are able to discusses their chosen topics with greater insight, thereby instilling a stronger sense of civic knowledge and duty. The Unit topics break down accordingly[6]:Historical and Philosophical Foundations of our County’s Ideas about Constitutional Government  Creation of the Constitution  Expansion of Rights since the Ratification of the Constitution in 1788  Organization of the National Government  Meanings of the Various Rights Guaranteed in the Bill of Rights  Roles of Citizens in American DemocracyBecause the Units are discussing nebulous topics, there is a great deal of influence, discourse, compromise, and persuasion which occurs through their discourse. This factor alone is a major contributor in strengthening the deliberative nature of this program. A study conducted by the Council for Basic Education in 1994 found that after competing in We the People;  “exhibit more political tolerance in a number of ways, including (1) placing fewer restrictions on the press, speech and advocacy of radical or unorthodox ideas (2) more willingness to grant freedom of assembly to groups with diverse opinions (3) placing fewer restrictions on due process and (4) displaying a willingness to grant others a wide latitude of speech and act politically.” [7]  The structure of these units adheres to the maxims of an ideal analytic process by encouraging students to engage in a back and forth dialogue in a manner which maintains a healthy team dynamic as outlined by communications professor Dr. John Gastil. [8] The groups brainstorm a series of answers to the given questions according to a strong information base in order to maximize the overall group success. The information found by one group is almost always applicable to the research of other groups, encouraging cross-unit collaboration. Current events play a significant role in the formation of the group’s answers, so there is a constant need to remain updated on contemporary political and legislative changes. Personal experiences also play a key role in the group’s  deliberation  as they can incorporate those experiences into evidence to support their conclusion. Furthermore, those conclusions must represent the comprehensive advocacies of all group members, as they will need to support them during the competition.CompetitionAfter months of preparation, studying, and discussion, participants travel to a competition which includes students from other high schools around the State. The students are given 3 potential questions before the competition, which they have written speeches for, and are told which question they will be discussing when the judges enter the room. A panel of 3 judges questions the students, but in a manner which is to probe them to think deeper about their positions and defend them, truly encouraging the deliberative process. Because participants have no knowledge of the specific questions, or style of questions the judges will ask, they must think of their feet and be able to recall and apply relevant information quickly. The judges then score the responses based on the completeness of their answers, as well as the group’s support for their claims. Because the competition is essentially a conversation between the judges and participants, there is no fear of agreeing with the judges personal ideologies, but rather supporting the group’s personal advocacies. The structure of these groups models the ideal social deliberative process, also outlined by Dr. Gastil, which includes such maxims as distribution of speaking times, mutual comprehension, and respect for all participants view points;[8] all are factors in the overall score the group will receive.Example QuestionsThe following are examples of the types of questions a Unit may receive, which represents the overall thesis of their argument, and the topic they would prepare research to support.  Unit One: What Are the Philosophical and Historical Foundations of the American Political System?  1. How did both classical republicans and the natural rights philosophers influence the Founders’ views about government?What are the essential differences between classical republicanism and natural rights philosophy?  Why do both classical republicans and natural rights philosophers stress the need for education and preparation for citizenship?2. What are the fundamental characteristics of a constitutional government?In what ways does constitutional government mean limited government?  Describe at least three provisions of the Constitution that provide a means of preventing the abuse or misuse of governmental power. Explain how these provisions work in our system of government today.3. What effect did colonial experiences have on the Founders’ views about rights and government?In what ways were eighteenth-century American and British societies similar or dissimilar in terms of the rights of individual liberty, equality of opportunity, and property?  How did early state constitutions reflect colonial experiences as well as the ideas of classical republicanism and the natural rights philosophy?This type of questioning is essential in promoting the deliberative process because questions cannot be answered simply. It incorporates a necessity to weigh the pros and cons of any given conclusion. The sub-questions create a broader range of analysis, forcing participants to ‘think outside the box’ and gain an understanding of that the judges will be looking for.  The competition represents an interesting hybrid between formal, mediated discussion and informal, casual conversation which maximizes the importance of participant knowledge and communication skills to promote a truly deliberative environment.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  The main outcome from the We the People... program is increased civic engagement. Because one of the essential components involves being engaged in critical analysis of media and political actions, an active citizenry is inherent in the process of education that We the People fosters. In an exit study of student participants in the 2010 We the People competition, 63% of students reported that either they had or were planning on contacting an elected official whereas only 23% of non-We the People students reported that they were planning on contacting an elected official.[9] Professor Richard Brody of Stanford University explains ”the We the People... program is effective in promoting political tolerance because students in the program become more interested in politics, feel more politically effective, and perceive fewer limits in their own political freedom.”[10] Comparatively, other nations that experience a significant rift between civic culture and government politics form a “patron-client” atmosphere.[11] In response to this, nations that experience the divide between the two sects of governance and wish to represent true democracy can create civic programs similar to what the We the People program strives to achieve.[12]  While legal adults may have few opportunities to engage with government and civic issues, pre-voting-age students have even fewer. We the People, though limited in its direct influence on government, provides students with a rare opportunity to engage with and learn about issues and to interact with government officials and professionals in the mock hearings. Through crafting their groups’ positions on the issues they must themselves develop their own political stances in collaboration with other students. This has lead to We the People students being significantly more knowledgeable about government, rights, and law, and to be more civically active.[13]  In addition to fostering more active citizenship in American Democracy, the openly deliberative structure of the We the People... classroom fosters a unique educational experience. A pilot test of the We the People... curriculum revealed  “statistically significant differences between those students who used We the People and those students who used a different civics curriculum and between students enrolled in AP classes and students in regular classes...the hypothesis that participating in We the People significantly adds to student performance over and above the role of class placement is confirmed.”[14]  This data implies an educational difference in civics based on the deliberative and collaborative process provided by the program.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The focus on ensuring enlightened understanding among the participants has both positive and negative impacts. The process does result in greater civic awareness and action by participating students; however, it does not, despite frequent involvement by government officials, offer any direct participatory role by the students in the formation of policy. To some extent this is understandable, given that most participants are not legal adults and are thus traditionally excluded from public decision-making processes. However, the extent of the knowledge gained over the course of the program is not trivial, leaving the participants uniquely qualified to address a number of complex issues. The number of participants available might thus constitute an untapped pool for more direct civic engagement by the program, or by related efforts.  Locating this program within the school system similarly provides both positive and negative impacts. It sharply limits the accessibility of the program to the general public, but allows for a significantly greater commitment then most would be able to make outside of a class setting. While this should be acknowledged, it does not appear to be a significant detriment considering the other programs managed by the Center for Civic Education and other groups in which adults can participate, and indeed are often the only allowed participants.  The largest cause for concern within the We the People program is the lack of general accessibility and funding. The United States Department of Education contributes a limited number of free materials to each congressional district, which limits the number of schools that can participate and thus the overall national participation in the program.[15] Limited accessibility of the We the People... program is troublesome for the deliberative goal of the program. Limited access to materials and funding has historically drawn affluent schools into the program and rejected schools that are not well funded or in poverty-stricken neighborhoods. This lack of representation limits the political perspectives that can be brought into the competition.  Another criticism of the function that We the People... provides is of the competitive nature of the class and activity. The competition portion of the program can override the educational and deliberative aspect of creating educational materials. The incentive to win in competition can motivate students to tailor their responses in a way to create answers that they believe will convince the judges rather than reflect their own beliefs. This motivation also leads students to stray from the activity’s mission of applying personal experiences and unintentionally encourages overemphasis on scholarly sources that will create an aura of scholarship within a particular group’s answers.  Division of labor within groups can also provide a detrimental impact on the deliberation within We the People: by forcing each group to focus on one portion of the competition rather than engage in a holistic constitutional debate, each group is led to specialize in some aspect of the Constitution, while being educationally anemic on others. For example, a member of Unit 1 may be extremely proficient on philosophical underpinnings of the Constitution and authors such as John Locke or Jean-Jacque Rousseau but may have nominal background on judicial intervention during the civil rights movement.  One important aspect of the We the People... lesson plan is an emphasis on group collaboration and self-direction. The hands-off approach that is asked for teachers to take while in this program creates an opportunity for conflict within groups. Personal attitudes as well as inappropriate skill-sets both contribute to the possibility that some students will not be effective in their use of the process of social deliberation. Teachers must also be constantly aware of the opportunity to neglect using in-class opportunities wisely. This detracts from deliberation within groups because the lack of properly moderating group interaction creates an opportunity for dominant voices to control group views and create a spiral of silence within individual groups.Future of the ProgramFunding has been a consistent problem of the We the People... program. Despite its success nationwide, there has never been a stable funding source other than Congressional appropriations and private donations. This mechanism is problematic because it does not ensure a consistent income throughout tough economic times, which places We the People... in jeopardy of discontinuation. This problem exacerbates the lack of accessibility as well as the lack of expansion efforts to more schools nationwide. Unless the program secures some sort of reliable funding source, the goals of civic engagement and responsibility may not be fully realized.  In response, local school boards and commercial organizations individually have taken it upon themselves to contribute to students’ educations by funding trips to competitions as well as educational materials necessary for participation in the program. While the program boasts 28 million students since inception,[15] individual school participation has not increased dramatically, largely due to funding limitations as well as a lack of knowledge of the program. Illustrating the significance of the program past college applications and transcript-building could increase the deliberative aspect of the program and include students that would not have previously considered participating in the program.SupportersThe We the People... program is mainly supported by the Center for Civic Education, American Heritage Foundation, Pew Charitable Trusts, as well as other public-policy oriented organizations. The primary goal for many of the contributors to this organization is to promote civic responsibility and education rather than promoting any particular partisan goals or ideology. The strong interest in this program represents the desire for greater  civic education  in general rather than the fulfillment of particular interests, highlighting a desire to promote civic participation over self-interested advocacy. This display of altruism is unique to this particular area of education because there is seemingly no long-term profit motive other than to improve and preserve the American political landscape for the future.

 Problems and Purpose 
 An End to End (E2E) Auditable Voting System enables a voter to verify that their vote has been correctly recorded and tallied, without anyone else being able to find out exactly they voted. Verifiable voting systems were originally designed in paper-based ballot systems, but most recently  platforms  enabling E2E voting use encryption technology to try and ensure both the integrity of an election whilst maintaining voter privacy [1].

An open meeting place for reflective thinking, democratic debate of ideas, formulation of proposals, free exchange of experiences and interlinking for effective action, by groups and movements of civil society that are opposed to neoliberalism and to domination of the world by capital and any form of imperialism, and are committed to building a planetary society directed towards fruitful relationships among Humankind and between it and the Earth. [1]  Although the Social Forum method began in Porto Alegre as the World Social Forum, it has now been diffused to local, regional, and national forum occurrences, each a repeated, networked and interconnected gathering of advocates for social change and justice that are seeking new communicative methods, collective action means, and engaged global politics.[2] A uniting theme is to explore the impact at the local, regional, and national level of the pervasive form of economic globalization ('neoliberalism') that emphasizes the interests of capital rather than human relationships in international economic decision-making. On grounds of social justice, Forum participants largely oppose the neoliberal free market principles of privatization, fiscal austerity, reduced trade barriers and cuts in basic subsidies promoted by global financial and political institutions to encourage capital expansion. The Social Forum process is an important tool for creating and deepening transnational dialogue between individuals, non-governmental organizations and social movement networks to identify shared problems and explore diverse possible types of alternative economic and political organization. Building alternatives at Social Forums must above all respect local autonomy and participation in international economic and political decision-making, especially given the profound effects of these decisions at all levels of society. The sharing of experiences of the impact of neoliberal globalization upon marginalized and disempowered groups is an important pedagogical goal of the Social Forums, ideally creating a broad and more inclusive analysis of the impact of economic globalization.  Marlies Glasius further defines the notion of Social Forums as a meeting of 'civil society' to be a convergence of ""people organizing to influence their world,"" arguing that the new phenomenon of Social Forums holds significant potential for global democracy because it mines the creative tension between two different strains of thought about civil society: Habermas's conception of civil society as a locus of deliberation versus Gramsci's conception of civil society as a locus of struggle.[3] Indeed, the many contradictions and uncertainties internal to the Forum process are defined by a tension between those who what it to be a space of  deliberation  and those who want it to be a political actor or force for change in its own right. The slogan of the Social Forum, 'Another World is Possible,' is sought by global civil society actors by both staging alternative debates and by proposing alternative policies to influence existing institutions, but also through the prefigurative creation of alternative participatory political organization through grassroots struggle. Taking as its guiding principle that democratic governance requires participation, the Social Forum seeks a new model of global governance and civil society.  As the Social Forum process approaches its first decade in existence, it is arguably the characteristic form of grassroots civil society organizing of the first decade of this century. Social Forums are a more open, inclusive and participatory complement within global civil society to the large and highly institutionalized network of international NGOs. The popularity of the Social Forum is probably due to their low organizing costs and inherent flexibility and mobility, not to mention the ability of Social Forums to combine the advantages of face-to-face interactions in terms of community-building and leadership with the efficiency of web-based organizing in terms of information dissemination and management. [3]  Origins and Development  The history of the Social Forum process shares much with the history of the 'anti-globalization moment', or, renamed by subsequent World Social Forum discussions, the Global Justice and Solidarity Movement. The idea for the World Social Forum (WSF) as a worldwide civil society event was initially proposed by Oded Grajew, the coordinator of the Brazilian Business Association for Citizenship (CIVES), and Francisco Whitaker of the Brazilian Justice and Peace Commission (CBJP) to Bernard Cassen, President of the Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions for the Aid of Citizens (ATTAC) and Director of the Le Monde Diplomatique, in February 2000. The Forum was planned to be held in the global South, particularly Porto Alegre, a city that could offer organizational resources through the ruling Worker's Party (PT) and political inspiration given its noted model of  participatory budgets .[4]The name 'World Social Forum' and the coincident dates of the event were chosen to evoke opposition to the annual World Economic Forum held in Davos, Switzerland [i]. Preceding mass mobilizations, including Seattle 1999, brought to the world stage the method of international  protest  as a new form of political participation in the global justice movement, of nonviolent disruption with a lack of formal leadership and the prominence of networked affinity groups. Although global protests are critical venues of learning, coalition-building, communication and action, they alone were seen as insufficient, since they articulate largely negative sentiment.[2] What was needed was a venue appropriate to formulating and proposing concrete alternatives.  Building from previous convergence processes, including Zapatista Encounters in Chiapas and Spain and  United Nations  (UN) civil society forums, the WSF was envisioned to fill this void. The Zapatista movement is often cited as a key source of inspiration. The rapid and plural extent of citizen mobilization against NAFTA and FTAA in the Americas at the turn of the millennium played a deciding role in the convocation of the first WSF in Brazil in 2001, establishing the necessary ability to use the new medium of the Internet to disseminate information and organize collective action as well as a willingness to enlist the support and encourage the solidarity of diverse NGOs and social movement organizations. Dorval Brunelle has argued that the style of these new mobilizations assured that it would proliferate at all levels of social life, as the Social Forum process now does.[5]Further, the WSF was intended to build upon the activist cooperation encouraged by UN global conferences [ii], and compensate for a perceived lack of a substantial role for transnational (as well as regional, national and local) civil society organizations from NGOs within the UN system. Civil society disillusionment with the UN was deepened by the setbacks of the five-year review processes of the Summits held in 1997 and 2000.[6] There was little tangible progress on social issues because the structure of the UN privileges major countries who often refuse to address key issues. A lack of government follow-through led to calls for an alternative venue for the emergent international cooperative realm of civil society. The WSF was conceived to be this alternative venue, and as such it is an explicit recognition of the limitations of the UN both externally and internally.Finally, the women's movement also lends historical precedent to the Social Forum process. The Forum has been interpreted as a concrete example of the dissemination of feminist organizing principles that promote non-hierarchical participatory processes as well as decentralized, respectful dialogue and cooperation. The WSF was modelled after an ""encuentro,"" the region-wide feminist meetings in South America that took place throughout the eighties and nineties as a meeting organized around a collectivity of interests without hierarchy.[7]  The Brazilian Organizing Committee (BOC) was formed with eight Brazilian organizations participating including the Brazilian Labor Federation (CUT), Landless Workers Movement (MST), and six smaller organizations [iii]. The support of the Worker's Party municipal government of Porto Alegre and the state government of Rio Grande do Sul was secured in March 2001, gaining significant resources from these governments. The Charter of Principles was formulated by the Brazil Organizing Committee in April 2001, which was then modified and approved by the International Council (IC) in June 2001. The IC was created after the first WSF to oversee the global expansion of the process.[8]  More recently, the Social Forum process has undergone a geographic proliferation from centralized world meetings to local, regional and national settings, connected across diverse locales and scales of action through allegiance to the Charter of Principles. This new phenomenon has been described as ""political improvisation,"" evoking the fluid and organic nature of the Social Forum process itself.[9] Its relatively malleable structure allows innovative responses to the tensions inherent to realizing its goals, particularly the conflicts between interconnected yet diverse local and global scales of political action. These innovations attempt to simultaneously develop global transnational dialogue and expand both local and national organizing efforts. There is a need for Social Forums at all levels to help local communities relate their immediate interests and experiences to broader debates and analyses, building shared identities and understandings. In the Social Forum process, instead of being inherently oppositional, each of these levels is understood as in creative tension with one another, with each being informed by the other.[10] However, simultaneously widening global networks and empowering local communities with limited resources is a daunting task. The logistics of bringing diverse people to the central WSF cannot sideline local activism. The process has adapted to cope with this tension. For example, the 2006 'polycentric' WSF occurred simultaneously in 3 cities of the global South (Bamako, Mali, Caracas, Venezuela and Karachi, Pakistan). In 2008, the centralized world gathering in a specific place was suspended in favour of a global organization of thousands of local autonomous organizations, on or around January 26. This event was also known as the Global Call for Action. Finally, the tenth anniversary year of the WSF, 2010, will not have a single centralized event but rather is intended to happen permanently all year long with events throughout the world.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  The Forum may strive to be an open space, but it is by no means a neutral space, given that self-selected participants must adhere to a Charter that rejects neoliberalism and the militarization of globalization. The requirement to reject neoliberalism formally excludes not only those who already disagree with Social Forum participants, but also seems to encompass those who have not yet decided or remain uninformed of the pros and cons of neoliberalism. It remains a point of contention that, if the Forum is indeed restricted to only those with a defined negative position on neoliberalism, then it can hardly be considered 'open' (see Analysis and Lessons Learned).Another contentious issue is the exclusion of government representatives like political parties. According to the Charter of Principles, Social Forums must cultivate ""a plural, diversified, non-confessional, non-governmental and non-party context."" This was intended to keep the Forum a purely civil society endeavor, without opening it to being exploited by politicians for electoral gain. However, this exclusion has been enforced inconsistently and excluding parties altogether may be in fact detrimental to achieving Forum goals (see Analysis and Lessons Learned). The controversies surrounding who may and should participate in the Forum process continue to generate debate as the Forum seeks to avoid becoming either an inward-looking space for like-minded civil society organizations or a political tool of traditional electoral politics.[11]  Putting aside questions of who should participate, who does participate in the Social Forum process is also significant, since the process aims to expand participation in global politics and reduce the exclusions constructed by existing political and economic structures. These structural challenges can be daunting, especially in the case of the centralized World Social Forum. Geographic inequalities often limit the representation of global diversity at the Forum, especially given the necessity of access to time and travel resources and the varying degrees of connectivity to transnational civil society organizations. Those who would most benefit from economic and political change are often unable to attend, like women from Africa and Asia. Since there is a consistent over-representation of those who live in proximity to sites, all World Social Forums are held in the global south to facilitate participation of marginalized groups. Regional forums are also organized to be held in areas perceived to be negatively affected by economic forces or perceived in the cultural milieu (i.e. the choice of Detroit, Michigan for the 2010 USSF).  In 2005, the University of California at Riverside distributed 639 surveys to participants in 3 languages in diverse locations at the WSF in Porto Alegre. The UC Riverside survey provides an interesting snapshot of the characteristics and participation patterns of the participants. The survey found that the majority is politically active in alternative types of participation. 85% had protested at least once in the past year while 31% had protested 5 or more times. There was a balanced representation of gender but more men travelled from elsewhere to attend the Forum. Also, African and Asian women were underrepresented, and men were speakers more often.[12] Youth had a significant presence; 42% of participants were under 26 years old. The unconventional format of the WSF and its allegiance with protest groups and new social movements helps to explain its appeal for younger people, who may have replaced the traditional duty paradigm of citizenship with a more engaged paradigm of citizenship.[13] The majority were well-educated, with 61% having 16 or more years of formal education. The majority (70%) were students or middle-class intellectuals or professionals (1/3 students; 15% professors or teachers) that hold a college or university degree or associate with an academic institution. In contrast, 10% were working class, 6.7% hold service jobs and only 3.1% were unemployed, which is unexpectedly low given the high rate of unemployment in the area at the time. However, the over-representation of those with middle-class backgrounds and students reflect widespread inequalities in political participation. Even in voting and conventional politics, the working class does not participate as often. Participation by grassroots activists, community organisers and disadvantaged individuals is largely geographically determined (i.e. when in Porto Alegre, 79% are from South America, 54% of those from Brazil). Asia and Africa were seriously underrepresented; although they comprise 32% of the global population, they accounted for only 7.7% of the respondents to the survey. This demographic no doubt influenced the selection of Nairobi, Kenya as the 2007 WSF site.[2]  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The Social Forum process values diversity, and no unified voice may legitimately claim to represent either the Forum or its participants. The Charter of Principles states that:  The meetings of the World Social Forum do not deliberate on behalf of the World Social Forum as a body. No one, therefore, will be authorized, on behalf of any of the editions of the Forum, to express positions claiming to be those of all its participants. The participants in the Forum shall not be called on to take decisions as a body, whether by vote or acclamation, on declarations or proposals for action that would commit all, or the majority, of them and that propose to be taken as establishing positions of the Forum as a body. It thus does not constitute a locus of power to be disputed by the participants in its meetings, nor does it intend to constitute the only option for interrelation and action by the organizations and movements that participate in it. [1]  The often-cited metaphor of the Forum as 'open space' arguably captures the intent of this section of the Charter. The Social Forum process was initially created to be the infrastructure for groups, movements, and networks to share and build proposals and action platforms rather than as an actor in its own right with a unified program and strategy. If the 'open space' of the WSF is to be interpreted as a deliberative or discursive public space, then this deliberation cannot be understood as taking place on behalf of the Social Forum as a body. Rather, its purpose remains limited to internal contestation. Drawing from Habermas, early WSF organizers like Chico Whitaker envision the Social Forum as a convergence of civil society organizations in the public sphere that is divorced from the system of the markets and the state to allow influential opinion to develop through democratic procedures.[14][15] If the Social Forum were to become a locus of power, this would impose necessary administrative and bureaucratic efficiency mechanisms on the process that would negate its essential purpose as an inclusive democratic and deliberative space.[15]However, there is no consensus regarding the appropriate role of the Forum, whether as discursive space or political actor, and the exclusive dichotomy between the two roles has been questioned, particularly by the Porto Alegre Consensus and the Bamako Appeal. The Porto Alegre Consensus, also known as the 'G19 declaration' [iv] is a series of action strategies proposed by nineteen prominent intellectuals on June 29, 2005 at the fifth WSF. The Bamako Appeal appeared during the polycentric 2006 WSF. Like the Porto Alegre Consensus, the Bamako Appeal was drafted in closed, though somewhat larger, circumstances, including eighty prominent figures rather than nineteen. The Porto Alegre Consensus was immediately criticized as a violation of the Charter because it seeks to form a sufficient Forum  consensus  to act on the developed collective consciousness and thus implicitly seeks to unify or represent the Forum as a movement or body in itself rather than as a space. The Bamako Appeal was received with greater consideration, although the circumstances of its creation were still considered suspect (see Analysis and Lessons Learned).  Further, it should be noted that the Forum is not limited to rational discourse but is also an outlet for embodied performance and spectacle that is visually and emotionally compelling. These performances are equally valued in the Forum process as legitimate narrative devices that are unique ways of giving voice to experiences of marginalization that could not be expressed using rational discourse alone. For example, the 2004 WSF in Mumbai was attended by approximately 1300 members of the Dalit or 'untouchable' caste. The Dalits beat drums and performed traditional dances to symbolically resist the highly exclusionary spatial and bodily politics that limit their movements within Indian society. Traditionally, Dalits could not enter public spaces except for during the hottest midday period, and only after beating drums to announce their presence to members of higher castes. Appropriating the drums as a source of pride at the WSF was a celebration of freedom and inclusion that simultaneously recognized their history of oppression.[2]  Given that the rejection of neoliberal globalization is a nominal prerequisite to participate, it is not surprising that the overwhelming majority of participants at Social Forums are left of center in their political orientation. The goal of global social justice and democracy is common to most participants. Internal political and ideological tensions arise not from assessing the value of this goal in itself, but rather what global social justice and democracy should look like and what methods should be used to achieve it. For example, is positive change best achieved through negotiation within existing political and financial institutions of global governance, or must the entire system be radically restructured to make democratic decision-making possible at all? In principle, the WSF offers many opportunities for debate and the possibility of collaboration between many divergent and seemingly incommensurable groups.Jeffrey Juris outlines a helpful theoretical road map of the divergent social and ideological characteristics of various (often overlapping and fluid) participants of the Social Forum.[8] Institutional actors, operating within formal democratic structures, like political parties, unions and professional NGOs, seek reform through concrete formal participation in electoral politics and use the Social Forum to generate policy proposals to promote their implementation. Traditional leftists like Marxists or Trotskyists espouse state-centered revolutionary strategies and seek concrete reform only if it causes structural change. In contrast, network-based movements of grassroots activists are often direct action-oriented and not as concerned with state-centered radical anti-capitalism but rather decentralized and participatory forms of organization. Finally, autonomous movements like militant squatters emphasize local struggles and self-management, participate in alternative anarchist and anti-capitalist forums with networkers, and promote systemic change through direct action tactics. Radicals on the traditional left, network-based movements, and autonomous movements argue that capitalism must be abolished while reformists, usually institutional actors, maintain that it need only be regulated to achieve social justice. Time becomes an issue in the debate, with conflicting views on whether it is possible to achieve the long-term structural change that radicals want while at the same time implementing short-term reforms that can benefit the actual struggles of people today. Other debates focus on questions such as:Can reform lead to structural change, or is it merely perpetuating the status quo global economic system, making the ultimate realization of global democratic governance and social justice impossible?Can the negative effects of neoliberal globalization be ameliorated by democratic global political and economic institutions and specific reforms, or are they the necessary structural effects of the neoliberal and/or capitalist system?What is the relationship between social movement organizations and the state? Should movements focus their struggles on making gains in traditional electoral politics or at the grassroots?Is the role of civil society and social movement organizations solely one of creating influential public opinion and developing concrete proposals to be adopted by political parties, or should electoral politics be rejected in favor of grassroots organization and local self-management?Both reform and radical-minded Social Forum participants have created various specific proposals for change. Reform alternatives focus on concrete institutional improvements, exemplified by the Porto Alegre Consensus and Bamako Appeal. Radical alternatives take a prefigurative form, creating models beyond the state and market systems in autonomous spaces and youth camps that realize political vision through concrete action rather than solely political discourse. Examples include squatting in abandoned buildings and unused land in order to convert them into self-managed communities, the implementation of solidarity economies and independent media like Indymedia.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Within meeting space of the Social Forum event, the process of encounters, education, deliberation and contestation are to take precedence over achieving any concrete desired outcomes, as the benefit and strength of the Forum lies in its process of decentralized organization and networking rather than any policies claiming to represent the Forum. However, the Social Forum process has had innumerable concrete outcomes as it disseminates into the everyday actions and political consciousnesses of participants and organizations.  For example, the first World Social Forum established the Global Network of the Solidarity Socioeconomy, an initiative towards promoting 'economic democracy' or alternative networks of collective production and distribution that can allow citizens greater control over decisions affecting how they spend their time and money. The so-called 'third sector' initiative does not primarily seek profit like the public sector or policy change like the public sector, but instead seeks to build economic relationships that reinforce 'solidarity,' or cooperative social relationships that sustain vibrant and just communities. This alternative vision of economics is critical of the social effects of economic systems that unduly encourage only competitive relationships. This alternative concept has inspired many civil society initiatives that use economic mechanisms to enact social change and create effective accountability mechanisms for multinational corporations, including the expansion of fair trade practices in agricultural imports, labour protections like the anti-sweatshop campaign, and growing food sovereignty and community agriculture practices.[16]  The most frequently cited effect of the Social Forum process is its important role in the buildup to the largest international anti-war  protest  in history against the U.S.-lead war in Iraq on February 15th, 2003. The third WSF did not take an official position against the war (despite calls that it should do so), but instead provided an arena where diverse anti-war organizations from around the world could converge in order to orchestrate their upcoming mobilization. Further, the WSF was a pedagogical and deliberative space where new comprehensive analyses could be formed linking the Iraq war with neoliberal globalization. This built worldwide opinion against both neoliberalism and the war in Iraq. The Social Forum process has also facilitated numerous other  demonstrations , including the G8 summit protests.  Since the Forum has no unified agenda, some effects are unintended and contentious amongst some of the more radical participants. For example, initial Forums were instrumental in organizing Brazilian social movements and NGOs to support and help elect Lula da Silva, a former radical union leader and member of Brazil’s Workers Party, to that country’s Presidency in October of 2002. Those who are critical of political parties and wish to maintain the Forum as a meeting of civil society interpret this as an instance of the exploitation of the process by politicians as a tool for electoral gain. However, reform-minded participants are more willing to use the Forum to help elect politicians. The reform and radical factions of the Social Forum process are similarly divided regarding the increasing legitimacy of many WSF themes, like debt relief, socially-minded investment, and equitable globalization with global economic powers, including the World Economic Forum.[17] The participation of traditional political parties and governments in the Social Forum process remains a contentious issue, depending upon whether the role of civil society should be understood as primarily to influence concrete policy or rather as an alternative to inherently undemocratic organizations that seek electoral gain rather than social justice (see Analysis and Lessons Learned).ExamplesThe rapid proliferation of the Social Forum process at all levels means that this list should be taken as a sampling of notable cases and by no means exhaustive of all past or planned Social Forums.  National Social Forums have occured in numerous countries around the globe. The first United States Social Forum (USSF) took place in Atlanta in June 2007. Detroit, Michigan hosted USSF 2010 from June 22nd until the 26th. The most recent Canadian Social Forum was held in Windsor, Ontario from June 18th to the 20th, 2010.  Past and planned instances of local and thematic Social Forums are often too numerous to list and more difficult to track and document systemically because they are organized autonomously by local communities that do not necessarily need to use the Internet to publicize their organizing efforts. However, some thematic Social Forums planned around the WSF 2010 are organized around the topics of solidarity economies, early childhood and youth education, urban issues, the collective rights of peoples, alternatives to the financial crisis, community radio, labour issues, environment, migration, and food security.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  As economic globalization deepens and expands, the space for democratic participation at the international level becomes limited. The Social Forum process is a democratizing force that models many important aspects of future citizen participation in global political and economic policy decisions. Activists take it upon themselves to direct their actions and strategies at global institutions in transnational space as opposed to only directing it at their own national states.[18] Civil society groups and individuals attempt to unite their demands for a more democratic global polity, promoting the view that markets alone cannot govern, that democratic political institutions are necessary on all levels, and that governments must be both accountable and responsive to the social impact of their trade and economic policies, which should not be separated from or privileged above social policy goals. Social forums are formally autonomous from traditional government and international organizations like the UN in order to experiment with new forms of democracy on the global level [v]. In contrast to formal elections, the very process of the Social Forum is a response to the demand for more inclusive democratic decision-making on a necessarily global scale. Social Forums have emerged as a viable networked public space that transcends traditional territorially-based institutions that are inextricably bound to the borders of traditional states. This new organizational structure seeks to provide citizens with a significant space to learn about and engage in debate about the existing organization of the international economic and political system.The educational aspect of the Social Forum space is essential: participants learn about global politics, how to relate local experiences with their global precedents as well as develop a global awareness, identity, knowledge, and skills. Though it remains doubtful that the Social Forum will develop the internal will-formation mechanisms necessary to being a unified and active political entity in its own right (something of a unified or representative 'global civil society,' or 'movement of movements') it is clear that until now, the most important democratic impact of the Forum has been its ability to facilitate encounters between different groups and activists.[11] This is consistent with the concurrent creation of new democratic political culture that emphasizes networking logic rather than command logic and horizontal 'open space' organization rather than traditional hierarchical or vertical structures.[4]  Given its historical precedents in 'new' social movements, new information technology, the Zapatista solidarity activism and anti-free trade mobilization, the Social Forum process can be understood as exhibiting the same 'cultural logic of networking' that arguably creates the opportunity for more equitable participation.[19] As opposed to the 'command logic' of traditional parties and unions that require disciplined membership, unified strategy and institutionalized political representation to win their supposed struggle for hegemony, the Social Forum, much like the new social movements that helped c",1,0,0,1,0,

 Imagine delegating your vote on health issues to a trusted family physician. And that she gives all the votes delegated to her second year medical ethics professor. And by checking on your physician's web page you can see how your vote is being exercised on stem cell research, on liability insurance... And when you feel strongly about an issue, you can rescind your delegation with a click. 
 A direct vote overrules the delegated vote. It is also possible to change the vote delegation at any time.

By doing so, it is a tool for creating an increased ""culture of participation."" It also satisfies an urge among planning practitioners to envision impermanent solutions in unsure times, a form of development that allows for flexibility and change over time.  Another essential component of pop-ups are their ability to resist ""the threshold problem."" The Threshold Problem refers to the challenge that many institutions, including schools, often face in getting members of the public to enter the door of the building. This could be due to the nature of the facade itself: many institutions are located in buildings once considered suitably grand but now forbidding and uninviting. It could also be due to the unwillingness of institutions to make visitors feel welcome; however, the threshold problem can also be the result of social or cultural barriers. This might keep them from crossing the threshold to participate in the life of the institution, regardless of whether or not the institution attempts to bring them in. In all of these scenarios, the institution is shown to be not a neutral space. It is rather a space in which some participants feel comfortable, while others might feel unwelcome. It is a place to which some have access, and and to which others do not. It is these power imbalances, implicit in the location, physical form, and culture of the school, which the pop-up technique resists by subverting spatial dynamics of power.  The use of the pop-up technique in the arts and social entrepreneurship has created exciting and new dynamics of space and experience of the urban environment. Though typically used for art and commerce projects, most efforts employing the technique are designed to produce varying levels of social capital or civic discussion. Indeed, many of the participatory aspects and practices employed at these events could provide dynamic and fruitful opportunities to pursue expressly political and democratic ends. Temporary installation enables organizers and participants to experiment with different ways of seeing power and how it is manifested spatially. The practice also encourages residents and planners to imagine multiple trajectories and uses for a space, rather than considering it static because it is in a building. Initiatives that use the pop-up format serve a need for the community and, when it no longer serves that function, it ceases to exists.  By using the pop-up technique or format, project designers provide local opportunities for direct interaction with the data, skills, and ideas community members need in order to be able to be informed and successful participants in planning and political processes.  Origins and DevelopmentKnow how and why this tool/technique was developed? Help uscomplete this section!How it Works  Current projects in the field of public participation making use of the temporary, site-specific nature of the pop-up technique exist primarily in the public art and ""cultural production"" fields. Within these fields, projects fall within a (not-at-all-exhaustive) number of categories.Inserted vs. modular interventionsUsing the inserted intervention variation of the pop-up technique involves using vacant storefronts or existing buildings to hold one's event. Because they exist within the current built environment, projects that employ this technique tend to be of longer duration. The modular intervention format allows one's project or site of engagement to move over the space of a single day. Common 'modules' include trucks or other kinds of ""pods"" that are flexible and typically located in the public realm, whether in a right-of-way or a square. Other initiatives use a combined inserted-modular form of the pop-up. For example, farmers' markets and craft markets typically make use of existing spaces such as fields and parking lots but they are not permanent fixtures in the built environment landscape.Food as medium of exchangeCurrent trends in cultural practice frequently revolve around the idea of food as a form of cultural exchange or as a building block of community identity. Using food as a medium of exchange is not specific to pop-ups but events organized using the pop-up technique are often associated with food. For example, Food Trucks are a commonly-given example of pop-up food retail. Projects that adopt food as a medium of exchange can take the form of events and programming (""convivial"" practice) or commerce (food not bombs, temporary food stores).Passive-use interventionThe passive-use intervention variation of the pop-up is used for experiential projects and installations. This technique is best suited for initiatives which demand nothing but passive attention from participants. Mobile or temporary open or public spaces are a key example of this technique.Pop-up shopsRetailers often use the pop-up technique for targeted commerce - ie. the leveraging of a specific site for marketing reasons. For example, a retailer may employ the pop-up technique to move their practices near a larger events (such as a jewelry store in a vacant storefront during New York Fashion Week). Pop-up shops often serve an expressly social function, acting as a kind of “mobile party” venue.""Learning insertion""Projects dedicated to expressly educational ends may also employ the pop-up technique to 'insert learning' into various spaces. Temporary libraries, publicly installed computers, alternative pedagogy spaces, and skill-share booths, for example, would exemplify the use of this technique. Projects using this format come closest in objective and product to be classified as democratic innovations since the emphasis is on providing skills in a neutral environment that places teacher and student on an equal footing and transforms the spatial implications of education.Activist spacesLike the use of the pop-up for educational purposes, its employment by activists is also an example of this technique's use for democratic, participatory purposes. Artist  protest  tents and sheds are one example of activist spaces using the pop-up technique to directly insert resistance into a built environment of power such as a government building or prominent public square. Another activist pop-up concept is a “neutral” or “demonstration” space, where community members create alternate structures where they control dialogue and power brokers must be invited inside. Like learning insertions, these spaces destabilize spatial power dynamics in order to reframe  deliberation .  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Though inspirational as a model for mediating spatial power dynamics and creating locally-appropriate sites of learning and exchange, many pop-up projects are envisioned as public space enliveners, or as aesthetic artistic practices, do not satisfactorily achieve a social or political intent as with a true institution. Some sources of critique are:  - Urbanism and temporality are trendy. Thus, many of these projects while interesting and useful from an urban environment perspective are essentially social or aesthetic in nature, rather than transformational.  - Furthermore, many of these projects, being interesting to other urbanists doing their own similar projects and sharing similar goals, ultimately create bonding rather than bridging social capital. They reinforce existing social dynamics, perpetuating experimentation only within an “artist” class rather than in the communities they intend to engage.  - As art projects, many pop-up interventions do not have any framework for measuring success. As a result there is little emphasis on collecting or disseminating data, either about their project or to the community throughout the project. Some projects particularly in the learning and activist fields do create markers and measures of success, and doing so predicts that they will be more likely to have it.  - While many pop-up projects are extremely culturally specific, many others are not and seem only to exist because their creators imagined them. The most successful projects, on the other hand, take the spatial and cultural context of the site and project as part of the core of the project.  - Some projects create a problematic delineation between practitioners or creators, and “receivers” or participants. As a result such projects fail to capitalize on the potential for pop-up interventions to be destabilizing to the status quo.  - Consumption is not participation.Principles of the Pop-up Technique for Democratic InnovationBased on analysis and critique of current practices, a basic framework can be created for the successful employment of the pop-up technique for the implementation of democratic innovations:Passive use is not participation: input and decision making are necessary to enliven a project.  Both producers and users of these spaces ought to be engaged in making a product.  Projects should produce bonding and bridging social capital through site choice and outreach methods.  Spaces should physically or conceptually mediate power structures by creating invited or oppositional spaces.  Data collection, evaluation and dissemination are essential.  The project must have clearly articulated goals and measures of success.  Spaces that provide services or goods of use will produce higher participation yields.  Projects must be intensely context-specific: need comes first, project comes second.This conceptual framework must now be tested by experiments in pop-up democracy. These experiments could begin to provide social goods, information necessary to political participation, or groundings for dialogue between communities and power brokers in neutral environments. By focusing on project outcomes and evaluation the framework can then be evaluated and amended to maximize the potential of pop-up democracy in many contexts.  Specific areas of focus could include: what levels of complexity and polarization can this method of public participation support? What is the optimal duration and format of insertion based on context and issue addressed? Is it sufficient for these interventions to produce a ""culture of participation,"" or should they be directly focused towards decision making?

180,method,Cabildo Abierto,https://participedia.net/method/180,"Cabildo Abierto translates as ""Open Town Council."" It is a form of deliberative meeting that has used in South and Central America beginning in the 16th Century. ",0,2010-12-01,2022-07-15,232,Aaronmontenegro,https://participedia.net/user/232,421204,"""Nina Sartor""",https://participedia.net/user/421204,en,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,local,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Problems and Purpose 
 These open meetings were called by the Cabildo (translated as ""council""), the official government in towns and states. The ""Abierto"" portion of the name signifies the inclusion of the public. The Cabildo itself is an actual governing body with officials and leaders. Cabildo Abierto meetings gave the public a chance to vote on various issues that were important in their city and state. Political officials would meet with representatives of the public to come to an agreement on how to solve various issues. Cabildo Abiertos are still held periodically in South America and Central America, and are still considered effective and efficient in resolving all sorts of issues. 
 Problems--The Cabildo Abierto did have some notable problems. It was not a complete democracy, and it tended to exclude people from the lower classes. Poor Criollos and Mestizos (people of mixed descent), Indians, women and slaves were not allowed to participate in the Cabildo Abierto. Only people of pure or nearly pure Spanish Ancestry were allowed to participate in the Cabildo Abierto. In addition, the most wealthy and fit members of society were considered to be more worthy of participating in the Catildo Abierto than the working class. 
 Although there was some favoritism in choosing the members who would participate in the Cabildo Abierto, it was still seen as a major step toward Democracy in Latin America because the voice of the people was expressed to the colonizers, who reported to the official Cabildo of the colony, who in turn, reported to the King of Spain's representative in Latin America. This was seen as progress. However, the views of the rich and the purebloods tended to be more elitist and did not always favor the poor classes in different colonies. In fact, the poor class was not favored at all. Many of the rich and elite class in Latin America at this time owned slaves. There was very little equality. Racism actually played a sizable part in the Cabildo Abierto. At these meetings, topics often involved such things as how to deal with Indian slaves. 
 Also, the power the Cabildos Abiertos held varied in each community: 
 ""Subservience to royal administrators was most prominent in the 'capital towns,' or the seats of the audiencias and the viceroy. In the hinterland and on the frontier, where the population was forced to rely on its resourcefulness for subsistence and protection against foreigners and hostile aborigines, the cabildos sometimes evinced force and independence in the handling of municipal affairs.""  [1]Basically, when prominent authorities such as the viceroy or royal administrators were on hand, the Cabildo Abierto was likely to have a weaker impact on issues. But in more remote areas, the high authorities generally did not attend meetings. This made it easier for the the people to have an impact and get what they wanted. The fact that effectiveness varied, and that citizens views were generally overlooked at Cabildos Abiertos in the high population capitals was a problem. That meant the majority of the people were not always able to make their voices heard. 
 Purpose--The purpose of the Cabildo Abierto was to get the viewpoint of the citizens on issues that were important to the people. These issues involved elections, defense and security issues, and the allocation of funds: ""Subsequent sections set out in like fashion the sometimes obscure role of the Cabildo Abierto in the election of local officials (including such worthies as governors and a bishop), discussion of municipal religious observances, the voting of gifts of money to the crown, and measures for communal defense against pirates, indians and epidemics.""  [2]  They were considered to be a democratic institution that the South American and Central American cities and provinces used as a way to express opinions and feelings. 
 Cabildos Abiertos also served as a form of reunions, where people throughout the community would go with their neighbors. People would get together to talk and decide about what issues they considered relevant. Until the 16th century, Cabildos Abiertos were used to elect governors and other officials. Later on, the meetings became more like a town hall, where people would show up to deliberate and participate in discussions about important topics with neighbors such as defense, budgeting, and keep the government honest and in check. 
 Origins and Development 
 The first Cabildo Abierto was believed to have been held on June 10, 1541 in Chile. The mayor of Santiago had called a meeting to elect a new governor of the region. Rumors of the Spanish Conquistador and explorer Francisco Pizarro being killed in Peru had necessitated an election. The Cabildo Abierto met and nominated Pedro De Valdivia to be the governor of the province. de Valdivia accepted the nomination and was awarded power of council and assembly. He accepted and became the first governor elected by the people in Latin or South America via Cabildo Abierto.(Moore,129) [3]John Moore writes about the history in ""The Cabildo in Peru Under The Hapsburgs"", saying ""The Cabildo Abierto had its roots in the popular concejos of the Castilian towns of the Middle ages, which were a more or less fixed feature of their political life, and despite the hostility of the monarchy flourished in some regions of the Peninsula as late as the 19th century. Like other European customs and habits it was transplanted to the New World during the early period of exploration and discovery."" (Moore 125)  [3] . The Cabildo Abierto served as a way to bring the community together. It was evident that the Spanish conquerors brought the custom of meeting in this way to South America. As Moore mentioned, it is not hard to find similarities between the Cabildo Abierto and ""El Concejo Abierto Castellano-Leones,"" the Spanish version of municipal councils. El Concejo had been practiced for centuries in Spain. The meeting and reunion aspect of the Cabildo Abierto was especially useful when nominating as well as electing public officials. Cabildos Abiertos were also used to discuss issues of money and civil rights, as well health and diseases epidemics that were traveling through South and Latin America at the time. This was especially important in cities because living conditions were often unclean and disease had the tendency to spread quickly in that day and age. Public debates would be had among the residents and a vote would take place. Governors were often elected via Cabildo Abierto. In the 16th century, some colonies lost that privilege after failed uprisings. After that, the meetings continued, but more as a forum to discuss issues and hold town hall meetings to discuss topics of general interest. These topics were not always extremely important, but the Cabildo Abierto was a way to bring the people of the town together. 
 Modern Cabildos Abiertos are held in places where many people can gather. They are held often in town squares, churches, and schools. They are far more organized than they used to be, but they are still relatively informal. Modern Cabildos Abiertos do sometimes have set meeting schedules, with speakers and an itinerary though, when the first ones did not. Sometimes there is even food or entertainment (such as musical guests) at the Cabildo Abierto. Cabildos Abiertos are often called by presidential candidates as a means to connect with people and spread their message. A Cabildo Abierto can be called by pretty much any authority, as it is just a general meeting. Turnouts vary depending on the cause, but it still serves as a way to organize people, which was the original goal. 
 Participant Recruitment and Selection 
 In the earliest Cabildos Abiertos, the participants included the Governor, the Mayor or other municipal authority, and members of the church in addition to the people of the city. In respect to the citizens, it was hard to determine what number of them were chosen to participate in the Cabildo Abierto. In the first Cabildos Abiertos held in South America, the number of citizens who attended this meetings was very high. As time went on, the numbers began to decline. However, official tallies were never taken at meetings to document the number of citizens that participated. This demonstrates that the Cabildos Abiertos did not have any real structure, instead, they were operated according to customs and cultural norms of the time. There was no official parliamentary house that they were held it, nor was it a structured event in any way. Each Cabildo was different, and was catered to the topic at hand. This informal atmosphere allowed the participants at the meeting to express their feelings and opinions about the current issue being discussed. 
 As time went on, there was some debate about who should be allowed to participate in Cabildos Abiertos [1] . Indians and Mestizos who lived in the city generally did not participate. There was no actual document that forbid Indians and Mestizos, but the Cabildos Abiertos were never promoted to those two groups, and they were discouraged from coming. There was a strong racist feeling towards these groups from the Spanish and Criollos. 
 Article 9, Law 134 (of 1994) of the Colombian constitution declares the rules of the Cabildo Abierto. There is a legal process that is used to call the Cabildo Abierto in Colombia, and the constitution necessitates by law that at least 5 members per thousand (0.05%) of the electorate in question must show up to the Cabildo Abierto. Civil organizations can also call Cabildos Abiertos and make them community events. The racism that once dictated who showed up to Cabildos Abiertos does not play much of a factor in these meetings today. Any person that interested in attending a Cabildo Abierto can go to one. Colombian Cabildos Abiertos work differently than those throughout much of Latin America. A speaker is appointed by those who call the Cabildo Abierto, and only he can speak in front of the crowd. However, others may also speak to the crowd and present as long as they sign in at least 3 days before the Cabildo and present a summary of their argument to the party calling the Cabildo Abierto. Anyone can participate in the deliberation, and a decision is made by a representative of the corporation/civil organization or person who called the Cabildo Abierto. These meetings in Colombia tend to be more formal and organized than the Cabildos Abiertos throughout the rest of Latin America. 
 How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making 
 Deliberation at the first Cabildos was generally good but did not always have a huge impact on political outcome. Often, those with power would be willing to hear the voice of the people, but they would still generally make their own decisions. The amount of citizens that actually showed up at a Cabildo Abierto varied widely depending on the issue being discussed. Also, the figure of authority could decide if invitations to the Cabildo Abierto were to be extended to all citizens or only a certain number. Elitism was sometimes shown in the invitations to the Cabildo Abierto, which could limit the effectiveness and scope of the deliberation and public interaction. Adding to this, Moore asks and answers the question, ""To what extent were these assemblies deliberative entities with authority independent and separate from that of the regular cabildos? No categorical answer can be given to the question, yet in most instances they were clearly subordinate to the corporations."" (Moore, 134)  [3]It is hard to say just how much impact that the Cabildos Abiertos had on decision making within the regular Cabildo (the official governing body), but at least it provided the people with an opportunity to make their voice heard, which they had not always been able to do. Moore does add, ""It would seem that free and uncensored discussions took place and that any citizen might give his opinion on the subject before the body."" (Moore, 134) [3] . Citizens were allowed to express their own opinions without punishment, which was not always allowed at the time. This was a major step forward for deliberation in the 15th century. Also, as time went on, Cabildos Abiertos became much more powerful. Nicaragua, Peru, Argentina and Nueva Grenada all declared their independence via Cabildos Abiertos. These meetings carried real weight in the 19th and 20th century and still do today. 
 Most South American countries are very centralized, and there is a sizable disconnect between state government in the capitals and local governments in the towns that are located farther out. Cabildos Abiertos are a popular way to gather people in these smaller areas and get them involved in local government. These meetings are generally well attended and let people in these smaller towns know about what is going on in state government and how this affects local government. Debate and deliberation are often had at Cabildos Abiertos. They make people aware of lawmaking and current issues at hand. Current Cabildos Abiertos also serve as a way to keep a system of checks and balances. 
 John Gastil's book ""Political Communication and Deliberation""  [4]  defines criteria for success of the analytic process of deliberation in 5 categories: Creating a solid information base, prioritizing the key values at stake, identifying a broad range of solutions, weighing the pros, cons and tradeoffs among solutions and making the best decision possible. Cabildos Abiertos attempt to satisfy all of these criteria. They create a solid information base by allowing organizations and government and private citizens as well to state their opinions on issues that are important in the community. Citizens who attend a Cabildo Abierto are given the opportunity to deliberate and hear others deliberate as well, which strengthens their information base and level of knowledge on the local issues being discussed. This information base and level of knowledge allows them to use their opinion to prioritize the key values at stake and identify a broad range of solutions. The Cabildo Abierto starts a process that provides the foundation for successful deliberation within Gastil's formula. Once the key values have been prioritized and a broad range of solutions has been discussed, members of the Cabildo Abierto can discuss pros, cons and tradeoffs among solutions and make the best decision possible. The process of the Cabildo Abierto from start to finish covers all of these deliberative criteria, 
 Influence, Outcomes, and Effects 
 Cabildos Abiertos originally helped to integrate local people with colonizers, but over time, they became a means to unify the country. As mentioned, Latin American countries are very centralized, and Cabildos Abiertos served as a way to make rural people aware of large-scale issues that started in the cities and other areas of their countries. They serve many functions. Countries have used them to declare independence, for example. They help raise awareness about points of concern for citizens of all classes and races. A Cabildo Abierto is very valuable because it can keep leaders and members of government aware of what is really important to the citizens. Having a forum for people to have their voices heard is always necessary in any democracy, and Cabildos Abiertos allow the people of Latin America to express their concerns and feelings and give them a say in the political process of their country. 
 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 Criticisms of Cabildos Abiertos do exist, but it is important to recognize that there is no perfect way to organize the public. However, some problems that the Cabildos Abiertos did have in the early stages (approx. 16th-19th century) were things like racism, lack of inclusion of all citizens, and the king or governor's ability to override the will of the people and make a decision that does not necessarily have the citizens' best interests in mind. The Cabildo Abierto was always a good way to make voices heard, but the elite and the ""pure-bloods"" did not always share the same interests that the working class did. In addition, when the will of the people was overruled by authority, then the Cabildo Abierto that was held to discuss the issue became worthless. Some rulers were better at listening to the will of the people than others, though. However, when one decided to completely disregard the popular opinions of the citizens, the purpose of the Cabildo Abierto was disrespected. 
 Modern Cabildos Abiertos are more fair, as Latin American countries are mostly democratic. When a Cabildo Abierto is called today, it is done so with the genuine desire to hear the voice of the people. Cabildos Abiertos have grown over time and the deliberation and fairness of the meetings are stronger than ever. Also, local government was very detached from central government in the years of the first Cabildos Abiertos. With the advent of modern technology, Cabildos Abiertos can connect to central government much better and centralized issues become national topics of debate.

An unofficial mantra describing both is that we (people) learn more when we question, and question with others. Socrates Cafés are trademarked in connection with the Philosopher’s Club, and have facilitators officially trained in the method. There are over 600 official Socrates Cafés held all over the world but the Socratic Café method is used outside of the endorsed name.  Socratic Cafés are related to  Conversation Cafes ,  World Cafes , and  Kitchen Table Conversations .  According to the inventor Christopher Phillips, the Socratic Cafes were developed in response to the ineffectual way Americans go about discussions—talking over each other and not listening—which has ""taken a toll on our society"". One of the points of his decision to start up Socrates Cafés was to create an environment where the question is almost more important than the answer. Socrates Cafés are open to anyone who is looking for answers and is curious about Phillips’ own philosophy that ""what you say and think and do generally matters and counts... it is vital and incumbent for you to take an important role in society during your mortal moment.""  Origins and Development  Socrates Cafés were started by Christopher Phillips, who wanted to keep Socrates’ legacy alive, and knew that there was always more to discover about life through discussion. The best way he found to do that was to create a place where people could come and be challenged and encouraged to search for a deeper understanding of humankind.Historical/Philosophical InfluencesThe Socratic Method is the major contributor to the formation of Socrates Cafés and what influenced Phillips to create them in the first place. Socratic dialogue is able to show us how people actually view concepts or issues—everyday ones and more abstract as well. The Socratic Method encourages participants to ask, “what does this mean?” “What speaks for and against it?” “Are there alternative ways of considering it that are even more plausible and tenable?” An example might be if a question asks, “How can we overcome racism?” Thinking Socratically, one might ask if we always want to overcome racism. Are there different types or levels of racism? Are all of the forms ones we want to overcome? What has been of controversy previously, is if Phillips actually follows Socrates in attempts to provide a forum for the public. Many argue that his thinking is more along the lines of idealist or existentialist than purely Socratic.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Facilitators of Socrates Cafés are highly encouraged to reach out to marginalized groups of people to include them in discussions, such as individuals recently released from jail, people of different background histories, and more. The purpose of this is to create an environment where people can be exposed to viewpoints other than their own, but this has come into question as far as its effectiveness.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  In creating a Socrates Café group, one must make sure that they are following all of the procedures and methods spelled out by the Philosopher’s club and are representing the specific non-profit, community-creating purposes that they are intended to.  The first step to having a good Socrates Café, or an event similar, is finding a good venue. There aren’t highly specific requirements but should be in a place where discussion can go on, without large interruption. Cafés are a great place (hence the name) but the seminars can function in places such as bookstores, community centers, coffee shops etc.  Second to the process is making sure that there is one singular facilitator, and that they know their responsibilities. The facilitator is there to make sure that everyone has the chance to speak and makes sure everything remains respectful. One thing that they do not do is choose the subject or question on which the group should deliberate on. They do make sure there is a consensus, but it is not their job to provide that for the group.  To try and start picking a question seems like a daunting task, but there are a few tips to try and make it easier for your group (from a facilitator’s perspective). Firstly, all ideas for discussion questions should be voiced and written down somewhere so everyone can see. Then people can vote for as many of the questions they feel most interested in pursuing. Ask participants to keep in mind what question challenges them most, because that is what leads to enlightening discussion. After taking the highest few, you can pick your winner by giving everyone one vote and finding the highest voted for question. If you’re thinking Socratically, you aren’t quite ready to start a full-fledged discussion. As a facilitator, you must start probing for built-in assumptions surrounding or within the question, as well as embedded concepts.  A good example of the kinds of questions Socrates Cafés aim to pose comes from an example off of the official Philosopher Club website:  “a group of Socrates Café-goers wanted to examine the so-called ""gay marriage issue"" in a philosophical way, in a way that wouldn't just lead to a knockdown drag-out debate of non-redemptive putting people down and showing them up, but a way that could really examine the issue thoughtfully, and also in a way in which gay marriage was looked at in the broader context of the institution of marriage as a whole, the question was framed this way: ‘What is an excellent marriage?’” [1]  Groups will generally have a dialogue for about an hour. It is suggested that each Café be around two hours long with a short break in the middle. The time guidelines are very loose and do not mean that every Socrates Café needs to be two hours exactly. One more important fact is that the purpose of a Socrates Café is not to reach a conclusion, but to become more informed and accepting. Neither facilitator nor other participants should ever force or be forced into coming to a conclusion.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Many discussion forums’ purpose is to find a consensus on the issue/topic/question discussed. This is because the general idea is for citizens to deliberate and determine a course of action to take to some local authority so that their voices can be heard. This, however, is not the goal of a Socrates Café. The Socrates Cafés are designed for participants to learn how to question and think for themselves, and to delve into concepts in different ways than they have before. It is not only not required, but is a rule of Socrates Cafés that groups do not force a conclusion to their  deliberation . The Cafés attempt to have a feel of self-improvement and well-being as opposed to solving an issue that is not applicable to the participants themselves.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  One philosophy professor suggested that after facilitating a number of Socrates Cafés, he is unsure how much can be accomplished without luck. His reasoning was that because there is such an open format for discussion, and that the Cafés are open to everyone, it leaves a lot of room for the participants to deviate from the topic and/or have an ‘I reckon’ conversation. That just means that conversation flow is stunted by comments such as “I reckon that...” and then the next person will say, “Yeah, but I reckon that...” Another problem that has been noted by participants and facilitators is that this system is not very different from other discussions that are held. What makes it special? Distinctions from other types of deliberation are the way they choose questions and what they are looking for when trying to answer those.  Something that isn’t that commonly known about the Socrates Cafés is that it is encouraged to have more than one facilitator. This is encouraged because most of the time, facilitators are going to be respectful and follow the guidelines of the group they are leading. It is helpful to have more than one for reasons other than keeping the Café respectful though. Having more than one facilitator ensures that the Socrates Café experience remains fresh and not stale. It also makes sure that when conversation is at a lull, or there is a heated debate, that different individuals can offer their perspective on the situation while remaining calm and objective. Furthermore, while facilitators are allowed to offer up their own opinions and perspectives on the matter in which the discussion is being held on, it is important to not get overly radical. This is because as a facilitator, they are expected to protect everyone’s right to speak their minds, and if others are offended by the facilitator's ideas, they may be less likely to share, as well as put on the defensive and they might shut down all together.

 Problems and Purpose 
 ""Deliberation Day - a new national holiday.""  [1]  With this statement Bruce Ackerman and James Fishkin were the first to propose Deliberation Day (DDay) as a method for having citizens deliberating 2 weeks before the national elections for 2 days to have a better understanding of their most important issues, and to determine which candidates associate with their most valued issue. By conducting  Deliberative Polls  , Bruce Ackerman and James Fishkin have created a structural format for Deliberation Day, which starts from small town meetings, to televised debates, and to larger citizen assemblies. Eventually, by the end of this new national holiday, millions of citizens who were not able to attend the assemblies will still recognize issues that were discussed by reviewing the discussions through the Internet and televised media. 
 Origins and Development 
 Bruce Ackerman and James Fishkin had proposed Deliberation Day after assessing researches about modern public opinion. Their evaluation concluded how the public's ignorance on politics was quite negative. Citizens consider gaining political information as a ""time-consuming business,"" and put priority on personal consumptions.  [2]  The most serious problem lies within citizens gaining information through televisions and the Internet, where numerous unreliable sources exist. Still, Bruce Ackerman and James Fishkin argue how, based on their researches on Deliberative Polls, ""citizens are perfectly willing to take up the task of citizenship with appropriate settings."" [3]  As a result, Deliberation Day has been proposed for just being one possibility for this ""appropriate setting"" that citizens need. 
 Participant Recruitment and Selection 
 How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making PreparationsDeliberation Day's preparations begin a month before, with debate organizers from the National Issues Debate asking candidates 1 to 2 issues that he, or she, considers the most important to the nation. Through this session, 2 to 4 themes will be provided for citizens to deliberate. [4]Television DebateFirst, randomly selected citizens will meet in community centers, or any place that is public and accessible. They will be assigned to groups of 15 and watch televised debates of their candidates speaking about the most important issues recognized by debate organizers. After, questions will be discussed with experts on the issues and policymakers, and each participant will write questions they want to submit to the foreman of the table. The foreman will read these submitted questions in order to have citizens vote for which questions will be discussed during the larger citizen assembly. [5]First Citizen AssemblyLater, these small groups of 15 will join other smaller groups, creating a larger assembly of nearly 500 citizens. This will be the first citizen assembly of the day. Within this large assembly, a nonpartisan moderator will be chosen to ask the top-ranked questions taken from the citizens to local representatives of the competing political parties in the election. Through this Q and A session, the first assembly will be concluded. [6]Second Citizen AssemblyAfter lunch, citizens will be put back into the groups that they were in before. Within these groups, citizens will discuss if their top-ranked questions were answered adequately during the first assembly. If they were, citizens will create new questions, or they will discuss ""neglected"" questions that weren't able to be discussed due to the lack of time. The second assembly will begin at 3 p.m. following a similar format of a Q and A session between the moderator and the local representatives dealing with the neglected questions, or the new questions created. [7]Final PhaseBy 4:15 p.m. citizens will have a reflecting period. The reflecting period is when citizens discuss about their impressions they had felt during the day. This includes their impressions on if their most important questions were answered, which party representative had done a better job, or if they had changed their minds due to Deliberation Day. The main point of this final session deals with citizens recognizing which issues are at stake within the nation, not voting for their final decisions on matters. 
 At 5 p.m. the foreman of each group will sign each participant's certificates. Although Deliberation Day is not a mandatory event, participation will be paid a stipend of $150. Deliberation Day is a 2-day event: with celebrations held throughout the nation due to the completion of deliberation on the first day, citizens will be aware, and might even participate, on the second day for setting another agenda for the national elections. [8]Influence, Outcomes, and Effects 
 Deliberation Day is still taken consideration as a method for effective deliberation. Due to this, there are no case studies to examine if Deliberation Day had been effective. However, Bruce Ackerman and James Fishkin have conducted nearly 20 Deliberative Polls to assess how much Deliberation Day will impact citizens' ""attitudes, information, political preferences, and voting intentions.""  [9]  The reason why Deliberative Polls have been assessed is because it provides the basis format for Deliberation Day: randomly selected citizens deliberate on issues in group sessions with citizens asking questions and receiving answers. 
 One particular Deliberative Poll Bruce Ackerman and James Fishkin regard as important is the National Issues Convention (NIC) held in Austin, Texas in January 1996. In 1996, James Fishkin had conducted the NIC, which was broadcasted by PBS (Public Broadcasting Service). During this event, randomly selected citizens deliberated on 3 issues provided by the Public Agenda: America's definition of the state of the family, the nation's economy, and America's foreign affairs. The NIC had survey respondents asking policy experts and 4 Republican candidates who were running for the national elections questions about the issues and received answers. [10]  Through this convention's assessment, James Fishkin had concluded the following points which will also apply for Deliberation Day's impact: [11]Citizens gain information. 
 Citizens change their opinions and vote accordingly to their changes. 
 Preferences do not necessarily polarize or homogenize. Analysis and Lessons Learned The PositivesWith the points assessed from the Deliberative Poll experiments, James Fishkin has stated major positive outcomes of Deliberation Day: Deliberation makes a difference. [12]  Through sustained and structured conversations, citizens have replied how such informing events have changed their opinions and votes significantly. 
 Deliberation creates balance. [13]  Before citizens come to discuss, they understand only one side of the issue and disagree with others. Through face-to-face discussions, this gap closes with citizens understanding both sides of the issue, although they might not necessarily agree with one of them. 
 Citizens begin to feel responsible for the solutions they make. [14]  Through informed discussions, citizens look beyond self-interests and consider public goods. The NegativesDespite such positive points towards effective deliberation, Deliberation Day faces several critiques in order for it to become effective in the future. Cost. Deliberation Day is an expensive event. Even Bruce Ackerman and James Fishkin consider this point critical. The estimated total budget states that if 50 million citizens participate, Deliberation Day will cost over $1.5 billion. If 70 million citizens participate, the event will cost over $2 billion. [15]Law of Group Polarization. One important critique of deliberation comes from Cass R. Sunstein who argues that group deliberation eventually leads to group polarization. Put simply, people do what they believe others do, or what others want them to do. [16]Problem with mediated (indirect) society-wide deliberation. Archon Fung states how ""public communicative power is, however, necessarily indirect in its political impact."" [17]  Such nation-wide, and participatory, deliberation has a weak connection with the process of making public policy; therefore, there is little political relevance. 
 American election law hinders Deliberation Day. Chad Flanders states how Deliberation Day fails to consider America's protection of political parties, which cause opinions that are not voiced within the major political parties to be highly excluded. Chad Flanders also states how in order to have effective deliberation, not only citizens, but also the President and representatives in Congress have to deliberate. [18]See Also

Although it is not a new technique, the internet has increased the scale and responsiveness of this approach.  The internet provides an unprecedented medium in which users from disparate backgrounds and geographic locations can meet, interact, and share ideas. Crowdsourcing is the leveraging and focusing of the largely untapped talent and brain power of well-educated amateurs who are interested in a given topic but do not happen to be professionally employed in these fields. Other tasks that are not highly complex, but difficult for a computer to accomplish, such as describing a photograph, are compatible with crowdsourcing.  One of the most important factors of crowdsourcing is the fact that it is an open call for help, allowing any internet user to contribute. Because of this, organizations are able to draw upon a huge population of users who are able to self-select themselves into addressing the problems they are most fit to solve. This is accomplished through facilitating users' contributions in a created space that has a framework and basic guidelines while remaining as open as possible in order to receive diverse submissions. As explained by Beth Simone Noveck, the diverse perspectives users have results in submissions that are more inventive and regularly of higher quality than solutions created by hired research professionals surrounded by like-minded people.[1]  By providing some kind of incentive, usually payment, many users are often tempted to try to solve these problems, but only those who create substantive results are rewarded. This creates a structure in which organizations can receive large amounts of manpower at very little cost, while at the same time often receiving vital information on the nature and wishes of their participants. For corporations, crowdsourcing provides them not only with solutions but also consumer's perspectives on their products, which can then be used to refine their corporation in ways unrelated to the problem at hand.  Origins and Development  Although first coined by Jeff Howe in a 2006 edition of, the process had already been implemented by a few online companies. Some of the first examples come from companies Threadless and iStockPhoto. On threadless.com, users may submit graphics for tshirts and are selected by the community by clicking ""I'd buy it!"". The most popular designs are printed and offered for sale, with the winning designer receiving $2000 and $500 as a Threadless gift certificate [2]. iStockPhoto is a similar community of amateur photographers that collectively create a large database of stock photographs. Any organization looking for royalty-free photographs can buy them at a significantly lower price than hiring a professional photographer. The size of the site quickly exploded, providing more pictures to choose from than any single stock photographer could provide. Contributors to the site receive a 20% commission every time their photographs are purchased, and depending on the success of their photographs their commission can rise to 40%[3].  After Howe's article detailing the advantages of crowdsourcing,[4] this production model was then adopted by offline companies, as seen in marketing strategies for Doritos and Chevy automobiles that called on consumers to create commercials for them. As a result of this program a user created Dorito advertisement was aired during the 2007 Super Bowl [5], reflecting the rapid and highly publicized adoption of crowdsourcing in the business world.  How it Works  The process of crowdsourcing varies in its scope and design. Below are some examples of the process in action:InnoCentive:Innocentive is one of the earliest and most developed platforms for crowdsourcing currently on the web. Hundreds of highly complex engineering, chemistry, medical, and environmental challenges are posted on the website at any given time, most with rewards ranging from $5,000 to $1,000,000. Innocentive is designed as an intermediary that connects corporations, non profits, and government to a motivated user base of more than 200,000 so called ""solvers"". Some users have even quit their day jobs to pursue solving these problems full time[6].Wikipedia:Wikipedia is arguably the most successful example of non-profit crowdsourcing. Beginning in 2001, Wikipedia is a platform in which any online user can contribute to an online encyclopedia. Despite an absence of any form of compensation, the urge to solidify a collective conscious online has created an exhaustive, fact-checked, and free encyclopedia in dozens of languages. There are currently over 14 million articles posted on Wikipedia, 3 million of them English, all provided free of charge by users [7]. Superfluous and incorrect information is removed through peer review and expert volunteer moderators.Next Stop Design:A program sponsored by the Federal Transportation Administration and developed by researchers from the University of Utah, Next Stop Design calls upon internet users to design a bus stop in the Sugarhouse neighborhood of Salt Lake City. The winning designer received a free u=Utah transit authority bus pass for a year. The winner was decided from 11,000 votes on 260 submissions [8].Skuggaþing (Shadow Parliament) andBetri Reykjavík (Better Reykjavík):In the last (2010) municipal elections in Reykjavík, the capital city of Iceland, almost 10% of the voting population took part in the majority talks of two parties via a website called Betri Reykjavik (Better Reykjavik). The history of the website and the software developed for it is recounted in this document.  The greatest strength of the system is that it uses the opinions of its users (crowd-sourcing) to evaluate the importance, quality and usefulness of the ideas/issues and also crowd-sources the selection of the best arguments/points for and against those ideas/issues. Thus, users are able to make up their minds about most issues in a very short time.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Because crowdsourcing is essentially a production model, the outcome is emphasized more than in other deliberative models. When structured properly, crowdsourcing can create solutions and products that professionals cannot largely due to the size of people contributing. After aggregating the responses, submissions are of higher quality than what the most intelligent participant could have created, as observed by James Surowiecki's in his book,  The Wisdom of Crowds. [9]  Another effect of crowdsourcing is the empowerment contributors experience when they are able to solve a problem or design a successful product. Exploitation of these users is a source of continuing concern, as mentioned by Jeff Howe in his seminal article on crowdsourcing; but, contributors enter these agreements willingly and usually with enthusiasm, as they would not be paid for using their talents in their current jobs and may view contributing as a release of pent up talent they cannot use in their regular lives. Because results are often only known to and capitalized by the organization, however, this is not a perfectly democratic method.  As a deliberative process, crowdsourcing is unique. It is able to unite large numbers of like minded individuals to work on the same problem, but it causes problems as well as opportunities. Because of the economic incentive involved in most crowdsourcing, the nature of the  deliberation  is competitive. Providing a reward does increase the number of submissions, but this also leads to a lack of communication between users, as they want the prize for themselves. Organizations that crowdsource are often able to sift through the submissions and often do receive a satisfactory result, but if users were encouraged to actively collaborate among themselves, better results could appear. This is a difficult thing to accomplish due to the asynchronous nature of the internet, and could slow down the process. In an interview, Andrea Grover proposes that the impersonal nature of the internet allows for more submissions because users are less aware of judgments that may be made on their submissions and are therefore more likely to contribute.[10] Introducing direct collaboration to crowdsourcing could end up causing valuable information to be self-censored by self-conscious users.  One of the primary problems of this method as a way to further democracy has been its application. Because of its business based development, it is still primarily used to benefit individual entrepreneurs. Although self satisfaction is a facet of what draws internet users to participate in solving problems for other people, the economic incentive is often the driving factor. As a deliberative process, however, crowdsourcing has potential applications in essentially every idea based field, and its low cost can be used to accomplish more than low overhead, as seen in the previous non profit and governmental examples. The interactive and empowering facets of crowdsourcing have been observed within the private sector as effectively creating tight knit communities and provide critical insight into consumer's opinions. If implemented correctly, more governmental and non profit organizations could use crowdsourcing solely for the public interest. Beth Simone Noveck observes, however, that government has largely not embraced the internet's potential as a participatory forum. If correctly implemented, government could capitalize on the cheap labor of crowdsourcing to solve problems for the greater good, while at the same time empowering, involving, and connecting citizens to their own government.

184,method,Conversation Cafés,https://participedia.net/method/184,"Conversation Cafés are openly hosted conversations designed to engage participants in stimulating dialogue on relevant societal issues, thereby allowing them to express and develop informed opinions in a mutually respectful way.",0,2010-12-07,2020-03-21,262,Yunakim,https://participedia.net/user/262,417734,"""Jaskiran Gakhal Participedia Team""",https://participedia.net/user/417734,en,1,facetoface,,open,,polarized,moderate,informal, deliberative, participantled,small, medium,,city/town, neighbourhood,,informal, storytelling, discussion,idea,,,,,develop,,," Problems and Purpose  Conversation Cafés are openly hosted conversations in local coffee shops, but are also widely entertained inside, but not limited to, restaurants, conference rooms, churches, and classrooms. This participatory method was intentionally designed in efforts to gather friends, neighbors, acquaintances, and strangers to exchange something more than ""small talk"" on a regular basis. The agenda is set in hopes to create stimulating conversations among a diverse set of minds who have a common goal to not only express their own preferences, but to further explore, develop, and possibly rehabilitate their own opinions through the engagement with others in their community. [1]  Conversation Cafés aim to foster a society that actively engages in important social topics, which are newly selected for each gathering, by creating a temporary environment that promotes--through mild facilitation--certain conversational etiquette, including open-mindedness, acceptance, curiosity, discovery, sincerity, and brevity. [1] The project addresses the need to escape the crippling dangers of a repressive society, and attempts to increase social intelligence through the construction of social capital, thus generating social engagement. [2] From this practice of the ""Socratic tradition"" of respectful dialogue, these Conversation Cafés aspire to build a more enlightened--and thus wiser--democracy. The minimal, simplistic, and undemanding structure of its agenda allows for this hosted event to seem feasible for anyone and everyone to become a part of the small group, transforming interpersonal communication from trivial topics to conversations that matter. The goal is not to refine answers, pick out flaws, and decide on a list of solutions from a pool of ideas, but rather to listen respectfully, cultivate individual ideas and vocalize them, and suspend judgments about others in the process.  Conversation Cafes are related to methods like  The World Cafe ,  Socratic Cafés , and  Kitchen Table Conversations .  Origins and Development  The inception of Conversation Cafés took place in the summer of 2001, in the city of Seattle, Washington. The idea was conceived by author Vicki Robin and her friends, Susan Partnow and Habib Rose. Living with the mantra that more spontaneous, casual public dialogue would better mold the critical minds that make up our democracy all the while simultaneously fostering friendly relations, each of the three Seattle women sat in a different café every week and began conversations with neighboring customers on important matters. Officially, on September 10, 2001, what began as a simple fostering of coffee house meetings for casual yet stimulating discussions on current issues amongst customers continued on into what is now recognized as Conversation Cafés.  From that moment in history, this method of participatory  deliberation  spread throughout the city of Seattle and ultimately caught on in seventy cities in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. New Road Map Foundation funded the project from its primordial stages, with the Foundation for Global Community and Bob and Jacquelyn Pogue's foundation contributing large sums as well.  [1]The invention of ""Conversation Week"" premiered soon after, where all Conversation Cafes across the world pondered over the same topic for one week each year. Through this global communication and exchange of ideas, a sense of patriotic unity emerged. Co-founders Vicki and Susan transferred the project to Bob and Jacquelyn Pogue, who are now the head stewards of the online Conversation Café website. [1]  Participant Recruitment and SelectionKnow how participants are recruited for this method? Help uscomplete this section! How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The process of Conversation Cafés follows a conventional outline. In its inception, hosts assemble up to 10 people and generally have a topic or theme selected prior to the event. As a part of the introduction, the host explains the Conversation Café agreements, which promote respect, suspends judgment, seeks understanding and new insights rather than persuasion, sharing of personal testimonies and honesty. [1] Once the conversational maxims are pledged to be adhered to by all participants, the host explains the step-by-step process of what is about to occur in the following 60-90 minutes. Furthermore, a ""Talking Object"" is presented, which permits only the speaker who has the Talking Object in hand to present their views, and is then passed along the circle in a timely manner (individuals are allowed to ""pass"" and not say anything). The Talking Object can be any miscellaneous item.  Once the rules and goals of the event are unanimously understood among all participants, the host should pass out pencils and paper/index cards for people to jot down their thoughts. The conversation begins with introductions and then proceeds into round 1, where each person briefly addresses the topic at hand with no reciprocated feedback from others, using the Talking Object. Then, round 2 takes place as the Talking Object is still in a motion, with each individual further explaining in explicit detail their prior comments and thoughts, or any fresh insights they had arrived at since then. At the end of the facilitated rounds using the Talking Object, the host opens up the floor to free dialogue. At this time, groups participate in open, spirited conversation, and the Talking Object is only implemented to control contention, domination, or to redirect tangent conversations that are far from the topic at hand. To conclude, the last 5-10 minutes before the ending time is devoted to the final round, which reintroduces the Talking Object, as each person takes a moment to reflect and briefly state how their prior ways of thinking had changed, refined, or strengthened. [2]  While Conversation Cafés have this general skeletal outline of communication, there are three, narrowly defined types of conversations that can occur in response to unique circumstances: Café Lite (less than 45 minutes), Instant Café (spontaneous), and Super Café (large events).[1]  Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsCase Study:Community X-ChangeFrom 2005 to 2006, this case study that took place in the United Kingdom, analyzed the beginnings of a series of  workshops  where members of the public, scientists, and policy makers came together to discuss relevant issues on science. [2] This new method for dialogue provided an isolated area of time and space in which these individuals could converse about ideas for possible actions concerning the policy of climate change.  Participants were carefully selected in order to ensure a diverse range of views, and they met on a regular basis to talk about the climate change with regards to other science and technology issues. A rigor structure was provided to guide the discussions of the group. Individuals of the study attended an interactive video report at the 2006 BA Festival of Science in Norwich. [2]  As for the results of the study, a majority of the members had genuinely expected that something was going to be produced from their efficient process of discourse, and that the ideas generated would be presented to decision-makers. By creating a safe, constructive space for scientists and citizens to communicate, the two compartmentalized groups found a common language to relate with. More specifically, scientists overcame their fears of a two-way engagement with the public individuals. [2]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The minimal cost and necessities to host a Conversation Café makes it an appealing and inviting method of deliberation since all that is needed is an open, public space and a willing individual to host the event. [3] Other strengths regard its informality, flexibility, and its encouragement to actively listen, learn, and share different views. Weaknesses include its lack of structure and rigor, and that the activity does not lead to any particular goal except accomplishing the social deed of conversation and dialogue. [4]  In terms of its evaluation as a deliberative process, the overall analytic process of deliberation is moderately to highly successful. The introduction phase allows the time and encourages individuals to discuss personal and emotional experiences, especially those attending with not much prior legal background information regarding the topics at hand. With the opening time of silence to digest the announced topic, participants are encouraged to reflect on their own values before the speaking portion of the event begins. Beyond that, the use of the Talking Object not only regulates equal distribution of speaking time, but it also allows for those who are listening to reflect on the communicated values they hear as well as their own, as they wait for their turn to speak. Since the main goal of Conversation Cafésis to produce a free flow of ideas, suspending own opinions to bring alternative views that are often eclipsed from our own view to light, this method ideally works to generate a range of different ideas and possibilities. Furthermore, as the last stage of the method is a time where each individual reflects and has one minute to summarize their new insights, the development of refined judgments in light of what was said is the ultimate if not only goal of this deliberative method.  In terms of the overall social process of deliberation, it is also fairly successful. To begin, the implementation of a Talking Object strictly ensures a balanced discussion in which no one person is denied the opportunity to speak. Each turn is evenly distributed by time. The middle round of open discussion allows for members to respond to other comments, as well as ask clarifying questions, listening carefully to each voice even in disagreement since there is no pressure to reach a consensus. The thoroughly constructed skeletal outline of the conversation leaves no room for disrespectful behaviors, but if any were to be exchanged, the presence of a host would regulate the matter. Therefore, the overall social process set in these coffee houses are cooperative and considerate in regards to each member of the small group.

Originating from a book of the same title onparliamentary procedure , the revised edition aims specifically at deliberative assemblies. Robert's Rules operates under the idea of majority rule while still acknowledging and respecting minority opinion. [1]  The system of debate allows for this by ensuring equal speaking opportunities from all sides. Currently in its 11th edition, the book has enjoyed widespread success and is used by 85% of all organizations in the United States. [2]Origins and Development  The first edition of Robert’s Rule of Order appeared in 1876. [3]  The author, Henry Martyn Robert (1837-1923), was Brigadier General in the U.S. Army whose original motivation for the title came in 1863 after being asked to preside over a church meeting in San Francisco. [4]  Despite having little experience in parliamentary procedure, Robert accepted the offer and was embarrassed and humbled by his futile effort to control the passions and flow of the meeting. [5]  Resolving to learn more about his failure, Robert was determined to educate himself on the process of parliamentary procedure, beginning what would become 14 years of study on the subject. His main source of correct procedures came from the U.S. House of Representatives, a system based loosely off the British House of Commons. [6]  This, in turn, led to a study of the writings of Thomas Jefferson who was largely responsible for the version of early parliamentary procedure practiced in the U.S. at the federal level of government. [7]  Robert supplemented this study with real world experience gained by attending numerous and varying types of meetings as his continued army service found him stationed all over the country throughout his study. His attendance at these meetings led him to realize that meetings were practiced with great variance throughout the nation and often had limited success. [8]  His solution was to design a manual to clarify proceedings in order to have a common source available to all that would assist in the organization and effectiveness of meetings.  In February of 1876, the first phase of his study concluded with the publication of the Pocket Manual of Rules of Order for Deliberative Assemblies. [9]  The cover of the book simply read Robert’s Rules of Order, a title to which the work would henceforth be known. The book sold through its initial print and a second printing was completed in July that same year. [10]  A third edition was published in 1893 and a revised edition appeared in 1915. [11]  The revised fourth edition would also mark the last edition that Robert would publish himself. Upon Robert’s death in 1923, a trust headed by his family was set up to handle all future editions of the title. [12]  Two more editions closely tied to the original work would be published before the book was rewritten for the 7th edition. [13]  Robert’s Rules of Order Newly Revised was released in 1970 and represented a new approach by the Robert’s family trust. Whereas all prior editions assumed a familiarity with parliamentary procedure, the seventh edition was designed to have greater appeal to the general public. The resulting title was far more explanatory than the previous editions, allowing the layman to understand the rationale for the proceedings as well as the procedures. [14]  Subsequent editions have stuck with this model and having only been slightly modified to reflect technological changes and their effects on meetings.  How it Works  Anyone can use Robert's Rules of Order and selection depends upon the assembly. It is used in many settings where any and all are welcome to join the debate, such as  town hall meetings , booster clubs, and more; however, it can also be used in larger scale government settings. In some cases, members may need to be elected as representatives, at other times people will be able to represent themselves. Outside presenters are allowed within the rules, so even representative forums can expand debate and hear opinions from people other than members.  In general, Robert's Rules of Order operates under the idea of majority rule while still acknowledging and respecting minority opinion. [15]  The system of debate allows for this by ensuring equal speaking opportunities from all sides. [16]  This in turn creates a solid information base as each member is given the same time to present his or her opinion.  Robert's Rules are organized around the idea of a presented motion. [17]  All motions have a precedence [18]  which means that they can only be used when they have a higher precedence than all other active motions. The most basic of all motions is called the Main Motion, which is a policy or item that the body would like to discuss and cover with debate. [19]  For example, if a member wishes to use funds to buy something for the organization, they could ask for recognition by the chairman and state ""I move that we spend X amount of money to purchase Y for our organization."" For almost all motions, recognition by the residing chairperson is required before actually making the motion. [20]Some motions, including Main Motions, must be seconded by another member of the body. [21]  Seconding does not mean that the person who seconded agrees with the motion but rather that he or she would like to hear debate on the motion. [22]  The idea that seconding does not signify agreeing highlights how Robert's Rules are intended to foster  deliberation  — the idea is to discuss each topic and vote based on the discussions heard from all participating members.  However, there are some drawbacks to the debate system. Debates are often timed [23]  which, while keeping debaters concise and allowing for more speakers, could potentially limit the information presented in each debate. Also, similar to other methods of  parliamentary procedure , debate is intended to move in a way that allows for everyone to speak if they so desire [24]  and to alternate from pro to con or vice versa. This often stifles chances for direct rebuttal as the next speaker is likely not to have been the previous debater, that is if another member gives a state that you would like to rebut, but you have just spoken, you will likely not be able to give your rebuttal unless there are no other speakers.  There are other methods of discussion used in Robert's Rules. One of the most notable is the ability to send any motion to a committee. [25]  Committee parameters are set out by the chairperson, [26]  but they can range from simply exploring the subject in a more personal setting, bringing in and listening to outside presenters, completing research, to actually reaching a decision on the motion.  A notable feature of Robert's Rules is the Chairperson, who has the purpose of keeping order in the assembly. The chairperson must often remain partial and does not usually have a chance to speak and is even less likely to have the ability to vote (a chairperson may vote if it is done by secret ballot or where the vote would change the result). [27]  However, the chairperson keeps the meeting on track, guarantees the equal speaking opportunities, and ensures that respect is paid to all members. [28]The debate allows for all sides to present their key values while listening to others', however, it is possible that debaters will try to discredit the other speaker's or prove them incorrect, which could lead to a reduction in deliberativeness. Yet, solutions have been provided. For example, motions could be sent to committee which allow for more open discussion that is more likely to lead to compromise and decision-making as the participants are not restricted as much by rules for debate. Also, the rules include opportunities to leave a motion on the table in order to consider it later and for taking short recesses which both allow time for discussion that is, again, not marred by the rules of debate. [29]Decisions, when referring to main motions, are decided by a majority vote provided that the assembly is at quorum. [30]  Votes that result in a tie fail. [31]  Very little can be done while following Robert's Rules without the consent of the assembly, which helps to ensure that, while there is a presiding officer, control is not given to one person. The chairperson can make exclusive decisions only for calling the orders of the day (reading the agenda) or questions of privilege (when a member asks the chair for permission to perform a personal task such as going to the restroom or opening a window because the room is too hot). Other than that, every decision, even the decision whether or not to vote, is voted upon.  Further deliberative action can be seen in motions that allow the assembly to reconsider a motion that has failed or passed. [32]  Any motion can be called upon again and, assembly permitting, be reconsidered once again. This reopens debate, allowing for discussion and will eventually lead to another vote which could change the outcome of the previous decision. This certifies more discussion which could lead to a better, more informed solution.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The effect of Robert’s Rules of Order is just as present today as it was nearly 135 years ago when it was first published. Henry Robert’s work continues to have an impact because it addresses a major but often missing element necessary for a successful organization: a set of agreed-upon rules designed to navigate difficult decisions and devised to limit the effects of emotions. This has resulted in the parliamentary procedures presented by the book being adopted by 85% of all organizations in the United States. [33]  Most organizations adopt the book outright as the cornerstone of their proceedings. In the event of a disagreement or other conflict, the title is treated as an authority unto itself. The presence of Robert’s Rules can be found in board meetings, city and county councils, student governments, school boards, P.T.A. meetings, homeowner associations, etc. [34]  The soundness of its procedures has been affirmed by courts with numerous jurisdictions finding that all organizations are subject to the rules and principles of parliamentary standards. Organizations that fail to follow the rules after adoption have been the subjects of lawsuits and the recipients of embarrassment. [35]Robert’s Rules of Order has even had an impact on the House of Representatives, the original source for many of the procedures. In 1994, after Democrats lost their legislative majority in the House, Rep. Barney Frank (D) was tasked with studying Robert’s book in order to discover methods the minority party could employ in order to remain relevant. When the Democrats regained the House in 2006, Frank returned to the book in order to devise a strategy to enhance their new majority status.  While oftentimes any person can become involved in some way with an organization that uses Robert's Rules, they might often find that the rules vary. For example, Robert's Rules is now in its eleventh edition, [36]  but the other editions are still used by some. Rules can be permanently changed to suit the needs of the organization, which while useful for personalizing the rules, can also lead to some inconsistencies. However, the rules do have a uniformity that is beneficial. [37]Some people new to an organization may feel flustered by the rather extensive rules, but if they have a basic knowledge it is not too difficult to catch on to how each organization uses the rules even if they are altered. The issue still arises with learning the rules, however, since they are extensive, involved, and complicated, to the extent that they are even used in a competitive arena. The National FFA Organization and other groups actually create teams that study the rules and perform mock sessions in front of a panel of judges while trying to be as accurate and efficient with the rules as possible. [38]  And while competition may serve as a motivator for learning the rules, it also highlights an important problem: the rules are not immediately user-friendly. Anyone new to using Robert's Rules of Order may be bombarded with pages and pages of dull writing that is often discouraging. The rules are intricate and without a firm grasp of them, it is easy to miss out on your chance to fully involve yourself in discussion. So, after tackling the daunting task of actually learning and memorizing all of the rules, any person should be able to join any assembly and have at least a stable enough grasp on the procedure to participate no matter the changes.OutlookAt 704 pages as of its tenth edition, Robert’s Rules of Order is only likely to grow. As  technology  evolves, presenting new ways for people to meet and discuss issues at hand, Robert’s Rules will be necessary to determine the proper procedures under circumstances far different from the author’s original outlook. The 11th edition demonstrates this adaptability by weighing in on electronic meetings. [39]  Similarly, the 10th edition notes that video conferencing is okay so long as everyone can both hear and speak in real time while email meetings are not because they lack this function. [40]As it continues to evolve, it is certain that Robert's Rules of Order will continue to strive for a comprehensive and efficient form of deliberation. Currently, it uses a system of turn-based debate with options for further discussion to allow for opinions and views from all sides to be expressed equally. Though complicated for beginners and intricate in application, a thorough understanding of the rules allows for participation in nearly every organization that uses it even with differing editions and more personalized rules. Robert's Rules of Order do just as their namesake implies; they give order to discussion with the intent of furthering deliberation.  See AlsoParliamentary ProcedureReferences  Robert, Henry.

 Washington State uses the initiative process which gives direct power to the voters to enact new laws or change existing ones effectively allowing the electorate to place legislation on the ballot so long as they meet certain criteria. By collecting a certain number of signatures an initiative can be placed on the ballot. This is a form of  Direct Democracy  . 
 The Purpose of the Washington State Initiative process is to empower citizens to take an active role proposing, amending, or repealing new legislation for consideration by Washington voters. 
 Citizens of Washington can use the initiative process to enact two separate types of initiatives as well as two separate type of referenda: 
 • Initiatives to the People – to directly enact a new state law 
 • Initiatives to the Legislature – indirectly enact a new state law 
 • Referendum Measures – Laws recently passed by the legislature and put to a vote by the people 
 • Referendum Bills – Laws referred to the voters by the legislature 
 Origins and Development 
 Washington State official adopted the initiative and referendum process and added it to the state constitution in 1912. In the State of Washington the initiative and representative process was originally proposed by L.E Reeder of Ollalla and passed by a vote of 63 to 12 in the lower house, but failed in the state senate. In 1911 the both houses of the legislature passed, but did not allow voters to initiate state constitutional amendments. Voters then ratified the Initiative and Referendum Bill in 1912. 
 Washington State Voters immediately put to use their new powers and circulated petitions to put seven initiatives on the 1914 ballot, but succeeded in getting only five of those initiatives on the ballot in 1914 with only one being approved which was a measure to abolish private employment agencies. The intent of this law was to stop exploitation of unemployed workers, such as lumberjacks by these private employment agencies. 
 A statewide prohibition initiative was also enacted in 1914 much to the dislike of liquor interests who originally opposed the Initiative and Referendum amendment to the state constitution. The following year ant-initiative forces within the legislature passed a bill that would have made it virtually impossible to place an initiative on the ballot. In response Washington voters used the power of the referendum to block this bill from going into effect until voters could eventually vote it down in the 1916 election by a three to one margin. 
 In response to voters efforts to exercise their right to the Referendum the legislature soon discovered that they could bypass the referendum process by attaching an “emergency clause” to a bill and making it invulnerable to referendum petitions. In 1929 the state Supreme Court ruled the practice of attaching emergency clauses to bills with the intention of bypassing referendum petitions in the absence of a true emergency. 
 An initiative approving the creation of locally controlled and publically owned electric utility districts was approved in the 1930’s and in 1968 Washington voters approved an initiative requiring drivers stopped by police officers to submit to breathalyzer tests. 
 Participant Recruitment and Selection 
 For an initiative, in the state of Washington, any registered voter who is acting as an individual or for an organization, has the right can propose legislation to create a new state law or amend or amend or appeal existing statutes. 
 How it works: Process, Interaction and Decision-Making 
 To appear on the ballot, the sponsor of the initiative must file a printed or typed copy of the complete text of the proposed initiative with the office of the Secretary of State along with a ($5.00) filling fee as well as a sworn affidavit that the sponsor of the initiative is a legal voter in the state of Washington which all become a matter of public record. 
 Initiatives to the People must be filed within ten months prior to the next state general election and the signature sheets must be filed no less than four months prior to the next general election. 
 Initiatives to the Legislature must be filed ten months prior to the next regular session of the Legislature and the signature sheets must be filed no less than ten days prior to the next regular session of the Legislature. 
 Both types of initiative measures require a minimum number of signatures equal to eight percent of the number of votes cast for the office of Governor in the last regular gubernatorial election. 
 For a referendum the legislature may require that a law must be submitted for voter approval. 
 Or 
 Any registered voter who is acting as an individual or for an organization may demand, through a petition, that a law that has been passed by the legislature be put to a vote in the general election before it goes into effect except in the case of emergency legislation. 
 Both types of referendum measures require a minimum number of signatures equal to four percent of the number of votes cast for the office of Governor in the last regular gubernatorial election. 
 Influence, Outcomes and Effects Initiatives to the People:  When certified as having enough signatures this type of initiative is submitted to a vote at the next state general election and will appear on the ballot. Initiatives to the Legislature:  When certified as having enough signatures this type of initiative is submitted to the Legislature at its regular session each January. After being submitted to the Legislature, the Legislature can take one of three options: 
 • The Legislature can adopt the initiative as it has been proposed by the public and in this case it becomes law without it a vote by the people 
 • The Legislature can reject the proposed initiative or refuse to act on it and in this case the initiative must be placed on the ballot for the state’s next general election 
 • The Legislature can approve an amended version of the proposed initiative and this this case both the amended and the original versions of the bill will appear on the state’s next general election ballot. 
 Referenda are designed to either approve or reject laws that have been either enacted or proposed by the Washington State Legislature. Laws that are exempted from the power of referendum include emergency laws. Emergency Laws are defined as those that are necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety, and the support of state government and its existing institution. Referendum Measures  are laws that have recently been passed by the Legislature and are placed on the general ballot due to petitions being signed by voters. Referendum Bills  are laws originally proposed by the Legislature which are then are referred to the electorate by the legislature. 
 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 Overall the initiative process allows constituents to actively engage with their legislators and respond voice what they believe are essential needs for the community. The referendum process also provides a line of communication that allows the Washington electorate to respond and block legislation that they believe to be detrimental or undesirable. 
 The Initiative and Referendum process has received criticism that it undermines representative democracy and places too much power in the hands of the electorate who have often been conserved fickle or lacking in a deep understanding of the issues that surround various initiatives and referenda. Critics believe that it would be better to allow legislators who they perceive to have a deeper understanding of issues and that the public interest would be better served by legislatures. 
 Criticism has also reach legislators as they have been said to use the “emergency clause” too freely when passing through touchy bill. The power struggle continues as the electorate continues to spar with legislators over who should have more authority in passing legislation. The tug of war continues as pro-initiative groups and individuals such as Tim Eyman work to limit the decision making power of legislators with his recent I-1053 requiring a super majority vote in both houses or a referendum by the electorate to raise taxes. Initiatives such as this place more of a burden on the electorate to effectively raise taxes. Which as the cost continues to rise to effectively sponsor new initiatives make it more difficult for “mom and pop” sponsors to sponsor new initiatives which could widen the gap of accessible government and detract from the original purpose of the initiative process which is, to empower citizens to take an active role proposing new legislation for the ballot, but which becomes increasingly more difficult as the cost of running a successful initiative campaign rises. 
 Further criticism of the initiative process says that the initiative and referenda system in the state of Washington has trended increasing toward being big business. While the official filing fee for a new initiative is only five dollars the cost of creating awareness and gathering signatures for initiatives and referenda has become very expensive since Washington initially adopted I&amp;R legislation in 1912. The large numbers of signatures that are required to get an initiative on the ballot are extremely high and have turned initiative campaigning into and industry for Individuals such as Tim Eyman. As the cost of acquiring the approx. 240 thousand signatures required (8% of the total votes for governor in 2008) continue to rise as companies emerge that charge per name for gathering signatures (signature gathers are not required to be Washington State voters).

 Problems and Purpose 
 Kgotla meetings were large tribal assemblies that were used by Tswana chiefs to discuss important issues, policies and legislation with their subjects. Boris Weber, writing for the World Bank's anti-corruption blog, described the kgotla assembly as ""a democratic process in which the village chief would consult with local villagers who have the right to express their views and concerns."" [1]  He was of course referring to present day kgotla meetings, which although important to Botswanan political life, are much smaller than the kind of traditional tribal assemblies which occurred during that nation's earlier years. Although their names and procedures varied somewhat depending on the importance of the issue being discussed as well as the nature of the issue itself, meetings of this sort all shared the same basic structure. The general goal of the system was to attain consensus on whatever issue or potential law the assembly happened to be discussing. The system also served to notify chiefs of their proposal's popularity (or lack thereof.) In this respect it was both a consultative and an indirectly participatory practice. Note that the word kgotla actually refers to the building or area in which the assembly takes place but in the literature is commonly used to denote the assemblies that commonly met there as well. 
 Origins and Development 
 The Tswana had begun to develop the kgotla tradition during the early 1800s and by the time British Empire had incorporated the nation of Botswana under their imperialist wing as the Bechuanaland Protectorate in 1885, the Tswana people had already developed a unique political culture centered around public consultation. [3]  The British government, in concurrence with its indirect governance strategy, encouraged this propensity through legislation which put into law what many chiefs had already begun to do, that is, bring all potential laws before a public assembly so as to benefit from their consult. So from then on, after devising legislation together with his advisers, the chief was expected to call a tribal assembly and to put whatever it was that he had produced before them for consideration. If the men assembled liked the proposal, the chief would surely implement it. If they did not like it however, he would more often than not either scrap his plans or modify them to make them more agreeable to his subjects, though he was not legally bound to do so. This was perhaps due to the Tswana's unique political culture, which among other things, emphasized that the ""Chief is Chief by grace of his tribe,"" a sentiment which certainly does not encourage unilateral domestic policy implementation. In the early days the kgotla acted effectively as a means of indirect participation in Tswanan government and to ensure “competent leadership”  [4]The British had chosen to leave the traditional government in place partly because they were so effective at keeping things running smoothly. The stability had come at a steep price though. While their support did help the Chiefs maintain political stability in the region it inadvertently degraded the already somewhat specious quality of the Tswana’s only democratic institution. Chiefs no longer ruled ""by the grace of the people,"" rather they served the people at the behest of the British empire. In other words, the popular constraints (civil unrest, disobedience, and general noncooperation) that had kept their tribal sovereigns in line were neutered by foreign money and military support.  [5]  Still the tribes managed to survive and eventually became the Independent Republic of Botswana in 1966. With the advent of representative democracy came the central bureaucracy which greatly diminished the powers of the old tribal chiefs. Today, kgotla meetings are still held but due to several factors (including an across the board decline in civic participation) are sparsely attended.

 How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making 
 Although the size and scope of the tribal assemblies varied depending on the type of meeting as well as its subject, they all had the same basic format. The chief, his family, and his advisers sat in front of the assembly which would be seated around them in a semi-circle. Other than that there was no set seating arrangement. Once seated, the chief would tell those in attendance his purpose for calling them all together. He would then relinquish the floor to his advisers and trusted headmen (elite political figures) who were charged with opening the debate. After the administrative elites had stated their own positions, the rest of the body was invited to ask questions and discuss the issue. Speakers were given unlimited time to deliver thoughts, criticisms, and to ask questions to every participant including government officials. If more than one participant wished to speak, precedence was given to the most aged and socially prominent one among or between them. 
 When the discussion died out, senior headmen and other political elites would again elucidate upon their own opinions. After hearing his officials' perspectives, the chief would announce his own decision on whatever issue they had been considering to the entire assembly, and thus conclude the meeting.

 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 Theoretically, these meetings could have been extremely deliberative. Participants were technically permitted to speak their minds to the open assembly and respond to the questions and to the comments of others without restriction. They were given complete and unadulterated access to policy makers whom they could bombard with questions and complaints. Since the ruling elites' goal was to convince the people to support the official policy, they would endeavor to respond to criticisms and answer any questions that were presented to them. Ideally, this “back-and-forth” between both sides would continue until the chief felt that the matter was settled and announced his decision, taking into account the assembly's values and their overall assessment of the law. In some ways these meetings resembled a deliberative public meeting, in theory at least. In practice however, it is unlikely they were very deliberative. 
 Even though all men could sit in the kgotla and in some cases were actually forced to attend the event, they were not all able to participate. According to E. H. Ashton, men in subordinate positions would ""scarcely have the right, and seldom the temerity, to speak"" during the proceedings and that even if they managed to pluck up the courage and attempted to discuss the issue with the assembly ""no one would pay much attention to what they said.”  [7]  Deliberative public meetings make sure that all participants have the opportunity to speak. This clearly was not the case in the chief’s kgotla during such assemblies. 
 Another potentially anti-deliberative element of the actual meetings was the fact that although the chief did not state his official position, it was commonly known that he and his advisers had spent a lot of time discussing the issue in private and that therefore the positions of those advisors (which were included in the opening discussions) were probably shared by the chief as well. As a result many dissenters were kept quiet by the awareness that if they raised objections against the ideas of the advisers they could also be attacking the plans of the chief himself. [8]  So not only were minorities and other ""undesirables"" kept out of the discussion, but older, more prominent men were also discouraged from contributing to the assembly if their opinions went against what was assumed to be the status quo. In order for a public meeting to be deliberative it must allow participants to discuss different solutions and weigh them against others. Indirectly silencing dissent in such a manner would obviously impede this kind of analysis. In fact, there is evidence that suggests the meetings were used primarily by the chief to convince his subjects to go along with his proposals, rather than to deliberate on the problem his proposal was supposed to solve.  [9]Even if the chief happened to be interested in considering the faults of his own favored proposal along with the strengths of alternative solutions, he would still have to be present at the actual event, which from a deliberative stand point was not a good place for him to be. In fact, his presence, while theoretically helping to facilitate an informative discussion between ruler and subject, might have actually impeded the body’s deliberation. In Tswana culture, the chief was a highly respected figure among the people. Thus many men may have chosen to stay quiet in spite of their objections to the Chief’s proposals. Deliberative public meetings require that officials are able to hear the “authentic” and “unfiltered” opinions of the public. [10]  However, because of the people’s aforementioned veneration of their chiefs, it is unlikely (except in cases where the proposal and/or the chief himself was unpopular) that they would actually voice disagreement with any proposals that seemed contrary to his will. Though it is important to remember that there were cases in which the assembly aggressively resisted the proposals of their ruler. For instance, in 1940s, an unpopular chief was dethroned by an angry throng of kgotla participants after he tried to keep the position from his nephew (the rightful heir) after ruling in his place for a while during the boy's youth.  [11]It is also important to note that all of the discussion that occurred during this event occurred before the entire assembly. So even if a man was of the dominant tribal association and of a high status, his anxiety over addressing such a large group may have kept him from speaking his mind. The historical record makes no mention of the assembly having any special system for encouraging reluctant speakers to stand before the crowd. They did not split up into smaller groups as is necessary for deliberative public meetings. 
 At the end of the assembly the chief was expected to announce his decision in light of the assembly's discussions. He took neither poll nor vote (although he could request that they arrange themselves by ward so he could discern each area’s stance on whatever they had been discussing. [12] ) In theory, the chief would choose the position with the most support of his people and modify proposals that were not as popular. Even though he was under no legal obligation to obey the will of his subjects, the chief knew that he could not govern without the cooperation of his people. Thus, in the early days at least, these meetings had some deliberative elements as the chief was forced to incorporate the values of his subjects into his decrees as well as consider other ways of solving any problems he had wished to solve with his original proposal. 
 One core issue that would have flat out prevented the assemblies from being truly deliberative public meetings was their complete exclusion of women. Cultural concerns aside, women were still part of their society (ie “the public”) and since the goal of any deliberative public meeting is to facilitate a dialogue between public officials and citizens  [13] , their absence would obviously harm the process’s deliberative potential, if not kill it outright. Public meetings that do not allow a significant proportion of the public to participate cannot be very deliberative, no matter how informative and lively their discussions are.

They can be used by neighborhoods, school districts, counties and cities, as well as other organizations and larger regions.  These programs meet regularly over a certain period of time, which can last from weeks to months, to engage and further refine a public issue. The final product of these discussions is to actively brainstorm a variety of solutions and assess the strengths and weaknesses of those solutions in a final large group discussion. Meetings are guided by a neutral facilitator who refrains from imposing their opinions or expertise on the group.  Study circles aim to incorporate the diverse backgrounds of the community’s constituents and encourage participants to respectfully consider the views and values of fellow members. They also seek to foster social networks between people and uncover new and thoughtful methods of addressing public concerns.[1]  Origins and Development  In 1912, the concept of modern day study circles emerged in Sweden after the first study association, ABF, was established. Study associations were created to address issues related to popular movements, such as the temperance and Free Church movements, or other community concerns, such as farmers’ and white-collar workers’ rights. The main purpose of study circles in Sweden is to increase citizen participation and boost social solidarity.[4]  In 1989, the Paul J. Aicher Foundation (formerly known as the Topsfield Foundation), a U.S. nonprofit organization that advances deliberative democracy, established the Study Circles Resource Center (SCRC) to promote the use of  dialogue-to-change  programs in the U.S. Later, the SCRC would become the organization known as  Everyday Democracy . Everyday Democracy has published numerous “How-To” reference guides for individuals creating their own study circle programs. They also publish news of previous and current examples of study circles used in U.S. neighborhoods and communities. Today, many people use the study circle model offered by the SCRC.[5]  For example, Australia has considered implementing study circles in local areas. The concept was introduced in the 1980s and received growing interest in the late 1990s. The organization Adult Learning Australia (ALA) coined the term “Learning Circles Australia” and has published and circulated various pamphlets encouraging the use of study circles. ALA has also suggested that study circles be used to discuss topics such as land-care issues and Aboriginal reconciliation.[6]  Participant Recruitment and SelectionKnow how participants are recruited for this method?Help us complete this section!How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  An initial working group meets to discuss its goals for the study circle program. The group then creates a team of coordinators and delegates specific duties and responsibilities as needed. The team chooses an issue or problem currently faced by the community, which will become the main topic for the study circle discussions. Discussion guides and materials are made as necessary. Coordinators decide the geographic region subject to recruitment of participants. They also select and train facilitators for the study circles. A written plan is composed, which details the structure, schedule, and location of the study circle sessions. Budgeting and fundraising preparations are also made at this time. Sometimes, outside resources are consulted or requested.[2]  Each program begins with a ‘kickoff’ session in which participants participate in ice-breaking activities and get acquainted with each other. During this time, the goals and purposes, as well as the structure and schedule, of the study circles are introduced and described in some detail. The first few sessions allow participants to discuss their values in light of the issue and share any personal experiences, in small groups. The next few meetings, also done in small groups, are designed to examine key arguments surrounding the issue. These arguments, for example, can be for or against a policy change or simply highlight the concerns that participants may have concerning the issue. The last few meetings allow for small groups to brainstorm potential solutions that take into consideration the views, values, and concerns discussed in previous meetings. Afterwards, all of the small groups reconvene in a final large group discussion that narrows the list of ideas into several proposed solutions for the community.[3]  Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsKCK Study CirclesThe Kansas City, Kansas (KCK) school district has been confronted with a number of issues, including low parent involvement and student test scores well below the national average. Also, many immigrant families, having increased recently, often found it difficult to transition both academically and culturally to the school systems in Kansas City. The northeastern side of the city particularly faced obstacles such as low income and high unemployment rates, which translated into minimal parent involvement in public schools.  In 1999, Brandi Fisher, program director for KCK Study Circles, and her colleagues adopted the methodology provided by the SCRC. They printed flyers and made announcements for the program, inviting parents to participate by sharing their views and values. Fisher also reached out to neighborhood organizations and churches to help support KCK school reform. In order to attract more participants, the study circle was held at community centers and churches to help parents who found it uncomfortable to visit their child’s school. School administrators and city council members were excluded for the first few sessions to prevent parents from feeling intimidated. The main goals of the KCK Study Circles were to educate parents on ways that they could help their children succeed but also to allow parents to make their own goals, judgments, and agenda regarding school reform.  The structure of the KCK Study Circles included three sessions of small group discussion with each group consisting of between eight and twelve participants. During the first session, parents shared personal experiences concerning their own education. In the second session, parents proposed various ideas for improving schools and weighed the strengths and weaknesses of those potential solutions. Finally, in the third session, parents participated in an “action forum” in which they organized into teams, shared their conclusions and worked on specific solution proposals.  Since the first KCK Study Circles program, there have been over one hundred meetings, and about 10 percent of the northeast Kansas City population (about 1,676 people) have attended these sessions. Over time, discussion topics have evolved from being strictly about schools and education to city-wide issues such as crime and racism. Overall, the program has been largely successful, particularly because it allows its participants, as opposed to organizers and facilitators, to choose the agenda and topics of discussion. Furthermore, reforms in education have taken place, such as organizing parent support groups, tutoring and mentoring opportunities, and school fundraising events.[7]Buffalo Policing CirclesTense relations between the police and teenagers of Buffalo, N.Y. have made it difficult for community members to reach a common ground in terms of law enforcement, crime prevention, and neighborhood safety. Lack of trust and respect between the police and youth has amplified community stress, sometime escalating to dangerous police-youth confrontations.  In 2000, the Margaret L. Wendt Foundation and United Way of Buffalo and Erie County started the United Neighborhoods Center in Buffalo, which worked to foster better relations between the police and teenagers. United Neighbors received funding from the Department of Justice and was best known for its problem-solving initiatives. Over 250 youth participated in the study circles in Buffalo. Some objectives of the program included engaging youth in discussing police-community relations and addressing the issue of racial profiling.  Youth from various organizations and clubs formed teams with police and other community members. These teams met during facilitated events where they were provided discussion guides with sample questions and various viewpoints concerning police-community relations and racial profiling. In order to attract more participants, rap and hip-hop events, drama performances, and games were incorporated into the small group events to encourage conversation and idea-sharing. At one of the events, teenagers and police played a game modeled after Family Feud, called “Community Feud,” to break down existing tensions between the two parties.[8]  The study circles allowed the teams to pinpoint issues underlying police-teen conflicts. The participants realized that teens had minimal outlets for after-school activities and thus used parties as entertainment venues, which were often linked to substance abuse and violence. Angela Jones, program coordinator for the Buffalo Policing Circles, noted some proposed solutions to this issue, including planned meetings to educate teens on rules and guidelines for hosting safe parties. The study circles were successful because they increased policing programs, which resulted in faster response times for 911 calls. However, cuts in police funding and the United Neighborhoods coordinator’s moving to a different community prevented improvements from becoming substantial and permanent.[9]SwedenThe use of study circles has been an enduring tradition for Sweden since 1912. It is often considered a “mass phenomenon” because nearly 2 million citizens participate in one or more study circle programs per year. Study associations or organizations often receive funding from the state government and are accountable for promoting and facilitating study circles. In addition, they are responsible for reporting numbers and statistics relating to the study circles. In the early 1900s, common topics for discussion included workers’ rights, the temperance movement, and Free Church movement. However, more recently topics have proven to cover a large spectrum and can depend on the will of coordinator. Some study circles even discuss poetry or certain crafts, though these circles are generally organized by any person with a particular cultural interest as opposed to a study association. Usually participants meet for three hours on one day every week for 10 to 15 meetings.  Though study associations have faced difficulty in measuring the quality and success of these study circles, it is widely understood that many Swedes participate in at least one program per year and far more participating in several. Also, they have been successful in encouraging all age brackets to get involved, including young adults.[10]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Study circles have been particularly beneficial in fostering community bonds and social solidarity. In the case of the KCK Study Circles, people of diverse backgrounds were able to reach a common ground because they decided their agenda and freely discussed their views, values, and concerns. Networking amongst parents increased, which helped parent involvement in schools and children’s education.[11]  Particularly in Sweden, study circles have often been used to increase literacy amongst citizens. By emphasizing speech as a feature of literacy, study circles offered those lacking formal education a venue for learning language and civic participation. A striking quality found within Swedish study circles is that they are used by half of the state’s population, which proves that study circles can advance the significance of citizen involvement.[12]  The quality of deliberation in a study circles program depends on the dynamics of the group. Some participants may be passive while others are more outspoken. This prevents some voices from being heard, and sometimes speaking opportunities are not equally distributed. Furthermore, the diversity of the group may hinder participants from reaching any consensus, especially if members come from very different backgrounds. If consensus becomes a serious issue, participants may drop out from the group altogether.[13]  Leadership is another primary factor in assessing the success of study circles. If the facilitator does not perform his or her duties properly, the discussions may be too heavily influenced by the facilitator or fail to provide organization and structure. In the case of the Buffalo Policing Circles, the head coordinator’s moving to a different community prevented the program from achieving long-lasting success.[14]  See AlsoPortsmouth Listens Everyday Democracy Strong Starts for Children (Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA)   References  [1] ↑ Sarah vL.

189,method,Local Democracy Week (Europe),https://participedia.net/method/189,The Local Democracy Week is an annual process of events held in Europe to foster local and national participation. ,0,2010-12-07,2022-07-15,285,Mooreram,https://participedia.net/user/285,421204,"""Nina Sartor""",https://participedia.net/user/421204,en,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,international,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Problems and Purpose 
 The European Local Democracy Week (ELDW) is an annual process of events held in Europe to foster local and national participation. The process was developed as a way to increase public knowledge of local democracy and local democratic participation. Founded in 2007, this relatively new event occurs every year around October 15th to commemorate the European Charter of Local Self-Government, which was signed on that date in 1985. ELDW is a joint initiative of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities and the European Committee on Local and Regional Democracy. During the 2010 ELDW over 4000 towns, cities and villages in European countries participated by offering a number of events and activities open to citizens. 
 Overall ELDW seeks to emphasize the importance of local democracy in constructing a democratic Europe and to inform the public and elected representatives how crucial their participation in local affairs is in maintaining a strong local democracy. 
 Through the events and activities of the ELDW elected representatives and leaders are given a special opportunity to bring local government closer to citizens. Throughout the week they focus on informing citizens of how they operate and what their competences are through direct and close contact, furthermore increasing citizen confidence in them. Local elected representatives and leaders take this opportunity to listen to citizens and discuss subjects of local interest. They inform citizens of various ways to get involved with local government while gaining themselves a better understanding of what the citizens what and need. 
 ELDW provides citizens a chance to get to know their councilors and what their responsibilities are. They get the opportunity to ask their leaders questions and to be listened to. The ELDW aims for citizens to walk away from the week knowing how the local democratic intuitions managing their lives operate and about the various opportunities available for taking part in democratic life at the local level. 
 The Council of Europe The Council of Europe uses ELDW as a marketing tool to promote local democracy as the basis for building a strong democratic society. Through national media campaigns and the exposure the week gets at the local level, the hope is to reinforce citizens’ perception of local democracy as a common European value. 
 Origins and Development 
 At the time of the development of the ELDW there were already several existing local democracy events in member states. For example, the Local Government Association of the United Kingdom was already established and had been organizing a “Local Democracy Week” for seven years in England and Wales. In 2006 a Joint Working Group consisting of the European Committee on Local and Regional Democracy (CDLR) and the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities was established at the Council of Europe. They felt that organizing local events across the continent with the common label of “European Local Democracy Week” would help citizens understand local democracy as a common European value and a necessity for the construction of a democratic society. With this shared view the Congress and CDLR members of the Working Group initiated the ELDW and promoted the project in their respective member states, obtaining a generally positive reception. On October 15-16 in 2007 the first ELDW was officially launched at the 15th session of the Ministerial Conference of European Ministers Responsible for Local and Regional Government. Since then the event has expanded to over 4000 European cities, towns and villages. It will continue to be promoted as a “pan-European” event aiming to encourage even more local authorities to join in.

 How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making 
 Local authorities may organize different events with their citizens and elected representatives during the second week of October when the ELDW is officially held. 
 City councils, provincial authorities and regions can choose to contribute to ELDW in two main ways: 1. Applying as a partner of ELDW, organizing its own initiatives involving citizens and other local partners. 2. Co-operating with participating local authorities by promoting the institutional logo, supporting their initiatives financially or providing other resource (printing leaflets, providing equipment, printing ELDW posters) 
 Local institutions who choose to partner with the ELDW organize a variety of activities and events best suiting their area. Types of events include information/communication activities such as forums on local development, production of information material on local authorities, producing an information campaign in the local media, or a special issue of the local authority’s newsletter that focuses on local democracy and the ELDW. 
 Also held are activities based on exchanges between citizens and local elected representatives like public debates on topics of local interest, lectures on local democracy followed by discussion, meetings and discussions between local elected representatives and community associations, local authority open days, and allowing citizens to visit facilities (i.e. fire stations, schools) run by local authorities. 
 Young people are believed to play an essential role in spreading message ELDW. The participation of youth and children in the week is strongly encouraged through a variety of activities and events. Activities for youth include the organization of a youth council/parliament to discuss issues relevant to young people, visits to local institutions, school visits by elected representatives, mock elections and a variety of other games and events designed to give young people perspective on the life, community and how participating in local democracy can affect them. 
 Typically these types of events are planned over the preceding year and held all throughout the second week of October when the ELDW is officially celebrated. Although, some local institutions choose to use only a few days out of the week to hold events or choose to celebrate the week at another point in the year more opportunity for the community. 
 Influence, Outcomes, and Effects 
 Through the events held, citizens became more deliberative, especially in the case of forums, debates and other activities which allowed citizens to interact with each other and elected officials (such as the Harvering, London events). The information learned through information/communication activities also ensures future deliberation is more effective. 
 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 The following lessons were drawn from observation of the 2010 ELDW: 
 At the local level examples of ELDW vary, but many local authorities could make improvements by holding more events and putting more effort into the week. The regions that take the time to do a lot of planning such as Northern Ireland had a very successful week that youth, adults and even government walked away from having benefited greatly. 
 At the level of the Council of Europe improvements can be made by more promotion of the week. The organizers of the week did an exceptional job getting over 47 countries to participate, but that means they have to market the week extra hard to countries that still haven’t made the effort. They might consider taking their promotion to a local level as some countries have committed to celebrating the week but specific local governments of that country choose not to hold events.

Juries exists to prevent “oppression by the government,"" which is supported by the presumption of innocence.  Juries are not meant to make assumptions about topics not brought up by either the defence or prosecution, but rather make their conclusion/verdict based on information provided. They cannot use their own judgments and opinions. In the United States, each selected juror goes through voir dire, meaning “to say the truth”, in order to make sure that there are no links between jurors and people involved in the trial. For example, a person who was preliminarily selected to be part of a jury will be disqualified or removed if they know the defendant or plaintiff. Lawyers generally want juries who are not legally educated, as juries who don't know the legal systems are more easily manipulated. Furthermore jurors that have too much legal knowledge might be disqualified from participating.  Origins and Development  Juries date back to ancient Greece. For instance, the famous trial of Socrates' involved higher status citizens  expressing concerns for Athenian youth because they thought Socrates was corrupting them. There were anywhere from six to 501 members of the jury.  In Great Britain in the 14th century, a jury had to reach unanimous decision in criminal cases with 12 members. It was common to incarcerate the jury without food and water until verdict was reached. Jurors were prosecuted if later evidence demonstrated error in verdict. In 1852, Lord Chief Justice Loke developed choosing a jury as it is today.Participant Recruitment and Selection  The US Constitution provides the 6th amendment which entitles citizens the right to a jury trial. Juries must have 6-12 members, as less than 6 is unconstitutional. In civil courts, there are usually six members and in criminal courts, there are usually twelve members. However, this number will differ from country to country and in different court structures. The jury is selected from different demographics to represent a country, state or city.  How it Works: Process, Interaction and Decision-Making  As Dr. John Gastil noted in his book,  Political Communication and Deliberation , jurors do deliberate fairly well. Most of the  deliberation  happens in the court when jurors listen to evidence and witnesses. The assertion of self-deliberation then reestablishes in the jury room when jurors began to deliberate.  Robert Goodin, an Australian philosopher, documented that jurors start deliberating within as they watch a trial. So even before coming into the room to deliberate as a group, they already have a sense of the verdict. One of the findings about jurors is that 90% of the time they already have deliberated and have a good idea of the verdict as they process each evidence and witness on the spot [ citation needed ]  There are two distinct deliberation processes: one is verdict-driven while the other is evidence-driven. Most cases are evidence driven deliberation where the jury is actually going piece by piece, evidence by evidence, and witness by witness to come to the conclusion. In contrast, for verdict driven, the deliberation views how many jurors have arrived at a verdict.  Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsKnow what outcomes and effects this method typically has?

Direct democratic instruments in modern democracies include referendums, plebiscites, and citizens' initiatives.",0,2010-12-08,2022-05-05,2170,quentinto,https://participedia.net/user/2170,134860,"""Lucy J Parry Participedia Team""",https://participedia.net/user/134860,en,0,both,empower,open,,moderate,moderate,direct,,,no_limit, large,,national, regional,,express, discussion,,voting,,,majoritarian, supermajoritarian,make,,," Problems and Purpose  Direct democracy can be understood in contrast to  representative democracy , where representatives are authorized through public elections to represent the interests of their constituencies. In direct democracies, in comparison, all citizens directly participate in deciding public matters.  The Ancient Greek  polis democracy  in Athens is often referred to as ideal of a direct democracy. Although it excluded women and unfree men (slaves), all those with citizen status publicly gathered on the agora (a public place in the city centre) and  deliberated  political issues, held speeches and finally decided political matters. When political communities started to grow in scale (from cities to modern nation states), new participatory modes needed to be invented to fulfill participatory promises of democracy on a large scale. Liberal democracies emerged through new forms of parliamentarism in Great Britain and the United States of America in the 18th century, which transformed the concept of democracy from direct participation to representation. Anarchist and socialist models of democracy, however, tried to realize direct democracy on a larger scale and practiced concepts of delegation in  council democracies . Here delegates from councils at the local level would be sent to councils at the regional and from there to the federal level in a kind of pyramid strucutre with imperative (binding) mandates in contrast to liberal democracies free mandates.  Today the term  direct democracy  is mostly associated with direct democratic mechanisms like  referenda , plebiscites, and  citizens' initiatives . As Switzerland employs these tools much more frequently in comparison with any other democratic state, it is often referred to as direct democracy. Most scientists, however, agree that Switzerland should be understood as semi-direct democracy as it employs direct democratic instruments within a representative democratic system. Thus the idea of direct democracy has shifted from an understanding close to the meaning of  participatory democracy  in the Ancient Greek polis democracies to campaigns involving the  collections of signatures  and a voting act in order to influence the policies of representative governments. However, more recently, discussions about  electronic, digital or cyberdemocracy  have revived the direct democratic ideal in its broad participatory sense as the availability of electronic means of communication make political decisions possible for everyone, at any times, in any place.  The following are some types of direct democratic instruments. They can either be implemented on the local, state, or regional level.Constitutional  referendum : Some changes in the constitutions of countries that have great effect on the political system of the state, need to undergo a public referendum.  Advisory Referendum (non-binding): The legislature can initiate a referendum. Its outcome is not binding but serves to advise the government.  Citizens' initiative: Citizens gather a certain among of signatures which results in a voting act, in which further citizens can express their support. If the votes cast on this day plus the original signatures collected to initiate the vote exceed a certain threshold, the matter needs to be discussed, but not decided upon, by parliament.  Citizens' initiative referendum/plebiscite: This referendum is initiated by citizens through the collection of a certain number of signatures. The voting act results in a binding decision.  Recall referendum: Citizens initiate the removal from office of an elected official through the gathering of signatures and a subsequent referendum.Origins and Development  The earliest known direct democracy is said to be the Athenian democracy in 5th century BC, although it was not an inclusive democracy: women, foreigners, and slaves were excluded from it. The main bodies of Athenian democracy were the assembly, composed of male citizens; the boulê, composed of 500 citizens; and the law courts, composed of a massive number of jurors chosen by lot, with no judges. There were only about 30,000 male citizens, but several thousand of them were politically active in each year, and many of them quite regularly for years on end. Athenian democracy was direct not only in the sense that decisions were made by the assembled people, but also in the sense that the people through the assembly, boulê, and law courts controlled the entire political process and a large proportion of citizens were involved constantly in the public business. Modern democracies, being representative, not direct, do not resemble the Athenian system.  Also relevant to the history of direct democracy is the history of Ancient Rome, specifically the Roman Republic, beginning around 509 BC. Rome displayed many aspects of democracy, both direct and indirect, from the era of Roman monarchy all the way to the collapse of the Roman Empire. Indeed, the Senate, formed in the first days of the city, lasted through the Kingdom, Republic, and Empire, and even continued after the decline of Western Rome; and its structure and regulations continue to influence legislative bodies worldwide. As to direct democracy, the ancient Roman Republic had a system of citizen lawmaking, or citizen formulation and passage of law, and a citizen veto of legislature-made law. Many historians mark the end of the Republic with the passage of a law named the Lex Titia, 27 November 43 BC, which eliminated many oversight provisions.  Modern-era citizen lawmaking began in Swiss towns in the 13th century. In 1847, the Swiss added the ""statute referendum"" to their national constitution. They soon discovered that merely having the power to veto Parliament's laws was not enough. In 1891, they added the ""constitutional amendment initiative"". Swiss politics since 1891 have given the world a valuable experience base with the national-level constitutional amendment initiative. In the past 120 years, more than 240 initiatives have been put to referendums. The populace has been conservative, approving only about 10% of these initiatives; in addition, they have often opted for a version of the initiative rewritten by government.  Some of the issues surrounding the related notion of direct democracy using the  Internet and other communications technologies  are dealt with in e-democracy and below under the term electronic direct democracy. More concisely, the concept of open source governance applies principles of the free software movement to the governance of people, allowing the entire populace to participate in government directly, as much or as little as they please.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Direct democratic participation is generally open to all with citizen status and who are above the voting age. Citizenship, however, is often restricted as the example of the Ancient Greek polis democracy proves. Today many migrants, who live in their new home countries for many years, are still restricted from voting. Many countries also deprive convicted felons from voting rights.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The deliberative character of direct democracy has changed quite a lot over the millennia. In the Ancient Greek polis democracy, all those with citizen status gathered and discussed and decided on political matters directly. Poleis were small and decentralized enough to make the face-to-face engagement of all formal citizens possible. This ideal is still preserved in some Swiss cantons, where citizens of a village gather and deliberate face-to-face.  In large-scale modern democracies, this is not possible. That does not mean, however, that  deliberation  does not take place. During referendum campaigns or in the process of gathering signatures for  petitions , citizens deliberate in smaller, more private circles, with their friends and families. Print media and television yield enormous power in this process as they mediate what is said by experts and politicians to ""ordinary citizens"". This channel mostly works one way: top-down.  Social media  like Facebook and Twitter make the interaction of citizens with a greater—while still restricted and selective—public possible. Posting or commenting on political content is a way of deliberative political engagement that differs from traditional forms in many ways: messages tend to be shorter and more visualized and the audience does not include all citizens but a selected group usually encompassing a couple of hundred people. Nevertheless, new media has opened new channels of horizontal communication in contrast with old media.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Many direct democracy advocates complain about high quantitative barriers like quotas that keep referenda from succeeding. Moreover, in many countries, referenda can only be initiated by governments, not by citizens. Nevertheless, direct democratic instruments appear to have an effect on how democratic systems work. The easier it is for citizens and oppositional parties to initiate referenda or petitions, the more governments appear responsive to citizens' interests even  before  such direct democratic instruments are employed. The effect of anticipatory obedience, while always present to a certain extent in modern democracies as elected office holders are afraid to be punished at elections, is enhanced through instruments of direct democracy. So even while many referendum initiatives fail either because not enough signatures can be gathered in the time provided or not enough citizens take part in the voting act of the referendum (quorum) or not enough citizens vote in favour of the suggested initiative, modern democracies employing direct democratic mechanisms appear to be more democratic than those without.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  While the positive aspects of direct democratic instruments become apparent in the descriptions above, criticism is uttered as well:Modern direct democratic tools are often ""high jacked"" and instrumentalized by oppositional parties or even by government parties who face strong opposition either from their coalition partners or from other societal actors (economic elite, lobbies etc.). In these cases, direct democratic instruments do not serve citizens to express their will vis-a-vis the elected government anymore, but they serve oppositional parties aiming to increase their success at the next elections.  In referendum campaigns, the media, and thus big corporations with their own political interests, play a big role. Political content in the deliberative process during the campaign is mediated through newspapers, television, radio, and the internet. If influential newspapers or TV stations campaign for a specific decision, this can influence the outcome of the referendum.  In such campaigns, emotional, concise and easily comprehensible arguments—even if factually wrong—often prove more decisive than more complicated arguments. Fears often prevail.See AlsoIndonesian Direct Democracy ExperimentReferencesThis entry is missing citations.

 Demarchy (or lottocracy) is a form of government in which the state is governed by randomly selected decision makers who have been selected by  sortition  (lot) from a broadly inclusive pool of eligible citizens. These groups, sometimes termed policy juries,  citizens' juries , or  consensus conferences , deliberately make decisions about public policies in much the same way that juries decide criminal cases. 
 Demarchy, in theory, could overcome some of the functional problems of conventional representative democracy, which is widely subject to manipulation by special interests and a division between professional policymakers (politicians and lobbyists) vs. a largely passive, uninvolved and often uninformed electorate. According to Australian philosopher John Burnheim, random selection of policymakers would make it easier for everyday citizens to meaningfully participate, and harder for special interests to corrupt the process.

It is perhaps the most direct form of citizen participation in policy making and certainly the oldest.[1]  The right to representation is at the foundation of liberal democracy. Petitions are thus one of the most important ways citizens have to make their voices heard and their desires known. While elections give citizens a say over  who  will represent them in government, petitions ensure  what representatives do aligns with those constituents' interests. While the ability to vote an official out of office gives citizens some measure of control, elections are held infrequently, often every four to five years. Petitions may be submitted at any time, thus giving citizens a relatively unrestricted channel of voice and agency.

Magic roundtables allow participants to track how many times they and other members have spoken. As well, each speaking turn is kept to around five minutes which lets other participants know who has spoken the most and who still needs to have their say.  Origins and Development  The Magic Rountable technique was developed by Farah Lenser and Heiner Benking who run 'Open-Forum.de' which is part of the Anna Lindh Foundation - ""the largest Network of civil society organisations involved in the promotion of intercultural dialogue across Europe and the Mediterranean.""  How it Works  Magic roundtables are a deliberative technique so are rarely employed on their own. Instead, roundtables are often part of a larger method and are used during the  deliberation  phase to generate and sustain conversation and deliberation. The selection of participants is therefore dependent on the method within which the roundtables are used.The following has been translated from the original and can be found athttp://open-forum.de/magic-roundtable.pdf""Each person is given an equal number of beads, stones, or any tokens representing equal units of time. The total meeting time is divided into units matching the distributed tokens, thus valuing them. Each member then introduces her/himself, and if so desired, offers a topic for dialogue. Members then give tokens to others whose proposal or offer the group wants to enlarge from the selection offered in order to empower voices and joint interests, enlarge the flow in dialogue. This ""voting or encouraging"" continues as topics generate more or less ""empathy"" or concern; and as others join in the conversation can receive tokens as encouragement to continue with their line of thought. This open, transparent format can encourage inhibited people to participate and minimize domination by authoritarian types. In case of unexpected changes in meeting duration, the tokens can be re-/de-valued inflated/deflated to match the remaining available time. This method is one approach being highlighted in this paper:  http://www.open-forum.de/time-sharing.html  which might provide some general orientation.  In the case of a pre-selection of one hour total time and twelve persons involved in the conversation, five minutes of speaking time are symbolized in the form of time units symbolized by spoons, straws, stones, noodles, nuts or the like to each person.  After a short introductory session in which each person sketches briefly their concerns, these time units can be given away and thus converted into listening time. As a rule, the person with the most time units opens the conversation. She can talk as long as she has time or the others signal her by additional time gifts that she wants to continue listening. Imagine the ""time loan"" as a redestate of ice, it melts as soon as one speaks, and thus it becomes visible to everyone whether the speaker still has speaking time available.  A moderator takes care of the time and observance of the rules. Visible to all, consumed time units takes on themselves or asks to place them in the middle. Once a person has used up his or her speech time, that is, there are no more time units, the others - if they are interested - can give their own speaking time as a listening time, thus encouraging the person to further develop their theme.  In this way, the conversation remains dynamic and transparent. There are no fixed time limits for speaking as in the usual discussion groups, but listening is recognized as an active part of the conversation and as a special quality. The content corresponds to the interest of the entire group at this time and in this place. In this game, a person can also receive the entire speaking time, if at the moment it becomes the medium or catalyst of the entire group, and if the participants so wish.""  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The flexible structure of the roundtables allows participants to be given votes of encouragement to continue speaking on topics that generate more or less empathy or concern. This open, transparent format can encourage inhibited people to participate and minimize domination by authoritarian types. Deliberations using this method can thus draw out opinions or ideas that would have otherwise remained unheard.

 Problems and Purpose 
 The Airesis platform is built around the principles of direct democracy and non-profit. It was developed by volunteers in Italy and is free to use. According to its website, the platform is based on the following principles: Participation : Involving citizens means having more energy and points of view available. Only through direct participation it is possible to investigate the problems and understand what people really want. Participation is the essence of democratic decisions. Transparency and Security : Without transparency, rules can be easily circumvented and democracy can quickly degenerate. Transparency also means openness, ability to receive: for this reasons Airesis also allows unregistered users to view the contents of the site. The source code of the software is also ""transparent"", being it entirely open source. Constructive dialogue : No one owns all the right answers. Using appropriate tools, elaborating ideas proposed by many people can be more productive than doing it yourself. Equal opportunities :To be intended as how effective equality, in terms of offered possibilities, can be pursued by the system. Flexibility : Each group has its own needs, each proposal is different from the others, each user has their own needs. Origins and Development 
 Aireses is a fusion of two e-democracy projects: Agora 2.0 and DemocracyOnline. The Agora 2.0 project began as a small group in 2009 and soon expanded to over 200 volunteers. In 2012, Agora 2.0 and DemocracyOnline were combined and was relaunched as Airesis. A year later, its founders established the Democratic Technologies Association (""Tecnologie Democratiche"") to secure funding and support for the platform's continued development. 
 How it Works 
 Participation will vary according to the needs of each project. 
 The platform has a number of tools for the discussion and evaluation of proposals. An author can put forward a proposal for debate that others can edit and comment on. Participants can also decide when and if a proposal is sufficiently developed to be voted on. Once a proposal passes a certain threshold whereby participants deem it to be ready for voting, another tool enables voting using the Schulze method. During voting a proposal cannot be edited anymore. Users can also choose whether the debate and voting is anonymised or not. Proposals can be made public and published on social media, or be kept private by the lead user.

 Problems and Purpose 
 The Wikivote tool was developed by a Russian company Wikivote. It is based on a wiki approach to document composition. Project participants treat the the document, such as a law or a regulations as a construction kit, consisting of blocks, which can be discussed, evaluated and modified. The platform attracts the open network community to participating in creative and collaborative problem solving. The spectrum of possible implications extends from simple actions, such as collecting and re-use of existing knowledge and content objects, links etc. to solving complex tasks of creating collaborative documents, standards, books etc. This methodology helps to select the most appropriate and meaningful suggestions on the content of the document. The voting mechanism allows to rate the suggestions and calculate the ranking of every participant. Participants’ votes and the ranking systems help to manage the information noise. Related methods and tools are  Liquid Democracy ,  Deebase ,  ConsiderIt ,  Electronic Direct Democracy ,  e-Deliberation  , and  Online Voting .

 How it Works 
 Step 1. The initial draft of the bill is put together by a legislative committee, consisting of a limited number of professional legislators. It generally reflects the previous version of the bill, if any and amendments made by the legislators themselves. The initial draft if passed to the Wikivote team. Step 2. The draft document is decomposed into segments is published on the platform. For example laws are decomposed into items. Step 3. Every participant can create only one version of an item. Both initial and new versions of the items are voted for and against. If a participant thinks that the item should be modified, he can create his own version of it, which in its turn, is evaluated and commented on by other participants. Step 4. Items with maximum votes are selected. All segments are rated according to the participants’ votes and a new draft of the document, approved by the community is built. At the same time the rank of the participant is calculated according to the data of his involvement. Step 5. The draft law is passed to the legislative committee who approve the most sound and reasonable suggestions. Improper and contradicting suggestions are excluded. Step 6. The second draft of the law is posted on the Wikivote platform for the final round of evaluation and consideration. The segments are voted for and commented by the participants again. Step 7. The draft law is passed to the Parliament for approval.

CBPR begins with a research topic of importance to the community, has the aim of combining knowledge with action and achieving social change to improve health outcomes and eliminate health disparities.""[1]  CBPR typically unites three parties: Government agencies, trained scientists, and citizens from the community in an effort to solve a given problem. Typically, members of the three parties meet to draw up an open and inclusive research plan that involves the whole community through questionnaires, open public meetings, or other methods. These methods are employed when a given political problem that affects the community is complex and requires a high level of expertise.  Origins and Development  The historical roots of CBPR generally trace back to the development of participatory action research by Kurt Lewin and Orlando Fals Borda, and the popular education movement in Latin America associated with Paulo Freire.  In CBPR projects, the community participates fully in all aspects of the research process. CBPR projects start with the community. Community is often self-defined, but general categories of community include geographic community, community of individuals with a common problem or issue, or a community of individuals with a common interest or goal. CBPR encourages collaboration of “formally trained research” partners from any area of expertise, provided that the researcher provides expertise that is seen as useful to the investigation by the community, and is fully committed to a partnership of equals and to producing outcomes usable to the community.  Equitable partnerships require sharing power, resources, credit, results, and knowledge, as well as a reciprocal appreciation of each partner's knowledge and skills at each stage of the project, including problem definition/issue selection, research design, conducting research, interpreting the results, and determining how the results should be used for action. CBPR differs from traditional research in many ways. One of the principal ways in which it is different is that instead of creating knowledge for the advancement of a field or for knowledge's sake, CBPR is an iterative process, incorporating research, reflection, and action in a cyclical process.

 Echo is a joint open-source project for active citizen participation.[1] Its comprehensive approach is designed to address a core problem of our time: the political resignation and feelings of powerlessness of the individual. 
 Echo is an instrument for a new kind of participatory democracy facing these challenges. Unlike usual Web 2.0 applications, Echo provides a clearly structured opinion base and allows for a solution-oriented social collaboration. It unites technical innovation and human scientific knowledge into a unique concept. Its aim is to help people better understand backgrounds and interrelations of topics, jointly make sound decisions and turn them into reality. Accordingly, echo comes with three main functional areas: Discuss – Connect – Act! 
 Origins and Development 
 How it Works 
 “Echocracy” stands for the new form of participatory democracy of echo. It aims to empower people from all over the world to jointly discuss issues of common interest and to develop and implement the best possible solutions to these issues. 
 Echo facilitates this process through a deliberative intercultural discourse, where competences from the most important segments of society are all incorporated into a collective decision making process. These segments of society are: Citizens and impacted people (with competence with regard to needs) 
 Experts and scientists (with professional competence) 
 Politicians and other representatives (with decision making competence) 
 Non-governmental and governmental organizations (with action competence &amp; mobilization potential) Analysis and Lessons Learned

 The spokes council model is a structure for democratic process that has been used within organizations and protest movements for many years. It has been employed by many organizations and struggles including the Zapatistas, Chaipas, the Women’s Movement, Anti-Nuclear Movement, and Global Justice Movement. It has also been used by Occupy Wall Street, Occupy Portland and  Occupy Vancouver.  
 The spokes council works like the spokes of a wheel. It is designed to allow for large group participation and small group discussion to work together with consensus. Each committee, caucus, or outside organization consenses on a representative, a rotating spokesperson or ‘spoke’ who meets in the middle with the other spokes for form the council. The committees, caucuses or outside organizations sit directly behind the spoke for direct consultation on decisions being made. 
 Origins and Development Know how and why this method was developed? Help us complete this section!  
 Participant Recruitment and Selection 
 Anyone can attend the Spokes Council. A Spokes Council is used as a way of organizing a movement or group, so attendees will usually be those involved with that movement. Anyone can participate in the council by joining a committee or caucus. Also new and non-affiliated members can participate in the open caucus which has a voice but no say in the Spokes Council consensus process. 
 How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making Committees  are open to everyone and can only exclude people for constant disruption or violating General Assembly Agreements. 
 A  Caucus  is a self determined group of people who share a common experience of marginalization by society at large. Outside Organizations  are organizations that have given public support to the movement and wish to collaborate on joint efforts. 
 A  spoke  is a rotating, agreed-upon representative of a committee, caucus or outside organization. Spokes are considered a neutral spokesperson, not the unilateral decision maker for the group. They should be thought of as a facilitator rather than temporary leaders. 
 The Spokes Council is made up of rotating representatives from caucuses, committees, and outside organizations. Spokes are considered neutral spokes person not the decision maker for their groups; they must share the differing views and decisions that their groups have come to consensus on with the Spokes Council. The spoke is a facilitator rather than temporary leader of their group. The spokes must rotate and can be recalled by their group at any time. 
 The function of the council is not to unilaterally make decisions for the rest of the movement. Issues are brought to the Spokes Council, the council then breaks into their respective groups to discuss the issues and come to consensus. The council then reassembles and reports the diversity of opinion and consensuses reached. A committee or caucus must send a spoke and at least two other members to the Spokes Council. 
 Dissenting voices in a committee or caucus that feel their voice is not being represented by their spoke are encouraged by the Spokes Council that try and resolve the issue within their group. If differing or dissenting opinions are not being represented in the Spokes Council, the members of the spoke’s group can show a point of process and the Spokes Council is responsible for addressing the issue. If a group feels so strongly that the spoke is misrepresenting the group’s views, the group can ‘mic check’ to interrupt the spokes council and recall their spoke.

 Analysis and Lessons Learned Note: The following analysis is the view of Occupy Vancouver's Spokes Council Working Group.Access:  The Spokes Council model creates greater access for those outside of Occupy Vancouver and within. It has been difficult to find committees and caucuses within the General Assembly. This creates a central location for people to easily find a group they wish to participate in. Transparency:  The Spokes Council enables greater communication of committee work, roles, and responsibilities. Process:  With a clear mandate to make decisions over committee work and logistical matters and because of the efficiency of the model, the Spokes Council will greatly increase the ability to make decisions and follow through on them. Marginalization:  The General Assembly is currently not an empowering model for marginalized people. The ability for marginalized groups to create a caucus and have a spoke on the council will allow for greater participation from marginalized voices. General Assembly:  Taking the logistical and committee work into the Spokes Council frees up the General Assembly to talk more about broad visioning and goal setting while at the same time opening it up for more open ended political discussion. The General Assembly remains the highest decision making body. Trust:  The General Assembly does not give participants much time to interact with one another or build meaningful relationships. A more structured environment for the group members to interact creates even more time to communicate and build relationships through continued interaction.

The management of a workplace or an enterprise comes together with the selected delegates to negotiate and bargain on issues selected by the workers to be the agenda of the discussions.  A concept that was born in the middle of the rise of communism in early 20th century Russia, its original intent was to transform the labour relations to turn production into something collectively owned by the working class. In its current-day application, it has been implemented in different scales and in varying degrees in different countries. From small-scale applications such as in smaller businesses seeking to give voice to its employees to large-scale implementations such as the European Union’s crafting of the European Works Council (EWC) [1] which, in part, serves to ensure that workers are assisted when they express desire for delegate-based representation, it has existed in different sizes. Beyond just scale, it has also served as a tool to open up different levels of participation to workers: from being just similar to collective bargaining by encouraging mere negotiations with employers to truly turning over the power of the workplace to its employees by allowing the delegates to essentially be the management team. Ultimately and in each case, it functions to increase the participation of the workers in decision-making processes that affect their employment and general matters related to their trade.  Workers' councils are related to  University Student Governments .  The creation of a workers’ council puts collective administration into the hands of the workers through their selection of temporary, revocable delegates who are answerable to the mass assembly who selected them. It seeks to reduce the separation between the majority of the workers and the decision-making processes within places of employment or enterprises by ensuring they have representatives. In some cases, the delegates are not merely negotiators but end up serving as the managing members.  Due to its socialist roots, it does endanger a more inclusive discussion among its participants as they are more likely to be polarized towards the more communist or socialist end of the spectrum. Similarly, its roots have impeded it from being received openly by less socialist societies that could potentially have been more open to increased participation from workers in workplace decision-making processes.  Origins and Development  Workers' councils first came into existence in Russia as part of the rise of communism in 1905. With the increasing focus on class struggles and giving power to the proletariat, the realization of such a world was devised in various ways. In the workplace, not only was ownership of the means of production thought to rightfully belong to the proletariat, so was the ability to decide all workplace and labour-related issues. The materialization of this within the workforce was in the form of workers' councils. It was thought that the selection of a mass assembly of temporary and revocable delegates would be the most efficient and minimally corrupt way of turning proletarian control into reality.  Outside of Russia, they rose into prominence during the German Revolution in 1918. As part of the captivation of power from the imperial government, workers and soldiers became unwilling to cooperate without a stake and a say in the new order. With the rise of Germany as a republic came the rise of workers' and soldiers' councils in Germany which gave a greater sense of involvement and participation to all through the use of delegates. [2]  Over time, the decline of communism in Europe led to the reduction of the direct management of the workers of themselves. However, the ability of workers to participate was not necessarily forgotten or devalued. In fact, in September 1994, the European Works Council was established. It ensured the right of each worker to being consulted and being informed of company decisions at the EU level through their representatives.  As of yet, the only model most similar to the original conception of this participatory method that has been used in the United States came into being in the 1920s. The Workers' Council of the United States was a faction of the Socialist Party of America. However, it was short-lived due to problems within the political party. The applications of it in modern-day America are not much different from a typical labor union.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  There are two kinds of participants that could be broken down in discussing a workers’ council. The former is the general group that takes on this method. The latter is the selection of the delegates within the workers’ council that take on the primary role of communicator between the workers and the management or, in some cases, take on the role of management.  The method allowing worker governance of and by themselves is open to all who want to adapt it. However, there are systems in place that have allowed public policy to back the creation of these councils. Particularly, the European Works Council encourages the establishment of these by mandating them for larger companies operating at the European Union level (further discussed in the Influence, Outcomes, and Effects sub-heading) and obligating smaller companies to establish them should their workers express a desire for them.  As for participation selection, this is often decided through an election. The delegates are selected by mass assemblies who nominate and vote on them. An important and quite consistent aspect of this selection of delegates involves the understanding that they are temporary, revocable and ultimately answerable to the assembly who chose them.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The deliberative and decision-making aspects of a workers’ council appear in three parts:  First, there is the selection of the delegates to represent the workers. There is no particular or uniform way that this has been conducted. However, as mentioned above, the most common way has been through elections among mass assemblies.  Second, there is the decision-making process where the workers decide on their agenda. Often this is also conducted within a mass assembly. The workers play the role of the ""general public"" and vote on the issues they want to be discussed. Additionally, they vote on what their stances are on those chosen issues. Subsequently, they communicate these with the delegates who are then to relay this information to the management of the company and pursue these decided interests for them.  Lastly, there is the communication and negotiation between the delegates and the top management. In a more complete cycle of decision-making and information-sharing, not only do delegates share the concerns and viewpoints of the workers, those in positions of leadership or management with access to company information are ideally to divulge this information. By doing so, the delegates are expected to share this information with fellow employees to allow for a better informed agenda and decision-making.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  As workers’ councils emerged out of loosely defined ideas that merely intended to shift control of the means of production back to the proletariat, it has taken on different forms in different places throughout history.  The most profound and widespread rise of the use of this method has been in Europe among members of the European Union (EU). With the establishment of the European Works Council, companies with at least 1,000 employees and with at least 150 employees in two different European Union member states are, under a directive, obligated to set up workers' councils to select delegates. These delegates then serve as the representative of the workers at the EU level. Not only are these representatives sent to communicate the demands and desires of the assembly who elected them, the participation of workers is ensured through the ECW's policy of transparency for the companies. This means that companies have an obligation to divulge company information to delegates to be shared with the workers.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Despite the seemingly good efforts of a workers’ council to promote the level of participation of workers in a workplace by bridging communication between them and the top management at a place of employment or enterprise, it has also attracted criticism because of its historical ties to socialism, communism, and Leninism. Instead of being perceived as a democratic means to allow the participatory rule of the workers of themselves, it is seen as something that endangers a capitalistic enterprise. This has impeded its spread in some cultures that do not perceive those associations positively. More specifically, while European countries have been the most receptive to the formation of workers’ councils going so far as to mandate worker representation, the United States extends its having the lowest rates of union representation among developed nations to the relatively low levels of prevalence and knowledge of workers’ councils.  Additionally, even with those not critical of the Marxist, communist or Leninist roots of this method, it still has potential problems tied to the lack of uniformity on what is expected of it. The deliberative and decision-making aspects of it, if not very conscientiously planned, could just be another field through which politicking of dominant and powerful interests within the workplace could be reinforced.  Another problematic aspect is the unrealistic expectation that workers will have the leisure time to participate in mass assemblies. While the benefits of making time for such a gathering would probably outweigh the costs, in the labour industry where profit is important, there is a weak incentive for employers or the management of enterprises to want to encourage such councils.  Lastly, while its implementation in some instances does indeed lead to greater participation and inclusion of the diverse viewpoints of workers, it can also serve to create a mere illusion of that. More specifically, there are instances when the delegates can choose even more selective delegates among themselves. From the large assembly to an increasingly minimized number of delegates selected for easier negotiations, a workers' council could create the illusion of representation without serving as such in actuality.

A typical first-step implementation is a blog competition in a small democracy such as a student union or a municipality. Voters allocate a limited budget of community funds among various competing blogs. This  can be seen as a variant  of  Participatory Budgeting .  The broad purpose is to improve the policies of democracies and corporations, by better connecting elected leaders with voters, improving voter information and making leaders more accountable for serving the voters' interests.  Although the existing voting systems in democracies and corporations are already intended to make leaders accountable for serving the voters' interests, those systems fall far short of their ideal intended performance. The 2008 financial crisis is a recent example. VoterMedia is based on the following diagnosis of the causes of such problems:  The main cause is the voters' free-rider problem. Voting is a collective decision process, and like any collective, it suffers from serious incentive problems. My vote affects everyone else, and everyone else's vote affects me. Voting well requires time, effort, and perhaps money to become well informed. In a typical large voter community, the expected impact of my vote on myself is very small, so I have little incentive to spend time or money to become well informed.  This is an important part of the reason why private sector media do not provide adequate information to support informed voter decisions -- voters lack the incentive to pay for it  individually . However, as a group, voters do have an incentive to pay for information  collectively . VoterMedia enables them to do so in a competitive framework.  Althugh it may seem a circular argument to solve the voter information problem by voting on competing information sources, the reputations of the competing sources help to resolve this circularity. The blogs (or other media) become part of the democratic system of checks and balances.  Origins and Development  Votermedia was originally conceived in 1988 at the University of California, Berkeley, for the purpose of informing and empowering corporate shareowners. Shareowners would vote to allocate a limited budget of corporate funds to competing providers of information about management policies and director election candidates. However, resistance by corporate boards, management and institutional investors has so far prevented any implementation in corporations.  Instead, votermedia has been implemented experimentally at student unions and municipalities in the Vancouver, Canada area since 2007. The longest and most successful votermedia implementation so far is at UBC AMS, the University of British Columbia's student union (Alma Mater Society) -- see the Participedia Case on this (now being written).  Participant Recruitment and Selection1. Selection of a community:  VoterMedia is designed to help a community of voters (e.g. 1,000 or more) that elect leaders to deploy a substantial annual budget (e.g. $250,000 or more). VoterMedia costs a minimum of about $4,000 per year to be effective. (This is a budget for blog awards. VoterMedia.org is probably willing to help administer the contest for free.) It works best with cooperation from the elected leaders, especially since the funding typically comes from the community budget. So far we have had the most success with university student unions, and have started testing the system with municipal governments. It works better in communities with general access to the internet, such as via public libraries.2. Selection of blogs:  On a general principle of freedom of the press, the competition should be as open as reasonably possible. Contest administrators should have little or no discretion to decide if any blogs should not be allowed to enter. In some of our test implementations at UBC, the sponsor decided to limit entry to UBC students, and to require that most of the blog's content be related to UBC.3. Selection of voters:  Ideally, the eligible voters in VoterMedia should be everyone eligible to vote in the community's elections. This can be achieved by having the VoterMedia voting on the same ballot as a community election. However, a continuous online VoterMedia ballot is also helpful, even if the participating voters will not exactly match those who vote in an election.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The voter community can participate in several ways. Anyone (or any group) can start a blog and enter the competition. Voters are encouraged to read the blogs, comment on them, and vote to allocate shares of the funding to the blogs they find worthwhile. Elected leaders often read the blogs and sometimes participate with comments.  The blogs fulfill the function of active news media. They inform the voter community, especially during election campaigns, but also throughout the year.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Here are quotes from our video  How VoterMedia Affects Election Campaigns :  Bijan Ahmadian, AMS President 2010-2011:  ""VoterMedia has definitely made the election process more accessible.  ...voter media really play an important role and have really been, centre of gravity for voters to come together and discuss issues, discuss candidates, discuss their values, and give candidates an opportunity to respond, to engage with the voters. And it just feels more like a democracy, than it used to, I think, from my perspective.""  Alex Lougheed, AMS VP Academic 2008-2009:  ""...it's definitely, definitely improved the quality of candidates that run in the elections. And the reason for that is there's far more scrutiny, and candidates have to work their butt off quite a bit more, in order to just make ends meet. As a candidate, it's really common to get a ton of emails from each of the [voter media], may they have questionnaires, may they want interviews, may they want to do photo shoots, any of those kinds of things. And that's really increased the amount of public scrutiny on those officials. They're now aware, and they have to be more cognizant of the issues that are at hand, and they also have to have ideas, and they have to be able to contribute to that dialog...""  And from our video  VoterMedia at UBC :  Jason Ng, Blogger,  Social Capital :  ""I think one of the challenges that UBC has always been dealing with over the past few years is: You've got a campus of 45,000 students; that's enough for a pretty big town. And everyone has different interests, everyone's from all kinds of places, and it's hard to bring that community together. And voter funded media has helped start that. It's helped bring together students that were not interested, necessarily, in student politics before. And helped them realize that a lot of the issues that affect UBC go beyond students who have a direct interest in politics, and really affect all the students that are part of the community for the years that they're here. And [VoterMedia] has helped start that and helped generate a greater interest. I think we're seeing that reflected through better voter turnout, through better attendance at voter-related events. That hasn't happened before in previous years, partly because of the support that voter funded media has provided.""  Alex Lougheed, AMS VP Academic 2008-2009:  ""... having those eyes going towards a student voice that's well informed, has been instrumental, not only as a tool for student governments to get their message across, but also as a tool for the student body to get their message across to the student governments.""

Scenarios involve narrative descriptions of potential future problems that emphasize relationships between events and decision points[2]. In addition, scenarios direct attention to causes, areas for development and the span of exigencies that may be met in a local community issue [2]. The workshop is the approach aspect of this method in which participants from a local community engage in discussion, produce some sort of action through  deliberative  discussion and act as decision-makers or create a communal plan of action. The goal of a Scenario Workshop is to create a dialogue among policy-makers, experts and ordinary citizens around a local and communal matter such as water resources or transportation [2].The Scenario Workshop is characterized by its ability to create new knowledge surrounding a local, community issue. Additionally, this participatory method is used to gather knowledge about participants’ understandings and visions of a local topic, by looking into their attitudes towards defined scenarios and the basis for those attitudes towards specifically defined scenarios [1]. Scenarios are developed by experts (scientists) and are thoroughly scrutinized by the participants which connects research and social needs [1]. The Scenario Workshop is used so local communities are involved and find solutions to local problems. This method is also utilized by large organizations, such as the United Nations and the  European Union  to address social and environmental concerns [1]. A Scenario Workshop typically has three stages of involvement which includes: the critical phase, the visionary phase and the implementation phase. During the Scenario Workshop, time is allotted for brainstorming, discussion, presentations and voting [1].  The purpose of a Scenario Workshop is to provide for direct participation of four social groups from civil society. Participants are given a direct opportunity to exchange and discuss their points of view and make recommendations regarding a particular local, community issue with experts and decision-makers (politicians). Essentially, a Scenario Workshop is a tool encouraging dialogue among ordinary citizens, policy-makers, and experts. As a result, community involvement is produced by managed and facilitated discussions between a number of groups with a mixed composition of participants from the same living area. Scenario Workshops increase the chance of timely intervention and control of a present or anticipated problem [5].  The aims of a Scenario Workshop include raising awareness of future problems in a community; helping to develop a common definition of a desirable factor; facilitating discussions between different social groups within a society; examining the differences and similarities, as well as problems and solutions as perceived by the four participating role groups; cultivating steps and solutions for foreseen problems; and stimulating teamwork in coming up with a solutions or recommendations with the ideal result being consensus [5].  Scenario Workshops are not suitable for narrow issues. Additionally, when there are not enough participants, Scenario Workshops are not useful, because a productive and successful workshop cannot be accomplished. A weakness of Scenario Workshops is that the cost to run them is typically high. Additionally, organizing participants from across the community can be difficult, because it requires a good amount of planning to ensure diversity of participants and a rewarding workshop session [1].  Origins and Development  The Scenario Workshop derives from the Scandinavian tradition of citizen involvement in which scenarios are developed and presented by experts (scientists) to a group of citizens from a local community in a workshop that lasts two to three days [8]. Since 1993, this participatory method has been used to actively involve and facilitate the process for citizens to develop decisions about technology politics in cities within Denmark [6]. Another objective of the Scenario Workshop was to develop scenarios that relate to sustainable development and urban ecology in the daily life of Danish citizens. Currently, this method is used throughout Europe by large organizations such as the European Union and the United Nations due to its usefulness. A scenario, a derivative of data or models, aids in the input and discussion of local and communal issues.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  The four role groups present within a Scenario Workshop are representatives of the residents (civil society), politicians (decision-makers), representatives of the economy (founders) and experts in the topic at hand [5]. This subdivision is necessary to balance the various interests of the different role groups and to include them on an equal basis. Typically, participants are selected from a group of 25 to 30 local government officials, technical experts, business people and knowledgeable community residents. All participants should have equal footing in and adequate information of the problem in question, as well as the capability of coming up with potential and viable solutions [5]. Members within the scenario team are asked to have open minds and the ability to work within a team atmosphere [2]. Participants are chosen on the basis of their stake in the issue at hand [4]. The number of role groups and participants within a Scenario Workshop varies depending on the severity and size of the issue.  The selection of participants is a major part of a successful Scenario Workshop. Choosing and contacting the participants is very time-consuming. When selecting participants one must consider the regional structure of a society and be knowledgeable about the key players that concern the topic of the workshops. Organization of participants within a workshop could start several months in advance in order to conduct a thorough and successful workshop. Many of the participants, already grouped into the four role groups, are chosen based on the topic of the workshop [7].  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Experts, or facilitators with extensive knowledge on the Workshop topic, present the Scenario Workshop four stories, or visions, to match the participants’ focus with their responsibility. After the Scenario Workshop experts present the four visions to the Workshop as a whole, participants are then divided into four scenario groups each of which analyzes one of the four visions that was presented by the Workshop experts. Each of the four groups elects a representative member within their small group to present the undeveloped vision of their respective group. Within the groups, the Scenario Workshop experts ask all participants to discuss and deliberate on their delegated vision, as well as be critical of all other visions analyzed by the other groups.  The four divided groups work towards developing a precise vision statement that their elected representative member will announce to the Scenario Workshop as a whole when coming back together. After the four small group visions are presented by each groups’ elected representative, a “common vision” is created. The “common vision” serves as the starting point for the generation of ideas. All participants of the Workshop are asked to develop four topics from the “common vision.” Once this is accomplished, participants are then divided into four thematic groups. Each of the four thematic groups discuss one of the four themes that emerged from the “common vision.” Each participant within their thematic group will provide, in one sentence, a brief idea/action on the respective theme they talked about as a group. Participants who gave an idea/action regarding their small group theme are asked to go more in-depth about their response in order to develop their response more concretely. Participants then vote on the three best responses to present to the Workshop as a whole. A number of ideas are produced from all thematic groups.  After the presentation of all thematic groups’ idea/actions, the Scenario Workshop collectively votes once more on the best ideas/actions in order to narrow down the selection even further. Next, a standard Scenario Workshop evaluation questionnaire is given to all Scenario Workshop participants to determine whether they agree or disagree with the vision statements that were made. Additionally, the questionnaire includes open-ended questions for participants to evaluate the quality of the Workshop overall. Participants are provided one hour to evaluate anonymously. Insights will be drawn from the questionnaire responses.  Conclusions and recommendations from the Scenario Workshop are used by politicians for debate, regulation and are accepted as the input or “the voice of the people.” Therefore, the participant selection process of the Scenario Workshop is crucial. The Scenario Workshop topic is communicated as a local issue that cannot be resolved without the participation of local people and the  Workshop  is designed to find solutions to those local problems. The design of scenarios is a crucial challenge in the Scenario Workshops. The results are used to make better and long-term solutions to problems that affect many community actors involved. Workshop discussions remain confidential until experts or facilitators of a Scenario Workshop make them publicly available through various media outlets [9].  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Scenario Workshops initiate citizen dialogue, create improved interaction between the four societal role groups and provide opportunities for citizens’ input on decision-making in the political arena. The results of the Scenario Workshop play an important role in local debate on issues impacting the community. Additionally, successful Scenario Workshops empower citizens to get involved in the early stages of designing a plan or an issue. Evaluation of Scenario Workshop participants following a project demonstrates that it functions as an important learning experience and paves the way from better dialogue at a local level. The results of a Scenario Workshop are mutual collective efforts that contribute to developing realistic strategies for the topic at hand. Scenarios Workshop findings are taken into account by decision-makers when considering potential effects on future scenarios [10]. However, long-term changes in communities have not been checked or evaluated [10].  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Although Scenario Workshops are helpful in integrating citizen-input into local community decision-making, some of the pitfalls or limitations of Scenario Workshops include the ‘Zeitgeist’ problem in which group dynamics can affect the outcome of the deliberative process. For instance, different exercises will have similar results. The ‘opacity of context’ is another issue confronted by scenario workshops when participants become focused on particular aspects of a certain sector, such as technology, but do not fully evaluate the social, economic and political implications of the associated sector changes. The ‘event evaluation’ is another issue faced by this method in which people have the tendency to overestimate the probability of likely events [2].

The Model UN encourages students to act as leaders and ambassadors of a UN member state, gaining knowledge of a current issue set on the UN agenda. The students represent either a nation, or an NGO in a simulated session of a UN committee, such as the Security Council or the General Assembly. The student participants are given the responsibilities of a delegate and diplomats where they are obligated to create speeches, outline paper drafts, debate,  deliberate , consult with one another, and further negotiate with their member states to resolve and develop solutions to the political issues on the agenda.Through the Global Model United Nations conference, students are encouraged to participate from every region of the world, to act as diplomats and participate in simulated sessions of the United Nations General Assembly and other multilateral bodies in the UN system. The GMUN delivers principles embedded within their organization which differ from the Model UN. For example, they offer rules of procedure which provide a closer look at how the United Nations actually functions. It offers unlimited access to UN official and diplomats before and during the conference. It also encourages diversity by giving students from different countries an opportunity to participate in the simulation exercises[5].  The National Model United Nations is a non-profit organization that aims at educating the student public of the United Nations on its international political issues. This organization’s main purpose is to actively engage students and to mold them to be more effective global citizens. They aim to build strong leaders that are able to collaborate and deliberate about contemporary issues that plague the world. They strive to develop “a world comprised of civically engaged people who aim to create peaceful, multi-lateral conflict resolution and equitable, sustainable human development”[6].  The United Nations Association of the United States is also a non-profit organization that aims to promote and encourage the principles set within the United Nations Charter and the work performed within the United Nations among their national civil society[7].  The essential purpose of the Model UN is to provide an interactive educational experience that teaches students essentially about the United Nations. The simulations offer a detailed experience and understanding of how the process of international debate, negotiation, and diplomacy operates. Model UN's simulation of the diplomatic process is relevant in a world that is becoming more interdependent. Therefore, Model UN makes for informed global citizens who not only understand the decisions their nations makes but also how those changes affect politics nationally, regionally, and globally.  The Model UN aims to solve conflicts and issues set originally on the United Nations agenda. The students, or “delegates,"" prepare to draft resolutions, plot strategy, negotiate with supporters and adversaries, and resolve conflicts which affect almost every country in the world, all in the interest of mobilizing international cooperation. Model UN ambassadors learn how the international community acts on its concerns about peace and security, human rights, the environment, food and hunger, economic development, globalization, and other issues that plague societies today.A related method is  We the People .  Origins and Development  In the early 1920’s, students from the United States participated in collegiate simulations of the League of Nations, the predecessor to the United Nations.[2] For example, National Model United Nations and the Harvard Model United Nation started simulations of the League of Nation during the 1920’s.[3] The Model UN began as the Model League of Nations Assembly, in the early 1930’s. In 1945, the League of Nations was dismantled and the United Nations was created. In 1947, the League of Nations and the Model League of Nations Assembly made a decision to combine their efforts to transition to a new organization that would later be named the Model United Nations[4]. The Model UN has traditionally always been a collegiate driven organization, but in 1968, it was expanded for high school students. The high school level of MUN was established to enhance high school students' participation when it comes to negotiation and oratory skills, and to also broaden their understanding and knowledge of the world.  The Model of UN simulation was designed to be the exact same as the United Nations. The simulations are divided among the different organs of the United Nations, such as the General Assembly, which is the main deliberative assembly; the Security Council for deciding the certain resolutions for peace and security; the Economic and Social Council for encouraging and promoting international and social cooperation and advance development; the Secretariat for providing information needed by the UN; and the International Court of Justice, which is the main judicial organ of the United Nations. Through these five bodies, student delegates  hold mock conferences and regular meetings. During the simulation exercises, students are expected to employ a variety of skills, including in oral and written communication, critical thinking, leadership, and teamwork, which they can apply to their future lives.  Recently simulation of other deliberative bodies, such as the Global Model United Nations, National Model United Nations, United Nations Youth Association, and Regional Conference has been added in the Model UN.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  As the program is not owned by a particular organization, students and non-profit organizations drive the organization. Model UN exercises are generally open to all students who show interest in participating. The Model UN is a learning process; it does not require participants to demonstrate extensive experience in international relations prior to the conference. A Model UN simulation can be practiced on various levels: in classrooms, school clubs, state-wide, national and international conferences. [7] The selection process and prerequisites may vary depending on the level, formality, and size of the Model UN exercise. A club simulation of the Model UN may select their participants through recruitment, while a conference initiated by a non-profit organization may select through applications.  There are various roles in a Model UN simulation such as delegates, Secretary-Generals, committee staffs, committee chairs and press corp. [8] Participants can decide what role to take on or may apply to perform specific roles. Prior to the simulation, participants would complete the necessary preparation work for their role and country of representation.  Some high schools and universities offer Model UN as a semester-long course. In these cases, students who wish to participate in the exercise can register and enroll at their home institution. For example, Chapman University in California offers an MUN course that focuses on learning about the United Nations, international diplomacy, and current international issues. [9]In addition, Model UN conferences can incorporate competitions into the simulation exercise, both on the high school and collegiate level. Awards are given for specific aspects of the deliberations, such as “best delegation” and “best large delegation” presented at the Harvard National Model United Nations conference.  [10]  To participate in larger scale conferences and international conferences (e.g. Asia-Pacific Model United Nations Conference), [11] delegation teams from institutions are required to register with the hosting institution or organization.  The UNA-USA is one international Model UN organization; its Global Classroom International Model UN program demonstrates a rigorous participant selection process. [12] It requires applicants to familiarize with the requirement of the position by providing an overview of the qualifications. The application asks for leadership experiences with the Model UN and a list of short answer questions. After applications are received by the organization, students would be scheduled for an interview to determine acceptance.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-MakingDeliberation  in a Model UN simulation takes place in various committees within the organization. The general committees most often include the General Assembly, Economic and Social Council &amp; Regional Bodies, and the Specialized Agencies. The discussion topics for each committee are chosen by the host institution, which generally includes issues that are currently being discussed in the United Nations. [13]  A member state is usually represented by one delegate in each council, though exceptions can be granted by the host. Prior to the simulation, delegates are expected to have conducted thorough research on their respective countries and write a position paper regarding their stance on the topic.  A basic flow of the deliberation process in a Model UN simulation could be:Agenda Setting  Debate &amp; Caucus  Working Papers  Debate &amp; Caucus  Draft Resolutions  Amendments  Vote on Draft  Final Resolutions[14]The Model UN simulation utilizes Rules of Procedure to facilitate and regulate deliberation. It may include general rules such as the usage of official language, authority of each role, and conduct. Rules of Procedure also contain the rules governing debate, including the debate agenda, the caucus, and the appeal proceedings. During the deliberative sessions, committee chairs act as moderators. In some simulations, the chair would prepare a speakers’ list to ensure equal speaking opportunity. In others, delegates would simply raise their placards to acquire a speaking time. However, delegates are almost always responsible to only speak at the chair’s discretion.  Caucusing in the Model UN simulation is conducted both formally and informally. To open a debate, each delegate takes a turn to address their position on the chosen issue. The delegates split into those who support and those who oppose a specific position and are allocated equal speaking time. In between the sessions, informal small group discussion presents an opportunity for delegates to assemble and work out differences and resolutions. [15]Throughout the sessions, delegates keep a working paper that includes proposals regarding the topic at hand. These working papers can be shared between delegates with the Chair’s approval. This process aids the committee in keeping clear records of new ideas and proposals. Proposals eventually accumulate into more concrete statements and are rewritten into comprehensive resolutions. A number of draft resolutions then go through committees for voting. Each member state has one vote, either voting “yes”, “no”, or “abstention”; although in the Security Council, simulating the UN, one “no” from any permanent member would veto the draft resolution. A draft resolution must be passed through majority voting before it becomes the final resolution.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Since Model United Nations is an academic stimulation to educate students, both the outcome and effect focus on the way young people have grown and developed in terms of participation.  Public officials in national and international governments/organizations have called for voices from young people in a  Global Model United Nations  conference. Ban Ki-moon, former Secretary-General of Republic of Korea and Kiyo Akasaka, former United Nations Secretary-General for Communication and Public Information stated they would like to hear young voices in particular [16] because young people are the leaders of the future world. With the encouragement of public figures, more students are urged to participate in Model UN conferences.Through the conferences, students learn to appreciate and respect the views of different countries with diverse cultural backgrounds, have a better understanding of UN structures, and acknowledge the importance of cooperation from every country to deal with global affairs  [17] . Student participants have even attempted to sway decision-making. For example, young participants in Nigeria Model UN  [26]  conferences became young diplomats who attempted to influence the world diplomacy, and they wrote articles, reports, and newsletters aimed at increasing awareness and ensuring their voices are heard through different media outlets globally.  [18]The Model United Nations conferences mainly concentrate on debating international politics and law, which continue to impact delegates’ real lives. Some participants become increasingly interested in law and policies after gaining essential leadership and problem-solving skills during these conferences. The experience inspires students “toward deeper study of international relations and law and preparation for a career that promotes international understanding and common growth"" [19]. Many public figures such as U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, former World Court Justice Stephen M. Schwebel, United Nations Secretary-General, and actor Samuel Jackson are former Model UN participants [20].  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Though the Model United Nations was intended to  educate  students about world affairs and get them engaged in the deliberative process, funding problems, fee abuse, and criticism began to rise. Model UN receives financial support from international and national governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and private organizations; however, they have faced fundraising deficiencies and budget cuts due to the economic downturn in recent years. Some concerns have resulted that financial problems will lead to less deliberation. For example, according to Model UN Headquarter of Cyberschoolbus, every delegate is required to pay a fee ranging from $15 to $165 to participate in Model UN conferences that are held in hotels and colleges; however, the fee does not include rooms, food, and transportation. [20] Many delegates seek funding from school, scholarship, and local organizations; however, these funds are limited, so potential delegates end up excluded from participation. Miami Dade College’s North Campus has participated at the National Model United Nations conferences in New York City since 1992 and there were 24 delegates attending in 2010.[21] Unfortunately, there were only 11 delegates, half of 2010, going to the conference in 2011 because the College Provost cut Model UN funding based on school budget cuts [21]. Those delegates attempted to raise funds by selling pizzas and sent letters to request sponsorship from different companies [21].  Besides encountering funding problems, the Model United Nations faces some criticism. Critics asked whether it was efficient, reasonable, and necessary for student groups to spend so much money on Model UN conferences; however, only one prominent news article reported fee abuse. The Model UN’s student groups at the University of Wisconsin-Madison requested 133 percent more than the Pre-Law Society’s student groups for the same event, and as a result, Model UN received $1000 and Pre-Law Society only got $300.  [22]  It was unreasonable that Model UN got three times more funds than Pre-Law Society while they did not have three times more members than Pre-Law Society. This “special treatment” resulted in that critics suspected the Model UN’s student group at the UW-Madison as a segregated fee abuser.  [22]Other critics mainly focus on how Model United Nations conferences will actually impact the deliberation process in reality after spending a large amount of money. “As none of the delegates truly represent the countries they are fighting for in the Model United Nations conferences, it is always possible to be reasonable, deliberate, and forward-looking."" [23] Hence, it is easier for delegates to come up with better solutions and reach compromise than real political actors in the world. [23] But because Model UN is not 'real,' it is less likely that its decisions will affect the real deliberation process. [23]  While delegates are struggling with fundings, some Model United Nations conferences offer best/outstanding delegate awards in order to encourage more competition and repay students' hard work.  [24]  Nonetheless, participation is more important than competition. Some people worry about that awards will be ""the sole purpose of attending a Model UN conferences"" [25] for students.

538,method,Habitat Conservation Planning in the U.S.,https://participedia.net/method/538,Section 10 of the ESA is a legislative tool which allows public and private entities to undertake a variety of activities such as land development and construction if their Habitat Conservation plan is approved by the US Fish & Wildlife Services and after public comment. ,0,2012-02-29,2021-07-08,1225,asalshah,https://participedia.net/user/1225,417734,"""Jaskiran Gakhal Participedia Team""",https://participedia.net/user/417734,en,0,,involve,open,,moderate,,evaluation, informal,,,,,national,,,formal, express,,,,,,,make,,," Problems and Purpose  Section 10 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows public or private entities to apply for an 'incidental take' permit if their planned activites are likely to threaten or damage endangered species and their habitats. Habitat Conservation Planning must be undertaken by the applying entities to describe the anticipated effects of the proposed activites, how those impacts will be minimized or mitigated, and how they plan to fund their actions. Section 10 allows for the US Fish &amp; Wildlife Agency — and thus the government — to partner with public and private entities to share responsibility for the conservation and recovery of endangered species. It also makes room for public comment on these projects and the accompanying habitat conservation plans before they are approved by the appropriate government agency. Section 10 seeks to balance the needs of an endangered or threatened species with the needs of landowners so that land development may continue in a way that will not harm the species any further.  Origins and Development  The Endangered Species Act was implemented in 1973. This Act regulates the protection of threatened and endangered species along with their habitat on federal and private property by outlawing the “take” of listed species through direct harm to individuals or through habitat destruction. In 1982, Congress amended Section 10 (a)(1)(B) of the ESA in order to allow private landowners to destroy some endangered species habitat through a permitting system, known as HCPs.[1] It arises from both Sections 9 and 10(a) of the ESA. Under Section 9, it states that it is illegal to kill, harm, or harass a listed species. This applies to private and public lands and “has been interpreted broadly to include habitat destruction or modification.""[2] This was a problem for private landowners, whose activities might accidentally harm or kill the listed species on their land, making them subject to criminal and civil penalties.[2] So, under Section 10(a), non-federal landowners who plan activities on their lands that may 'incidentally take' a threatened or endangered species may apply to FWS or NMFS for an incidental take permit that exempts them from this strict Section 9 prohibition against take.  Section 10(a) was initially created by Congress in order to allow exemption by proponents of a conservation plan on San Bruno Mountain, California, made up in the early 80s.[2] Congress stated in a conference report that this plan intended to act “as a model” for future conservation plans under this exemption. This plan was ultimately based on “an independent exhaustive biological study” and “protected at least 875 of the habitat of the listed butterflies and led to the development of enough land to allow for enhancement of the survival of the species” according to Congress (H.R. Rep. No. 835, 97th Cong., 2nd Sess. 32, 1982. p.32).  Conservation acts before HCPs have been attempted. Some examples of important U.S. conservation acts include: the Yellowstone Park Protection Act of 1872, the National Park Organic Act of 1916, and the Migratory Bird Treaty with Canada in 1916 then with Mexico in 1936.[3] However, all of these measures were regulatory and prohibitory and parks like Yellowstone were mostly preserved for their geography rather than their biology.[3]  Participant Recruitment and Selection  In order to be a participant in HCPs and obtain an incidental take permit, the party or organization must follow certain regulations and comply with a Five Points Policy. Once reviewing the plan, it is the FWS regional director who decides whether an incidental take permit will be issued, based on whether the HCP meets the criteria and addresses the aforementioned requirements as well as other applicable laws.[4]  Regulations required in the HCPs are listed in Section 10 of the Act. The permit applicant needs to include an assessment of impacts that are likely to result from the proposed taking of one or more species. Then there needs to be a list of measures that they will take on in order to monitor, minimize and mitigate for the said impacts, and also mention the way that they will fund these measures. They also need to provide the procedures for how to deal with unforeseen circumstances. After, they are required to list some alternative actions they could have taken, then give a reason or reasons as to why they decided not to partake in those alternative actions. Lastly, the applicant must comply with any other additional measures that FWS may require.[4]  The HCPs must also comply with the Five Points Policy.[4] The first of these polices is defining the expected biological outcome for each species covered in their HCP. Second, there needs to be  adaptive management , which entails “methods for addressing uncertainty and also monitoring and feedback to biological goals and objectives.”[4] Third, it is required to monitor for compliance, effectiveness, and effects. Fourth, there is a duration for the permit which will be determined by the time-span of the project and will be provided, as decided by FWS, to give adequate time to achieve biological goals. Lastly, HCPs must comply with public participation according to the National Environmental Policy Act.  For issuance, the FWS must take all of this into account, as well as the size, duration, and species covered in the HCP. The Federal Registerer will announce the issuance of a permit. Then the permittee and anyone else involved will implement the HCP as well as its monitoring and funding components.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Decisions that concern matters of public trust, such as wildlife protection, must allow public involvement.[5] The public often have a bigger interest in the impact of large multi-species plans that could “damage surrounding communities through a loss of species diversity and open space” [5], thus making public oversight of plan development important and critical. It also helps to make sure that conflicts of interest do not result in a “disservice to the public interest in wildlife protection.""[5] This inclusion assures that citizens will be heard on issues that could change the landscape of their communities, especially if public funding is part of the plan. While this is an attempt at  deliberation , the purpose of public outreach is so that the plan will be more likely to go through rather than outvoted against. However, the citizens are allowed to sue the federal government for enforcement of the Act.  Ultimately, little public participation is required, by law, in the development of  HCPs . However, on submission, the FWS or NMFS must post both the project or activity proposal and the accompanying HCP for public comment in the Federal Register. Upon posting, the public is given 30 days to submit comments. The Secretary of either Agency involved in the review cannot issue the permit before public commenting is finished. Whether these comments have any impact on the granting of the permit is questionable since, under Section 10, the Services do not have to respond to them or even consider them in the final making decision.  In addition, when the permit applicant is a public entity, state or local law requires more public access. For example, in California, there is a state law for governmental HCP applicants that requires them to allow public access to all meetings that involves a public decision making body, such as city council.[5]  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Section 10 aims to balance public and private activity and development with nature preservation. These plans have been multiplying over the past 30 years and over 350 HCPs have now been approved, affecting over one hundred threatened or endangered species populations.  The result of HCPs may have many potential benefits in conserving threatened and endangered species. For instance, they can aim their focus on multi-species and habitat managements, rather than single species. It can also help “engage private landowners and local governments in conservation planning, protect unlisted species, and promote long-term conservation of species and habitats through protection and management.”[1]  Some effects have been positive while others have been negative. Some HCPs that have been approved have contributed to loss of habitat which poses huge risks for species survival, according to Defenders of Wildlife.[1] If not adequately assessed, HCPs can further threaten a species rather than protect them.  Some HCPs have been successful in their aims of conservation, however. An example of one is the Coachella Valley HCP near Palm Springs, California, implemented in 1986. After a rise of rapid housing development on private land in the California desert, the habitat of the Coachella Valley fringe toed lizard was increasingly threatened.[2] This HCP was designed to allow the housing development to continue all while key portions of the lizard's habitat was still protected. They were able to establish three reserves, resulting in 17,000 acres, 8,000 acres of which is occupiable lizard habitat.[2] They were able to get funds for this from The Nature Conservancy, the Federal Land and Water Conservation Fund, and other sources.  Another example of an HCP outcome was in 2006 when Benton County, Oregon, received a grant from FWS to develop an HCP in order to expand upon current conservation efforts by increasing restoration opportunities, providing long-term protection of sensitive species and habitats, and developing a more economical and ecological approach to species conservation and mitigation, according to the Benton County Natural Areas and Parks Department.  In the 1990s, the Clinton Administration made changes in its ESA policies that has increased the “incentive for landowners to engage in the HCP planning process.”[2] Since then, increased numbers in the amount of HCPs have been proposed and approved.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  HCPs on paper can potentially do a lot to help preserve habitats that threatened and endangered species require in order to survive and to thrive. However, there are holes in the way in which the FWS goes about addressing unforeseen circumstances once an HCP is implemented. In Section 10, it simply states that regulations require that all HCPs detail the “procedures to be used to deal with Unforeseen Circumstances.” However, under IA, it prohibits the Services from requiring adjustments in the amount of habitat protected under the HCP. The so-called ""No Surprises"" policy makes it so that landowners will not be able to accept new land-use restrictions or financial commitments beyond those agreed to in the HCP. This means that if the species does not survive over the term of the permit covered by the HCP, then the agencies have to agree to take full responsibility, including both financial and logistical, for the efforts above that are required by the HCP.[2]  This policy especially made environmental groups unhappy. For instance, according to the group, Defenders of Wildlife, this rule prevents HCPs from improving and avoiding species declines. Other problems are that they are not consistent with species recovery, their scientific assessment of the situation is often inadequate, and the public minimally gets the opportunity to provide input for HCPs.[1] This is a problem because with many habitats and species, many unforeseeable changes may come about in the future. Something that the Services can do, as suggested by A Citizen's Guide to Habitat Conservation Plans, is ensure that the proposed strategy be rigorously evaluated, and for the HCP to include provisions to monitor its success and adjust it if necessary.[5]  In addition, the creation of HCPs should encourage more public participation than it currently does. Currently, it is not even technically enforced for a permittee to get citizens involved in their HCP. To make it a more deliberative and democratic process, it is important to highly advertise an open forum whenever an HCP is proposed where citizens, landowners, scientists, biologists, and other experts can attend, much like it is done in California. By making the HCP more deliberative, perhaps it can contribute to the evaluating process and ensure that the FWS makes a wise decision for which HCP they decide to issue. This can both help with an increase in assuring the conservation of a threatened and endangered species and its habitat, as well as rejecting those that just will end up harming them more so than before.

Definitions of deliberation vary greatly from very open conceptions that basically include any kind of talk to conceptions that focus on a rational discourse and specific ways of expression. These different notions of deliberation share the idea of the search of the solutions to a given problem. Thus deliberation is always a productive and creative process.  Some projects currently try to put the principles of deliberation into practice like James Fishkin's  Deliberation Day  using  Deliberative Polling  .  Origins and Development  One cannot track with specificity when deliberation as a political practice started. On the search for the roots of the practice of deliberation one might start with the ancient Greek polis around 500 B.C. on which all those with citizenship (free men) had the right to gather and deliberate about public matters. This kind of deliberation is later reflected in the deliberative procedures in European and North American parliaments starting around 1000. And one should not overlook the role of social movements in developing deliberative practices. Many features of deliberation, like the notion of freedom from domination and decision making among equals, were key elements of anarchist movements.  In contrast to these practical experiences of deliberation, the history of ideas of deliberation can be traced with more precision. Some principles of deliberation can be traced back in democratic theory to works as early as Jean-Jaques Rousseau's (1712-1778). His idea of a  social contract  consisted of people of a polity coming togehter (micro deliberation) and discussing public matters in accordance with the common good. Rousseau's decision making process ended with voting, not with consensus. Nevertheless, most features of deliberation are apparent: unmediated communication in small, decentral units, a relatively equal distribution of wealth, and an orientation towards the common good and thus aiming at consensus.  The two founding fathers of deliberative democracy, however, are said to be John Rawls and Jürgen Habermas. While Rawls and Habermas did not speak of deliberative democracy (at first) their conceptions of justice, an overarching consensus (Rawls) and a public sphere free from domination (Habermas) inspired the academic discourse that was to follow. This discourse actually started with Joseph M. Bessette coining the term ""deliberative democracy"" in the essay with the same title as early as 1980. Only after the translation of Habermas' The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere (1962) in 1989 did the academic discourse on deliberative democracy pick up speed. Major publication by scholars like John Dryzek, Jon Elster, Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson, Joshua Cohen, James Fishkin, James Bohmann, Jane Mansbridge, Iris Marion Young and many others followed.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Deliberation refers to a form of dialogue which can be used in a variety of participatory democratic innovations. The selection of participants thus depends on the intent of the deliberative event's organisers. It is common for organisers to break large groups into small discussion tables to encourage participation and facilitate inclusive deliberative dialogue.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  An important feature all definitions of deliberation share is the notion of publicity. The idea of deliberation is linked to conceptions of the public sphere as opposed to private talk. This link also explains why deliberation is a concept mostly discussed in political theory. Here deliberation is linked to the concept of democracy. Deliberative democracy is described as a process of those affected by a decision coming together to discuss the respective matter under conditions of fairness, freedom from domination, equality and reciprocity. However diverse the interests and identities of deliberators might be, they should keep an open mind and be open to opinion change as they perceive the arguments of others.  Deliberative democracy is best understood in comparison to common conceptions of democracy. The central mechanism of common conceptions of democracy consists of voting. The basic idea is that the will of individuals is expressed quantitatively. The rule of ""one person one vote"" ensures equality, while each can decide selfishly in accordance with his or her own interests. In this cumulative process the majority is decisive: 50 per cent plus one vote wins. In deliberative democracy, in comparison, deliberators ideally talk as long as it takes to reach a consensus. They are oriented towards the common good and thus seek to include the interests of others in their personal decisions. The openness to learning and opinion change enables the deliberators to grow together and overcome differences in opinion and fundamental objections. In the end of this process there are no clear winners and losers but rather everyone wins and loses a little. Ideally everyone wins as not a compromise but a true consensus emerges.  Deliberation can take place at a micro and macro scale. Micro deliberation involves the unmediated conversation between those people affected by a decision. Micro deliberation is thus related to both participatory and direct democracy. Macro deliberation on the other hand describes a large scale communicative process characterized by mediation. Jane Mansbridge terms this the deliberative system : Citizens, activists, journalists and politicians talk to each other. Not all at the same time, but one to the other. They perceive different opinions through newspapers, television and the internet. The political decisions made in the end by office holders are a result of macro deliberation.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Deliberative dialogue produces no clear 'winners' and 'losers'; rather, everyone 'wins' and 'loses' a little. Ideally everyone 'wins' as not a compromise but a true consensus emerges. ""Deliberation is actually an imaginative rehearsal of various courses of conduct. We give way, in our mind, to some impulse; we try, in our mind, some plan. Following its career through various steps, we find ourselves in imagination in the presence of the consequences that would follow: and we then like and approve, or dislike and disapprove, these consequences, we find the original impulse or plan good or bad."" (Dewey 1960: 135)  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The ideal of deliberation has been faced with different kinds of criticism. Realist democratic theorist argue thata deliberative democracy can never be realized because modern capitalist societies are based on inequality. Deliberation is thus always governed by hierarchies which contradicts the ideal of freedom from domination. In this view a division of labour between leaders and followers is necessary. For the reason of scarce resources democracy can only take the form or representation.  Difference democrats argue that the ideal of consensus decision making and the orientation towards the common goods carries repressive features. If everyone is supposed to agree on one outcome those with fewer resources in a deliberative setting will feel greater pressure to conform. This inequality in deliberative setting mirrors inequalities and hierarchies in society. Thus marginalized groups like women, ethnic and sexual minorities, older, handicapped and poor people will be disadvantaged by deliberation. While voting secures the same influence by everyone, deliberation gives weight to the strongest arguments. The arguments that are perceived as the strongest will most likely be uttered by those with greater educational resources and rhetorical skills.  Another criticism uttered towards macro deliberation is that it might maintain the current status quo of inequality. If we perceive the current democratic system as deliberative, than it might be deduced that equality has also been achieved, since deliberative democracy requires equality. Radical democrats call for contestation, public demonstration and social movements activity to challenge the ruling order. Deliberation, in this view, appears reformist at best.

Surveys can be deployed by decision-makers to get a general idea about views on a proposed policy or issue. They are most often used in a consultative manner [2] in order to inform decision-makers of a population’s views [3].  Surveys can be used as a standalone method, but may also form one component of a broader deliberative or participatory process. For example,  Deliberative Polling  includes a survey before and after  deliberation  to gauge preference change. Similarly, the  Scarborough Beach Deliberative Survey  in Western Australia utilised surveys before and after a deliberative forum where participants discussed a local development issue. The  Fremantle Community Engagement Process  also used an initial community survey prior to face-to-face deliberation which gave an overview of policy options that were discussed later in the process, as well as pre and post deliberation surveys.  A survey is generally used to ask a specific population general questions, whilst a poll asks a general population specific questions [2]. More specifically, a survey can be used to ask a range of questions, in different forms, thus generating a wider depth and range of data. By contrast, a poll may ask just one question, with multiple choice options [4]. This can enable a snapshot of public opinion on one specific topic. In practice, the terms survey and poll are sometimes used interchangeably, which can cause confusion [2].  There are two general instances in which a survey may be of use: when there is need to determine broad, general information on a large number of people or when one is interested in answers to more specific, issue-based questions among a smaller, targeted group of individuals.  Depending on the format and design, a survey can collate quantitative and/or qualitative data. This is determined by the type of question selected and the chosen answer options: closed answer (e.g. multiple choice, preference ranking) or open (e.g. dialogue box for respondents to write in their answer) [1].  Surveys are also commonly used in academic research for both qualitative and quantitative research.  Origins and Development  Surveys were not a development of the deliberative turn in democratic politics but are well established for use by governments, business organizations and individuals. In the field of democratic innovation, perhaps the most well-known use of surveys is that of James Fishkin's  Deliberative Polling  technique which uses opinion surveys to gauge the level of attitudinal change among participants before and after  deliberation. Variations of this approach have been used in the  Scarborough Beach Deliberative Survey  and the  Fremantle Bridge Community Engagement Process .  Surveys have been used in different and creative ways as part of participatory processes. In Melbourne,  a digital survey about the future of the city  was included as part of an art installation in a gallery. In Nepal,  surveys were used to gauge views on local radio.  Surveys could be completed using mobile devices and were followed up with face-to-face interviews to provide more in-depth information. The survey findings were then used to inform stakeholders in the media and were disseminated to the public through  social media  in order to encourage greater participation in local radio.  How it Works  The selection of survey participants depends on the intentions of the survey organizers, and on how they want to use the results. For example, if results are to be generalised to a wider population, then a representative sample of that population is needed. If the views of a particular group are sought, sampling can be more purposive, reaching out to that particular group.  Achieving a random, representative sample for any process can be time consuming and costly [1]. Usually, this will require the services of a market research company or consultancy specialised in this area [3]. A random, representative sample is needed if the organizers wish to claim any kind of generalisability about their results. It is possible to conduct a survey through more opportunistic sampling methods but this can bias the sample and thus, the results. For example, putting a survey out on Facebook may elicit a relatively large number of responses, but obviously excludes those who are not Facebook users, and will have implications about the demographics of respondents. Opportunistic sampling may be more appropriate if a generalisable sample is not needed, and a specific group of respondents is sought.  It is also important to consider not only the initial sample that will receive the survey, but the response rate for the survey. With sufficient resources, it is possible to engage a very large demographic. Census surveys are used to collect demographic information from a population. The Canadian 2016 census survey - which was mailed to citizens but also allowed for electronic reporting - had a response rate of over 98% [5]. However, Canadians are legally required to complete the census [6]. For the most part, survey completion is not mandatory, and response rates are usually considerably lower than this [7].  The response rate will also affect the survey outcomes, as different groups may be more likely to respond, creating the potential to skew responses [2]. In the  Fremantle Bridge Community Engagement Process , participants who responded to the initial community survey were generally older than other participants in the deliberative forum. This effect was compounded by the information included in the community survey, which had a framing impact on deliberations.  Surveys can be administered online, face-to-face, over the telephone or through the mail. It may be desirable to use all these methods if a very large, representative is needed. It is also worth considering that the collection methods may affect response rate and participation, so additional methods could be needed to reach certain groups.  The main point of interaction between participants and initiative organizers are the survey questions themselves - whether administered in-person or on paper. It is therefore of utmost importance that questions be expertly formulated so as not to produce biased or skewed responses, as ‘poorly constructed surveys produce poor results’ [1].  Respondents complete surveys as individuals and there is no interaction between respondents. Results are usually collated or aggregated in some way so that organizers can make general statements about the viewpoints expressed. Survey results might be published by the organizers, which is generally considered good practice, especially for public consultations [3].  Closed response questions such as tick boxes/multiple choice, yes/no options are the easiest and fastest type of survey to conduct [1]. They will also provide easily quantifiable data. On the downside, they will also generate limited information and importantly, are less likely to be able to provide information on the reasons and values underlying people’s opinions. Rowe and Frewer (2005) consider a survey that asks respondents only to choose a yes/no response to a question: interpretation of the results will be difficult because there is no indication of the reasons why people responded with yes or no. It is impossible to tell whether everyone who chose ‘yes’ did so for the same reasons, or to evaluate the relative merit of the reasoning behind the options [2]. Furthermore, restricting respondents’ ability to fully express their viewpoint can result in attrition, or in respondents filling out the survey without much thought or consideration [2].  Open response questions can allow respondents to more fully express their viewpoint and yield more qualitative data, although they may result in generating additional irrelevant information [2] and will be more labour-intensive to prepare. Overly long surveys and questions are also more of a burden to respondents and may limit responses [3].  The exact design and question choice will depend on the needs of the organizer, but all good survey questions should be clear and neutrally worded, to avoid leading questions [3]. Surveys should also be piloted beforehand to check questions are suitable and most importantly, elicit the kind of information required [1].  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The outcome of a survey is basically the responses or collated answers given to the questionnaire. This will be entirely dependent on the question design, the sampling and the response rate. Abel et al (2001) note that as questions need to be relatively straightforward and clear, this can result in responses being somewhat superficial [8]. The outcomes of a survey are usually an aggregation of individual responses. As survey respondents complete a survey as individuals, the aggregated response may not reflect the same outcome that would have occurred in a group setting. However, Rowe and Frewer (2005) note that the reverse can also occur - a group response may not reflect the true values and view of the individuals in the group due to the effect of group dynamics [2]. Whatever the outcome, it is usually published publicly if the survey is part of a public consultation or engagement [3].  The influence and effect a survey has will depend ultimately on the purpose of the survey in the first place, and on how those organizing the survey choose to use it. Survey results may be integrated into a broader community engagement process and influence it in a variety of ways. In California, surveys were used to gauge the opinions of people not participating in  deliberative forums on community budgeting , and the results were integrated and presented to the local council. Used in this way, surveys can complement a deliberative process where participant numbers tend to be limited, by gathering opinions from a larger proportion of the population. In  Western Australia , a survey helped shaped the agenda for a community forum, by identifying key issues for discussion prior to deliberations.  It is also worth considering another kind of effect, namely the effect that questions, sampling, and other design choices can have on the outcomes of a survey. In the  Fremantle Bridge case , participants for a deliberative forum were recruited partly through a community survey. This resulted in participants at the forum falling into two groups: an older group recruited through the survey and younger participants recruited through other methods. The result was a potential effect of age on deliberation. This effect was compounded by the information provided in the community survey, which focused considerably on safety as an issue. This further biased the survey respondents, although this effect was partly mitigated by deliberation.The Queensland Plan  was a state-wide consultation on a 30 year strategic plan to develop goals for a range of key policy issues. A community survey was used to gather feedback from across the state, but the majority of responses came from South-East Queensland, the most densely populated area. The effect of this was that many areas of the state were underrepresented in the responses. The survey questions were also criticised as being unclear, and after the survey was deployed, prompts had to be added to the survey to assist people in filling it out. This could have affected the responses given, and could have created a divide between the responses given prior to and after the prompts were inserted, although no evaluation was conducted to assess this possibility.  Another aspect affecting survey responses is the timing of the survey. For one, carrying out a survey at certain times of year (over vacation periods for example) can affect response rates [3]. Secondly, the salience of the issue under consideration can affect the type of responses. In a consultation on  the control of wild horses (considered a feral species in Australia) in part of New South Wales , two surveys were conducted as part of the engagement process. The first survey did not inform participants that the topic was about wild horses, but about national parks in general. This survey was conducted by a survey organisation using a random sample. By the time a second survey was conducted, the consultation was underway and the topic had generated a significant amount of discussion and controversy. The second survey also relied on self-selection, and the combination of these two aspects meant that respondents were more likely to hold strong views than those in the first survey.  Whilst surveys are sometimes considered an inexpensive method of collecting information or consulting the public [7], a well-designed survey requiring a large, random sample can incur significant costs [1], namely for sampling through a professional survey organisation. This needs to be taken into consideration prior to going ahead.  Relative to other methods of consultation such as  focus groups  or deliberative processes, surveys can be carried out in a short period of time [7], given that they do not require people to attend an event/s in person, or commit a significant portion of their time. However, a survey will still require at least six weeks to conduct [1], taking into account the time allowed for responses.  It is vital that care is taken in the construction and form of survey questions, so that they are clear and unambiguous. However, as discussed earlier, this limits respondents’ ability to fully express their views, and may not provide much useful information about why people hold certain opinions [1]. Even with a well-designed survey, organizers will require that respondents are literate in both the language and terminology used in a written survey [7]. This could be mitigated to some extent by telephone or face-to-face surveys rather than written surveys, which also have higher response rates. However, there is no clear winner here - written surveys allow respondents more time to consider their answers than in person or phone interviews.  It is possible that when carefully integrated into a broader deliberative process, some of the weaknesses of a survey can be mitigated. For example, a survey can offer a snapshot of a large sample of the public that most deliberative forums cannot. At the same time, a deliberative forum offers the opportunity for in-depth discussion that cannot be done through a survey. However, using surveys as part of a broader process does not eliminate all the weaknesses of the approach, as shown by the Queensland Plan and Fremantle Bridge cases. Furthermore, a survey may be poorly integrated into a process or survey results may not align with the outcome of a deliberative process. In  South Australia’s engagement process on Nuclear Fuel Storage , a Citizens’ Jury and Aboriginal consultation process both rejected proposals for a fuel storage facility, but the government instead emphasised the outcomes of a state-wide survey which suggested that the community was open to learning more about the proposal. This served to undermine trust in the deliberative process and the genuineness of the government’s community engagement program.

580,method,Real Time Voting,https://participedia.net/method/580,"Real time voting is a proposed method of direct democracy whereby voters can represent themselves online, thereby increasing accountability.

The most obvious advantage of such a system is increased accountability. In a sense, this is a model of democracy without elections, but in another sense, it is a model where every day is election day. This would bind representatives far more closely to their constituents, and potentially lead them to take more consistent long-term positions, rather than promising one thing before the election and doing another for the duration of their term.  It would also mean an end to package deal politics, where voters are forced to choose betweenplatforms despite the fact that they are unlikely to comprehensively agree with any of them.  At present, if one agrees with one (or five) out of ten of Party (or candidate) X's policies, but none out of ten of Party Y's policies, one has the choice of withdrawing their support for the policy they do endorse, or granting it to the policies they do not. The existence of a Party Z (leaving aside the biases against third parties in our current system) actually does little to moderate this effect, as the chances of them agreeing with their voters about every conceivable issue is no more likely.  This problem is compounded by the fact that in reality, the issues that will come before a voting body are not known in advance, and that politicians can simply abandon or change sections of their platforms once the votes are cast – meaning one's vote can be used to advance the nine policies they disagreed with (and three new ones), and not at all for the issues which motivated them to cast it. Under real time democracy, the voter would be able to pick and choose what issues their voting power was used for, and in which direction it was cast.  Another advantage of this system is an end to rewarding representatives for obedience to (and ability to fundraise for) the party machine. These people are essentially granted leadership roles because of their ability to follow.In this system, only a candidate who had fresh ideas and a direct appeal to voters would be of any use to political parties. It is likely in such a system that any parties that did exist would only field one or a few candidates, of exceptional merit, in any particular assembly. The purpose of the parties would be to push for co-ordinated approaches in various bodies (i.e. local, state and federal governments).  Origins and DevelopmentKnow how this tool or technique was developed? Help uscomplete this section! How it Works  The system is most easily conceived as an  online voting  system in which each voter would have a personal homepage. The most important feature on this page would be the voters' “pot”. Upon the first log in, this pot would contain their entire vote. They would then be able to break this vote into portions of whatever size they liked, called tokens, and proceed to distribute them to representatives.A voter could, for example, give a third of their vote to a candidate who shared their economic views, another third to one with their preferred position on the environment, a sixth to a candidate advocating for a persecuted minority, and the final sixth to a candidate advocating for their local community.  This last option is significant, as while such a system would be, by its nature, inimical to district based voting, it would allow for local representation where it was desired – something very difficult in current models of proportional representation where people have one vote, once every four years, which they can dedicate to local or national issues, but not both. Indeed one can imagine a community that felt it had been abandoned by the broader political class quickly pooling a substantial chunk of its votes behind a candidate standing for the sole purpose of advocating on its behalf.  The representatives’ voting power would increase and decrease in proportion with their share of active vote tokens. A representative with a total of 10% of active vote tokens would cast a vote that counts for twice that of her colleague with 5% of active tokens, and half of that of a representative with 20%. Percentages of active tokens would also be important in allocating speaking time, and the number of opportunities a representative would have to introduce a motion.  Importantly, representatives would be required to announce their position on upcoming motions in advance, giving the voter a chance to withdraw their token before it is used against their wishes.  There would be strong arguments for a maximum for the amount of voting power a single representative could wield (somewhere around 40 percent, for example). Also, while it seems necessary that any voter would be able to stand as a representative instantly and at will, it may be decided that a minimum threshold for support must be reached before voting or speaking rights are granted (and certainly before a salary is paid to allow the representative to dedicate themselves to politics full time). Alternatively the system could allow for micro-representatives, people charged with care of the votes of their friends and neighbors, or of fellow followers of a niche political position. Voters who had the time and inclination could also decide to keep all their tokens and vote directly. Alternatively (or as well) this body could not be paired, in a bicameral system with a direct popular  referendum  on each motion passed, thereby allowing for a body of professionals who could dedicate themselves to detailed public debate of issues, without handing over power to them completely.  Also, for simplicity's sake, rather than being infinitely flexible, the vote could be permanently broken into a set number of tokens (e.g. ten, a hundred, etc.), which the voter would allocate in the same manner.Such details however, are probably best worked out through practice.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  One of the main objections raised to this model is that it expects too much of ordinary people, who are thought of as either too lazy or unintelligent to be involved in an ongoing way in politics. To the argument that they are too lazy, one may answer that the current level of participation, both in street and online politics—despite the fact that neither of these realms is invested with any formal power—tells a different story. People get engaged when they see that issues affect their lives. To those who fear that people are not intelligent enough to be engaged at this level, it is could be considered a critique of, and disbelief in, democracy itself.  Furthermore, this system could improve the level of public debate. Currently, many ordinary people consider a detailed discussion of politics to be a waste of their time. Under the current arrangement, short of serious political activism, which most people have neither the time nor inclination to engage in except in exceptional circumstances, their political power is limited to a four-yearly choice from a very limited selection of platforms, over which they have no detailed say—a problem which is even more serious for marginalized groups. Indeed, considering the fundamental flaws of the current system (not to mention corruption by powerful special interests), what is remarkable is not that many people do not bother to participate, but that so many still do. This is a sign of people’s deep and inherent urge to have a say in the collective decisions that face society.

In a CIR, organizers select a panel, made up of a random sample of 18-24 citizens, who are demographically representative of the population. The panelists meet for five days to learn and deliberate about a ballot initiative—a proposed law or constitutional amendment that is drafted by, and can be enacted by a direct vote of, citizens—that will be voted on in an upcoming election. It is comparable to the  European Citizens' Initiative .  During the CIR, the panelists hear arguments from advocates and stakeholders supporting and opposing the initiative, as well as neutral background witnesses’ presentations about issues related to the initiative. Panelists have opportunities to question the advocates, stakeholders, and background witnesses. Then the panelists deliberate to identify important facts about the initiative, to decide whether to support or oppose the initiative, and to identify reasons to justify their support or opposition. The panelists’ deliberations are structured and led by a moderator, who ensures that each panelist’s voice and opinion are heard and considered.  At the end of the CIR, the panelists write a Citizens’ Statement that sets out the facts about the initiative that they agree on, the number of panelists supporting and opposing the initiative, and the panelists’ reasons for supporting and opposing the initiative. The Citizens’ Statement is then made available to the public and the media. In some jurisdictions, such as the U.S. state of Oregon, the Citizens’ Statement is included in the official voters’ guide, a booklet, published by the government, that gives citizens information about candidates and ballot measures to be voted on in an election. A CIR thus lets voters hear from well-informed citizens who help voters make the best choice regarding an initiative.  The key problem the CIR seeks to address is that voters often receive inadequate information about ballot initiatives. Surveys show that many voters are unaware of ballot initiatives before election day. In addition, surveys show that many voters have inaccurate knowledge of ballot initiatives and few voters can express reasons to support or oppose particular ballot initiatives. Further, long-term public policy problems arising from ballot initiatives and the high rate at which ballot initiatives are struck down by courts indicate that many voters lack sufficient information about the policy consequences and the legality of ballot initiatives. The purpose of the CIR is to remedy these problems by improving the quality of information voters receive about ballot initiatives.  Origins and Development  In 1999 in the U.S. state of Washington Michael Lowry, former governor of the state, proposed applying the Citizens’ Jury process to Washington State ballot initiatives; this new process was called Citizens’ Initiative Review.  From 1999-2007, Ned Crosby, founder of  the Jefferson Center  , which developed the Citizens’ Jury, and his wife Patricia Benn developed and promoted the CIR process in Washington State, but the CIR was not incorporated into Washington State’s official initiative process.  In 2000, John Gastil, in his book  By Popular Demand: Revitalizing Representative Democracy Through Deliberative Elections , recommended that the Citizens’ Jury be applied to initiatives and  referenda .[1]  As early as 2002 a Website for the Washington Citizens' Initiative Review was established at the URL: cirwa.org. (For archived versions of that Website,  click here ).  In 2003 Gastil and Crosby wrote an op-ed article reporting survey results showing that Washington State citizens had little knowledge of the initiatives on the 2003 Washington State ballot, and citing these results as evidence of the need for a CIR.[2]  According to Tyrone Reitman, Crosby and Benn also advocated for the CIR in the U.S. state of Oregon in 2003.  In 2005 Crosby and others founded a nonprofit organization called Promoting Healthy Democracy (PHD), which began supporting CIR projects in 2009.  In 2006, Tyrone Reitman and Elliot Shuford organized a project to introduce the CIR in the U.S. state of Oregon. Crosby and Benn agreed to fund the project. In early 2007 Reitman and Shuford founded  Healthy Democracy Oregon  (HDO), an organization that would carry out the project, which was called the Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review (Oregon CIR). After a successful trial in 2008 the Oregon Legislature authorized the Oregon CIR for the 2010 election. In 2010 two Oregon CIRs were held and produced two Citizens’ Statements, which were included in the official 2010 Oregon voters’ guide. In 2011 the Oregon Legislature passed a law making Oregon CIR a permanent part of Oregon’s statewide initiative process.  In 2011 HDO created a new, related organization, Healthy Democracy Fund (HDF). HDF’s activities include raising funds to sustain the Oregon CIR, further developing the CIR process, and applying the CIR method to public policy issues in legislatures in a process called Citizens’ Policy Review.  Participant Recruitment and SelectionKnow how participants are recruited for this method? Help uscomplete this section! How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Once the CIR organizers have chosen the panel, advocates, stakeholders, and background witnesses, the organizers gather the panel and explain the panel’s charge. The panel’s charge is to write a Citizens’ Statement explaining key facts about the initiative that a majority of the panel agrees about, stating how many panelists support or oppose the initiative, and setting out the reasons that the panelists support or oppose the initiative. The charge acts as a guideline for the panel, the advocates, the stakeholders, and the background witnesses.  On the first day of the CIR, the panelists learn about the CIR procedures, practice deliberating according to the CIR procedures while using a hypothetical initiative, receive a brief overview of the actual initiative that will be the subject of their deliberations, and get to know each other. The next three days are dedicated to hearings at which advocates, stakeholders, and background witnesses present arguments and information to the panel. There is time allotted for the panelists to  ask questions  of the advocates, stakeholders, and background witnesses, and also time for the panelists to deliberate. Trained moderators organize the questioning and deliberations to ensure that all advocates, stakeholders, and background witnesses are treated fairly and that all panelists have the opportunity to be heard.  After the hearings have been completed, the panelists engage in final deliberations about the initiative. These  deliberations  are also moderated. During these deliberations, the panelists decide on key facts about the initiative that a majority of panelists agree on, determine whether they support or oppose the initiative, and choose the best arguments supporting or opposing the initiative. Once these decisions have been made the panelists write a Citizens’ Statement that sets out those key facts, the number of panelists supporting or opposing the initiative, and their reasons for supporting or opposing the initiative.  On the final day of the CIR there is a public event at which the panelists present their Citizens’ Statement. In some jurisdictions the Citizens’ Statement is included in the official voters’ guide that explains ballot initiatives to voters.  An important part of the CIR process is the panelists’ evaluation of the CIR process. The panelists are asked to evaluate the process itself and the CIR personnel who moderate and organize the CIR. The panelists use several criteria to evaluate the CIR including the quality of the deliberations and any bias in the process or exhibited by CIR personnel. As part of the evaluation each panelist may write a personal statement in which he or she may express views that were not included in the Citizens’ Statement.  Some time after the CIR has concluded the CIR organizers publish a final report about the CIR. The final report includes the Citizens’ Statement, the panelists’ evaluations of the CIR, and descriptions of the CIR process.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  In 2008 HDO conducted a successful field test using the CIR process. In 2009 the Oregon Legislature approved a trial of the Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review (Oregon CIR) to be held the following year. In 2010 HDO organized two Oregon CIRs, in each of which a randomly selected sample of 24 Oregon citizens learned and deliberated for five days about an initiative that was to appear on the November 2010 Oregon statewide ballot.  The first 2010 Oregon CIR, held August 9-13, 2010, concerned Measure 73, a proposed statute that would impose mandatory minimum criminal sentences for certain repeat offenses concerning driving while intoxicated, and for certain sexual offenses. For details about  Oregon CIR 2010 Measure 73, click here .  The second 2010 Oregon CIR, held August 16-20, 2010, concerned Measure 74, a proposed statute that would have created a regulated distribution system for medical marijuana in Oregon. For details about  Oregon CIR 2010 Measure 74, click here  .  During each Oregon CIR the panelists produced a Citizens’ Statement evaluating the initiative that they had deliberated about. Those Citizens’ Statements were printed in the official 2010 Oregon Voters’ Pamphlet.  John Gastil, Katherine Knobloch, and colleagues conducted a study of the 2010 Oregon CIRs. The key results of the study were:[3]The Oregon CIR panelists had engaged in deliberations of good quality, including consistently ""fair and respectful discussions"";  The Oregon CIR Citizens’ Statements accurately reflected their deliberations, contained no substantial factual or logical errors, and contained new and useful information for voters;  Surveys of Oregon voters showed that (1) most Oregon voters were unaware of the Oregon CIRs; (2) 65% of Oregon voters read the Citizens’ Statement concerning Measure 73 and 57% read the Citizens’ Statement on  Measure 74 ; (3) for those voters who read the Citizens' Statements, reading the Citizens' Statements significantly increased voters' knowledge of and reduced voters' support for Measures 73 and 74; (4) the effect of reading the Citizens' Statements on voters' opposition to the ballot initiatives was too small to have influenced the outcome of the 2010 Oregon statewide election, but was large enough to indicate that in a future close ballot initiative election, a Citizens' Statement could potentially influence the outcome.In 2011 the Oregon Legislature passed a law making the Oregon CIR a permanent part of Oregon’s statewide initiative process.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Gastil and Knobloch's study of the 2010 Oregon CIR concluded that the CIR design used during the 2010 Oregon CIRs had been generally ""appropriate and effective.""[3] In their 2010 report and in subsequent papers they also recommended several modifications to the CIR process:To enhance the stability and the knowledge base of a CIR, a CIR in a particular jurisdiction should be governed by a permanent board, whose members should include CIR organizers and moderators, public officials from the jurisdiction, and former CIR panelists.  If possible, CIR organizers should try to hold CIRs on every ballot initiative to appear on a ballot, and to schedule CIRs well in advance to allow advocates, stakeholders, and expert witnesses ample time to prepare their presentations.  CIR organizers should offer advocates training concerning how to make effective presentations to a CIR panel, because advocates are likely to be unfamiliar with the procedures and time constraints of the CIR.  If fewer than all initiatives to appear on a ballot can be addressed by CIRs, when choosing which ballot initiatives to review, CIR organizers should use particular selection criteria, such as the fiscal or legal impact of the initiative, the complexity of the issue, and the extent of voters’ uncertainty about the issue. Using such selection criteria will ensure that CIRs address ballot initiatives about which voters most need information.  The voting requirement for including a key factual finding in a Citizens’ Statement should be raised from 14 to 18, to ensure that included findings have broad support among panelists.  Citizens’ Statements should address general concerns and include value-based arguments, so as to be more accessible and relevant to voters.  CIR organizers should assure panelists that unanimous support for or opposition to a ballot initiative is an acceptable outcome of the CIR. This assurance should prevent panelists from taking a position that is contrary to their views, merely in order to avoid a unanimous outcome.  CIR organizers should give panelists sufficient time to deliberate about their reasons for approving and opposing the initiative, especially when one side has relatively little support, because such deliberation improves the quality of those reasons.The Social Capital Review published an article, by DeAnna Martin, about the Oregon CIR. The article summarized the Oregon CIR process in a positive light; when comparing the Oregon CIR's participant-selection procedure to the Jury Process, it saw the Oregon CIR as a beneficial addition to Oregon’s democracy.[4]  Some criticisms of the Oregon CIR have been expressed by proponents of Measure 73. These advocates argued that the Oregon CIR process was flawed on the grounds that the Oregon CIR sampling procedure was not stratified on the basis of support for or opposition to the measures; that advocates were not allowed to cross-examine other advocates, stakeholders, or background witnesses; and that advocates, stakeholders, and background witnesses were not required to testify under oath.

The method requires participants to read workbooks containing information about the policy issue, consider several possible policy approaches -- each of which is associated with certain values -- for addressing the issue, consider multiple means of funding those policy approaches, identify policy objectives, and then weigh tradeoffs in making feasible policy and funding choices that will further those objectives. Surveys measure participants' attitudes about the issue at the start and end of the deliberation, comparable to  Deliberative Polling  . Survey results are used by the organization sponsoring the deliberation as evidence of informed public opinion about the issue.  According to Viewpoint Learning , the Choicework Dialogue method is intended to address the problems of volatility and superficiality in public opinion research. Research and theory suggest that most citizens are poorly informed about, and so do not have informed opinions about, most public policy issues. Research also suggests that citizens when considering policy issues in everyday life do not ordinarily consider the tradeoffs in interests or values that are usually necessary to choose a public policy that is both feasible and acceptable to a diverse public. Accordingly, results of most public opinion polls are likely to be volatile and to have low validity, and are unlikely to reflect tradeoffs in values or interests. The Choicework Dialogue method -- by guiding a representative sample of citizens through a structured deliberation that requires participants to learn about a policy issue, to consider multiple policy approaches each of which is associated with values held by large numbers of citizens, and to make tradeoffs in values or interests necessary to creating a policy that is feasible, capable of broad public support, and effective at furthering policy goals -- is designed to produce public opinion survey results that are more stable and valid than are most public opinion polls, and that reflect tradeoffs in interests or values.  Origins and Development  According to Yankelovich (1991), the term ""choicework"" was introduced by David Mathews of the  Kettering Foundation  -- perhaps in the 1980s -- to describe several deliberation methods intended to enable participants to ""work through"" difficult policy problems. Yankelovich subsequently used the term ""Choicework Dialogue"" to describe his particular three-stage dialogue method. Later Yankelovich's organization  Viewpoint Learning  changed the name of this three-stage dialogue method to Choice-Dialogue.  Choicework Dialogue has been used in many public policy deliberations, including:Beyond Wishful Thinking: Californians Deliberate State Budget Reform (2008)  California Citizen Dialogues on K-12 Education Reform (2007)  Citizen Dialogues on Covering the Uninsured (2004)  Citizen Dialogues on Paying for Health Care in Retirement (2008)  Citizen Dialogues on the Coming of Age in Arizona (2003)  Citizens' Dialogue on Canada’s Future (2002)Citizens' Dialogue on the Future of Health Care in Canada  (2002)  Citizens' Dialogue on the Long-term Management of Used Nuclear Fuel in Canada (2004)CommonGround: The First Five Years: A Dialogue on Early Childhood in New Mexico  (2010)  Facing Up to Our Nation's Finances: Changing Expectations: Americans Deliberate our Nation’s Finances and Future (2006-2007)  The Future of Housing in San Mateo: Citizen Dialogues (2003)  The Future of the San Diego Region’s Airport: Choice-Dialogues with County Residents (2004)  Health Coverage for All Arizonans: Citizen Dialogues (2005)  Health Coverage for All Californians: Dialogues with the Public (2005-2006)  Listening to Californians: California Citizens' Dialogues About California's Government (2004)  San Diego Dialogues on Community Water Fluoridation (2005-2007)  Sustainability Research Initiative: Listening to the Public: Understanding and Overcoming Barriers to Sustainability: [Vancouver ChoiceDialogues] (2005)  Voices for Health Care: Engaging the Public to Advance Significant Health Care Reform (2008)Participant Recruitment and SelectionViewpoint Learning  often describes the participant selection process for Choicework Dialogues that address public issues as ""random selection"" such that the participants are ""representative of the broader population."" Each sample consists of approximately 40 participants.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The following description of a Choicework Dialogue about a public policy issue is based on the method used during the  Citizens' Dialogue on the Future of Health Care in Canada  .  The goal of a Choicework Dialogue about a public policy issue is usually to give guidance to government officials or other community leaders respecting informed public opinion about the policy issue.  To prepare for a Choicework Dialogue about a public policy issue, a project team -- often consisting of personnel from the sponsoring organization, the facilitating organization, and one or more local partner organizations -- generally reads relevant scholarly and policy literature and consults with experts on the issue and stakeholders respecting the issue, including government officials.  From those information sources the project team writes a workbook describing a small number of important dimensions or sub-issues of the principal policy issue, the facts related to those sub-issues, up to four ""scenarios,"" and advantages and disadvantages of each ""scenario."" A ""scenario"" is an account combining a description of a broad policy approach -- or set of policy instruments -- that is related to important values believed to be held by a large portion of the relevant community, with descriptions of advantages and disadvantages associated with that approach. A ""scenario"" generally does not describe policy objectives. The workbook also usually describes several options for funding each scenario.  After the project team completes a draft of the workbook experts and stakeholders are invited to comment on the draft workbook. Using those comments the project team makes final revisions to the workbook.  Each Choicework Dialogue consists of one continuous, 8-hour session, and has approximately 40 participants.Viewpoint Learning  calls the first part of a Choicework Dialogue ""Opinion Formation."" At the start of each Choicework Dialogue each participant receives a workbook. Trained facilitators explain ""the purpose of the dialogue,"" how the results of the dialogue will be used, and the procedure and ""ground-rules"" of the dialogue for the session. The facilitators then explain the important sub-issues discussed in the workbook and present facts concerning them. Next, the facilitators explain the scenarios described in the workbook. At this point the participants complete a survey respecting their beliefs about the sub-issues described in the workbook and their attitudes respecting each of the scenarios and funding methods described in the workbook.  After completing the survey the second part of the Choicework Dialogue -- called ""Working Through"" -- begins. During this second part of the dialogue participants engage in discussions in small groups and in plenary sessions to determine desirable and undesirable effects of each scenario and the participants' preferred ""vision of the future"" respecting the policy issue that is the subject of the Choicework Dialogue. The ""vision of the future"" contains policy objectives. Trained facilitators moderate the small-group and plenary discussions to ensure compliance with the ground-rules.  Once the ""vision of the future"" has been agreed the participants break for a meal. After the meal the Choicework Dialogue participants work again in small groups and plenary sessions to discuss the tradeoffs respecting the scenarios and funding methods that would be required to realize their preferred ""vision of the future."" Once again trained facilitators moderate the small-group and plenary discussions to ensure compliance with the ground-rules.  During the third and final part of the Choicework Dialogue, called ""Resolution,"" during their discussions of scenarios, funding methods, and tradeoffs a majority of participants typically reach agreement on one or more scenarios -- or components of scenarios -- and funding methods that make up their preferred policy approaches. At the end of these discussions participants complete another survey respecting their beliefs about the sub-issues described in the workbook and their attitudes respecting each of the scenarios and funding methods described in the workbook.  After the conclusion of the Choicework Dialogue the project team analyzes the survey results. During some Choicework Dialogues the project team interviews some participants and/or records the dialogue, and then conducts qualitative analysis of the interviews and/or the dialogue as reflected in the recording. The project team writes a report describing the qualitative and quantitative results of the dialogue. Finally, the project team shares the report with the sponsoring organization.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  In terms of effects on participants, quantitative results of many Choicework Dialogues show that participants' beliefs or attitudes about information in the workbook undergo substantial change during the dialogues. For example, reported quantitative results of the  Citizens' Dialogue on the Future of Health Care in Canada  showed that participants' attitudes about two (out of four) scenarios underwent substantial change during the dialogue:Respecting Scenario 1 (concerning increasing public funding for the existing Canadian public health care system) the percentage of participants supporting this scenario rose from 48% at the start of the dialogues to 61% at the end of the dialogues.  Respecting Scenario 4 (concerning overhauling the primary care component of the Canadian public health care system) the share of participants supporting this scenario rose from 56% at the start to 79% at the end of the dialogues.Similarly, the reported quantitative results of the Choicework Dialogues held in connection with  CommonGround: The First Five Years: A Dialogue on Early Childhood in New Mexico  showed that participants' beliefs about one sub-issue and participants' attitudes about one funding method had changed notably during the course of the dialogues:The percentage of participants who believed that the period from birth to five years was the most important for a child's future outcomes rose from 66% at the start of the dialogues to 85% at the end of the dialogues.  The percentage of participants who supported increasing public funding for early childhood education and development, even if that meant cutting public spending on health and public safety, dropped from 77% at the start of the dialogues to 56% at the end of the dialogues.In Choicework Dialogues involving multiple dialogue events reported results often show consistency among events respecting ranking of scenarios and funding methods and other quantitative survey results.  In terms of qualitative results reports often describe highly positive responses from participants respecting feelings of community or solidarity or feelings of having been treated with respect during the dialogue. Some reports of qualitative results of Choicework Dialogues describe participants' accounts of feeling ""transformed"" by the dialogue experience.  Several Choicework Dialogues appear to have influenced the policy decisions of the sponsoring or target organizations. For example, less than a year after the conclusion of the Choicework Dialogues held in connection with  CommonGround: The First Five Years: A Dialogue on Early Childhood in New Mexico  , New Mexico enacted a state statute -- entitled the Early Childhood Care and Education Act [SB 120] -- that implemented several policies recommended by participants in the CommonGround dialogues.  In another example, several policy recommendations agreed by participants of the  Citizens' Dialogue on the Future of Health Care in Canada  appear to have been incorporated into the final report of the Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada (known as the Romanow Commission), entitled  Building on Values: The Future of Health Care in Canada .  The Choicework Dialogue method has also influenced other communication methods used for public deliberations. For example, the ""Citizen Dialogue"" method used by the Canadian Policy Research Networks to structure several Canadian public policy deliberations was based on the Choicework Dialogue method. In addition, the Choicework Dialogue method appears to have influenced the ""dialogue process"" used by EKOS Research Associates in certain public deliberations such as the Citizens’ Dialogue on Public Health Goals in Canada.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Several strengths of the Choicework Dialogue method are evident. First, Choicework Dialogues regularly produce substantial changes in participants' attitudes or beliefs respecting the issues being discussed. This indicates that the Choicework Dialogue method fosters genuine deliberation.  Second, the results of Choicework Dialogue often influence policy makers, as in the examples of  CommonGround: The First Five Years: A Dialogue on Early Childhood in New Mexico  and the  Citizens' Dialogue on the Future of Health Care in Canada  discussed above.  Third, the use of random sampling lends credibility to the results of Choicework Dialogues.  Fourth, in some instances where public-opinion polling has been used in connection with Choicework Dialogues, similarities and differences between the dialogue and polling results suggest that (a) as predicted, the dialogue results are representative of the broader population respecting items that were not the subject of the ""working-through"" dialogue stage; and (b) also as predicted, dialogue results differ substantially from polling results on items that participants ""worked through"" during the dialogue. These results support the view of Choicework Dialogue as a means of determining what ""informed"" public opinion on a policy issue would be given deliberation requiring respondents to consider important values and to make difficult tradeoffs.  Fifth, the Choicework Dialogue method can scale. The method has been used in single-dialogue events involving only 40 participants on a single day, as well as in nationwide dialogues consisting of ten or more events involving hundreds of participants who meet over the course of several weeks.  Sixth, Choicework Dialogue has been used successfully at many governmental levels -- including local, regional, and national levels of government -- and in multiple contexts, including citizens' public-policy deliberations and dialogues with employees of individual private businesses about intraorganizational policies.  Seventh, Choicework Dialogue can be used to address issues of great complexity and controversy, such as health care reform, early childhood education and development, land use planning, state budget reform, and nuclear waste management.  Nonetheless some criticisms of Choicework Dialogue have been expressed. Von Lieres and Kahane (2007) have criticized the Choicework Dialogue method on the grounds that political and social elites dominate the process by determining the workbook content -- including the dimensions of the issue and the relevant values to be considered and the policy and funding approaches to be weighed -- and discussion procedures. For von Lieres and Kahane (2007) this arrangement gives ordinary citizens a very small role in the process -- apart from the functions of choosing policy objectives in the ""vision of the future"" and ranking the policy and funding approaches -- and does not allow participants to reflect critically upon the deliberative process. Von Lieres and Kahane (2007) further argue that the Choicework Dialogue method does not adequately address the issues or perspectives of socially marginalized groups -- notwithstanding that those groups are represented among the participant sample in proportion to their numbers in the population -- because the workbook content and the discussion rules reflect the views and customs of the majority and/or elites. For these reasons von Lieres and Kahane (2007) question the extent to which Choicework Dialogue method can be considered ""democratic, or deliberative, or inclusive.""

Generally, organizers assume that social change will necessarily involve some element of conflict and struggle, as opposed to  consensus , in order to generate collective power for the powerless. The process aims to generate durable power for the community organization, such that it can influence key decision-makers on a range of important issues over time. Community organizers work with and develop new local leaders, facilitating coalitions and developing campaigns. [1]  Community organizers typically aim to create democratically-governed groups, which are inclusive and accessible to the members of the community, and focus on specific interest groups rather than the community as a whole. Organizing seeks to broadly empower community members, with the end goal of ""distributing"" power more equally throughout the community. [1]  Community organizing is not to be confused with community development, which focuses more on consensus and is usually directed by educated professionals working in government, non-profit, or business organizations. Community development projects increasingly involve community participation and seek to empower residents in impoverished areas with skills and training, but the process generally assumes that collaboration to solve community challenges can occur between groups and individuals without conflict or power struggles. One popular form is  asset-based community development , which focuses on seeking out existing strengths in the community. Yet, the relationship between community organizing and community development is nuanced, as the literature is similar, and since the 1970s, community development practitioners have been influenced by structural analyses of inequity and power distribution. [1]  Origins and DevelopmentCommunity Organizing in the United StatesRobert Fisher and Peter Romanofsky identify four rough periods for community organizing in the US: [2]1. 1880 to 1900People organized immigrant neighbourhoods in urban centres to meet the pressures of rapid immigration and industrialization. The dominant approach is termed social work by Fisher since the organizers focused on building community through settlement houses and other service mechanisms.2. 1900 to 1940Community organizing methodology was generated in Schools of Social Work during this period, grounded in the philosophy of John Dewey, which focused on experience, education, and other sociological concepts. Anti-capitalist doctrines were relevant during this period and organizations tended to be nationally focused during the depression era since change regarding economic issues seemed more likely at the national rather than neighbourhood level.3. 1940 to 1960Chicago-based Saul Alinksy is credited with originating the term community organizer. Alinksy was the founder of the first national community organizing training network, as well as the first to codify key strategies and aims of community organizing in his books, Reveille for Radicals, published in 1946, and and Rules for Radicals, published in 1971.  The following excerpts from Reveille for Radicals give a good sense of Alinsky's perspective on organizing and of his public style of engagement [3]:A People's Organization is a conflict group, [and] this must be openly and fully recognized. Its sole reason in coming into being is to wage war against all evils which cause suffering and unhappiness. A People's Organization is the banding together of large numbers of men and women to fight for those rights which insure a decent way of life....A People's Organization is dedicated to an eternal war. It is a war against poverty, misery, delinquency, disease, injustice, hopelessness, despair, and unhappiness. They are basically the same issues for which nations have gone to war in almost every generation.... War is not an intellectual debate, and in the war against social evils there are no rules of fair play....A People's Organization lives in a world of hard reality. It lives in the midst of smashing forces, dashing struggles, sweeping cross-currents, ripping passions, conflict, confusion, seeming chaos, the hot and the cold, the squalor and the drama, which people prosaically refer to as life and students describe as ""society.""4. 1960 to presentThe civil rights movement, anti-war movements, Chicano movement, feminist movement, and gay rights movement all influenced and were influenced by ideas of neighbourhood organizing. ""Experience with federal anti-poverty programs and the upheavals in the cities produced a thoughtful response among activists and theorists in the early 1970s that has informed activities, organizations, strategies and movements through the end of the century. Less dramatically, civic associations and neighborhood block clubs were formed all across the country to foster community spirit and civic duty, as well as provide a social outlet."" [1]Loss of urban communitiesDuring these recent decades, the process of white flight where middle-class Americans move out of predominantly Black regions, and the professionalization of community organizations into 501(c)(3) non-profits, contributed to the dissolution of tight ethnic and racial communities. Therefore, community organizers began moving away from efforts to mobilize existing communities and towards creating and fostering relationships between community members. While organizers like Alinksy had long worked with churches, these trends led to increased congregational organizing in the 1980s, as one of few broad-based community institutions remaining. [1]Emergence of national organizing support organizationsTraining and support organizations for national coalitions ""of mostly locally governed and mostly FBCO community organizing groups were founded in the Alinsky tradition. The Industrial Areas Foundation was the first, created by Alinsky himself in 1940. The other key organizations include ACORN, PICO National Network, Direct Action and Research Training Center, and the Gamaliel Foundation."" [1] The organizer's role was ""professionalized"" such that it could be more like a long-term career than a brief, unfunded interlude. Training by these ""umbrella"" organizations enabled a common language around organizing to emerge among local volunteer leaders while expanding their skills. The Midwest Academy, based in Chicago, provides week-long training in organizing nationally to organizers and leaders who are not part of these established national organizations. The Center for Third World Organizing provides training focused on ""change efforts in communities of color."" CTWO advocates a process in which those that are most impacted are leading the fight for social change. CTWO offers multiple trainings that provide the tools needed to become an effective organizer.  The distinction between an ""organizer"" who staffs a community organization and ""leaders"" who make decisions and provide the public face of their groups was increasingly standardized over these years, even in many organizations not linked to ""umbrella"" training groups as the Alinsky tradition became increasingly influential.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Neighbourhood and community organizations are typically open to all and specifically address community members. However, informal hierarchies and exclusionary mechanism might be at work.

 Problems and Purpose 
 Term limits are a defined maximum amount of time that a person can be in any representative office for any reason. The aim of term limits for a President or Prime Minister is to reduce the chances of a single leader remaining in office for an excessive period of time. 
 In the United States, a President can only serve two terms [1]. Some politicians and commentators have argued that members of Congress should also have term limits imposed, an idea which has been contested [2]. There are less likely to be term limits in parliamentary democracies because in practice, a Prime Minister serves as long as they have the confidence of Parliament - this is not necessarily fixed. However, it has also been argued that parliamentary democracies like the UK should introduce term limits [3]. 
 Origins and Development 
 How it Works 
 Term limits are usually determined by a state's constitution or amendments, or through legislative tools.

The Citizen Dialogue method is based on  Viewpoint Learning 's  Choicework Dialogue  method. In Citizen Dialogue, a randomly selected sample of approximately 20 citizens is given a workbook about a policy issue, and then meets for one or two structured and moderated sessions in small groups and plenary sessions to discuss the issue. At the beginning and end of a Citizen Dialogue, each participant completes a  survey  measuring the participant's attitudes about aspects of the policy issue discussed in the workbook.  This participatory method is designed to create a channel between citizens and political decision makers to inform the policies of the latter. The use of the workbook enables citizens to shape their political opinion about new policies. The process thus enables both input of lay opinion into the political process and informing citizens of political possibilities (and impossibilities).  Origins and Development  This participatory method was first developed as the  Citizens’ Dialogue on Public Health Goals in Canada .  During the 1990s and early 2000s, Canadian public health research and government inquiries identified several problematic issues respecting public health in Canada. These problems included unequal health outcomes among Canadian citizens, the future health of Canada's children, Canadian citizens' nutrition and physical fitness, disaster preparedness and response, and environmental protection.  In the early 2000s, much public debate and discussion of Canadian public health policy took place. Some notable examples of these debate and discussion were the  Citizens' Dialogue on the Future of Health Care in Canada , the  report of the Commission on the Future of Health Care  (also known as  The Romanow Report ), and the 2003 Canadian First Ministers' Accord on Health Care Renewal.  In 2004, Canada's First Ministers met to consider the state of Canada's public health policies in light of the debate and discussion of the previous few years. The First Ministers issued the 2004 Canadian First Ministers' Health Accord, which called for the development of a ""pan-Canadian Public Health Strategy."" The 2004 Accord also required ""governments"" to ""set goals and targets for improving the health status of Canadians through a collaborative process with experts.""  To obtain public input on Canadian public health goals the Public Health Agency of Canada commissioned EKOS Research Associates,  Canadian Policy Research Networks (CPRN) , and OneWorld Inc. to hold the  Citizens’ Dialogue on Public Health Goals in Canada  (""Citizens' Dialogue"") in 2005. During the Citizens' Dialogue, which was held in August 2005 in five locations in Canada — in ""Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Quebec City (French) and Halifax"" — a randomly selected and representative sample of a total of 102 participants, with approximately 20 participants meeting in each location, met in-person to discuss ""public health goals for Canada."" The  deliberation  method used during the Citizens’ Dialogue on Public Health Goals in Canada was CPRN's Citizen Dialogue.  After the Citizens' Dialogue had concluded, a Goal Statement Working Group used the results of the Citizens' Dialogue, along with input from other consultations with Canadian citizens and experts, to develop a set of eleven draft public health goals for Canada.  In October 2005, the Goal Statement Working Group held a conference during which these eleven draft Canadian public health goals were discussed. Ten Citizens' Dialogue participants (2 from each location) attended the conference. That same month, the Canadian First Ministers agreed nine Health Goals for Canada.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Typically, a sample of approximately 20 citizens is  randomly selected  in order to ensure representativeness.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  In Citizen Dialogue, approximately 20 citizens are randomly selected to be given a workbook on a particular policy issue prior to meeting. They then participate in one or two structured and moderated sessions consisting of a total of 8 to 12 hours in length, using small group discussion and plenary sessions to deliberate on the policy issue. To both begin and end the Citizen Dialogue, each participant completes a  survey  measuring their attitudes about aspects of the policy issue discussed in the workbook. The final survey also contains items about the quality of the dialogue results.  Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsKnow what outcomes and effects this method typically has?

They are generally convened by the government or a public agency and typically meet several times over a period of weeks or months to learn about, discuss, and reach agreement (or alignment) on a contentious public issue.[1]  Citizens' Reference Panels will have anywhere from 14-54 citizens members, with equal numbers of men and women, while matching the age profile of the region or jurisdiction they represent. Much like a Royal Commission, the recommendations of a Citizens' Reference Panel are non-binding though they do carry moral stature.[1]  Origins and Development  Citizens' Reference Panels developed as an offshoot of the  Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform in British Columbia  in 2004 and in Ontario in 2006. Since then Citizens' Reference Panels have been used primarily for citizens to  deliberate  on healthcare issues in Canada.  Reference Panels are part of a so-called 'deliberative turn' in Canadian healthcare, beginning in 2002 with the Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada which utilised  dialogue  and deliberative techniques to understand citizens' view on transforming the healthcare system in Canada. [2]  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Members of a Citizens' Reference Panel are randomly invited and selected during a  civic lottery  process. They are considered volunteers and with the exception of reimbursements for travel, they receive no financial compensation for their time.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Citizens' Reference Panels appear similar in format to  Citizens' Juries , although they may meet over a longer period of time than a CJ.  One panel on health technologies  met over a period of 18 months for five one-day meetings, whereas Juries usually meet for one or two day periods over a period of a few months.  Prior to meeting, information on the topic is circulated to participants through a workbook. The topic is decided beforehand by whoever is convening the panel and with key stakeholders. Like a Citizens' Jury, participants hear relevant evidence and information from a range of expertise, and take part in structured discussions and small group deliberation.

They are common at the local level such as that in  Amherst, Massachusetts .  Representative Town Meetings share some of the features of  New England Town Meetings  in that they are both open to all residents of voting age. In New England, the meeting model which emerged in the 17th century allowed all citizens to dicuss  and directly vote  on legislation. Today, most meetings in the New Engalnd area only allow citizens to discuss issues with elected council members, but not vote on them. In contrast, in Representative Town Meetings, citizens elect members to participate and directly vote on legislation. Thus, while New England Town Meetings are a form of consultation like  Public Hearings,  Representative Town Meetings are more analagous to local parliaments or councils with elected representatives given legislative power.  Representative Town Meetings aim at making local politics more direct and at including regular citizens, who do not represent a political party, into legislative processes. In contrast with normal open Town Meetings, they strive to be more representative of the local population by electing members from all precincts. They include members of the society, who do not just wish to speak or vote on one specific subject that directly affects their interests like in open Town Meetings, but people who commit to this legislative work for a longer period.  Origins and Development  Representative town meetings are common in New England in the United States, and its origins are in congregational self-government exercised within the English Independent or Congregationalist churches.Participant Recruitment and Selection  Citizens who wish to be elected as member of a Representative Town Meeting usually face very low barriers to running for election. Sometimes they have to collect signatures from a low amount of other citizens in support of their candidacy. In other cases they just have to declare their willingness to run. This is followed by an election by all eligible citizens.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Representative Town Meetings are usually moderated discussions with certain procedures and rules, like restricted speaking time, a restrictions of how many contributions each member can make on a certain topic, and an order of contributions. The agenda of meetings are set by a specific group of members forming a board with certain authorities.  Unlike the New England Town Meeting model, Representative Town Meetings are similar to local parliamentary bodies or councils in their legislative functions. However, the Representative Town Meeting model differs from these other participatory institutions in the following ways:Elected members should not come from political parties and if they do this fact is not advertised. This strengthens the grass-root character of this institution as members are not professional politicians.  Members of Representative Town Meetings usually do not get a salary or financial compensation for their participation, which also works against forming a political elite and ensures that citizens bring various expertise from their different professions.  Representative Town Meetings are more responsive to the population than regular local parliaments. They are publicly announced and mostly open to all citizens to take part in the discussion, but not vote. Moreover, citizens often have the right to  petition  if they would like to put a certain subject on the agenda of the meeting, and they can petition against decisions made by the Representative Town Meeting.  Terms of Representative Town Meeting members are shorter, between one and three years, compared to the four or five year terms of members of local parliament. This rotation principle has the goal of a higher fluctuation and thus greater inclusiveness of legislative bodies.  Usually there are more members in Representative Town Meetings compared with common local legislative bodies, which makes them more inclusive.  Town Meetings convene less often than regular local legislative bodies. Normally, there are a couple of meetings around the same time once per year.Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsKnow what outcomes and effects this method typically has? Help uscomplete this section!Analysis and Lessons Learned  Representative Town Meetings are an interesting mixture of representative and participatory democratic elements. In a way, they are close to the original idea of parliament without factions and parties.  However, they have some disadvantages. They are to a certain degree exclusive, as elected members tend to be more interested in politics, more educated, and more vocal than other citizens. Thus those with fewer educational resources and those who tend to be shy and less outspoken tend to be at a disadvantage. Jane Mansbridge (1983) showed in her study of a open Town Meeting that the tone in these meetings tended to be harsh at times and that many feared participation as they were scared to be laughed at or mocked. [1] This held especially true for women. One might speculate that in Representative Town Meetings the tone might be more polite or civil as a certain honor comes with the election as member of this body. Nevertheless, exclusive tendencies persist.  See AlsoRepresentative Town Meeting (Amherst, Massachusetts, USA) New England Town Meetings   References  [1] Mansbridge, J. (1983).

 The system is useful for constituted groups only, which follow a certain aim, such as clubs or political parties. 
 The system builds up a full market system as is generally a stack of a many B2B markets above a primary B2C market. Proposals are not voted upon any more, but are offers for representation and are contracted. There are four major actions only: Create a proposal, vote for a proposal (voting contract/B2C), support a proposal with a proposal (coalition contract/B2B), the member with the proposal of the most votes can edit an outcome document.

Majority rule implies that the minority loses or is suppressed. Democratic theorists have called this phenomenon the ""tyranny of the majority"". If, in contrast, everybody agrees, then there is no minority to be dominated. This is why deliberative democratic theory suggests to not simply count votes which express the self-interest of each, but rather to talk to each other until interests transform and converge.  Origins and Development  Consensus decision-making can be traced to the early forms of humanity. Hunters and gatherers made decisions within their tribes with the consent of all adult males, who gathered in a council, as Jane Mansbridge (1983) describes. Later, more competitive modes dominated the development of modern democracies with party competition and elections. Ideas of consensus were promoted by Anarchist movements in Europe in the 1960s and 70s. Student occupations of universities and the autonomous movement occupying deserted buildings also practiced and still practice forms of consensus decision-making. These practical experiences of consensus seeking also inspired current discussions of deliberative democracy.  How it Works  A consensus emerges when all participants or parties who are discussing a common problem agree on a solution or a course of action. Essentially consensus means agreement. If consensus is part of a  deliberative process , consensus-seeking implies that all participants talk for as long as it takes for common understandings to emerge and finding a solution that everyone thinks is the best regarding not only his or her own but everybody's interests. Consensus thus emerges if the discussion is oriented towards the common good. Participants need to be open learn from each other, immerse in the perspective of others and be willing to regard the interests of others as important as their own interests.Often the word consensus is, however, used in non-deliberative discursive contexts where negotiations along self-interests is the mode of communication. Here consensus can simply mean compromise – a solution all parties can accept in the face of no other solution that would benefit them more. This notion of consensus is at the heart of so called ""consensus democracies"" – democratic states in which workers' unions and other employee representatives on the one side negotiate political compromise with employer representatives on the other side as part of the legislative process.  Consensus is rather an outcome and a goal than a specific democratic tool. However, consensus is of major concern in some democratic innovations like  consensus conferences .  Analysis and Lessons Learned  While the advantages of consensus – to avoid a minority of ""losers"" and to promote reciprocal learning and understanding – are widely acknowledged, some disadvantages, however, also become apparent. So-called ""difference democrats"" criticize consensus for potentially benefitting stronger participants in discussions. If there is no clear vote that measures everyone's self-interest and if everyone is supposed to decide regarding the interests of others (common good) than those who are less confident and less articulate might be at a disadvantage. Charismatic and vocal participants might dominate the conversation. As a result, the consensus everyone agrees on in the end might be biased in the interest of more verbal participants.  Many empirical studies show, that women, ethnic and sexual minorities and other groups in society who suffer from a history of domination and suppression tend to be less verbal in discursive settings. On average, they tend to speak less and ask more questions instead of giving statements and may be more easily swayed by dominating participants.  Moreover, the orientation toward the common good tends to limit diversity of ideas, topics, and interests. Consensus seeking implies homogenizing tendencies. These tendencies are amplified through an understanding implicit in epistemic deliberative democratic conceptions that there is an objective best solution to any given problem. Thus, experts can more aptly find the best solutions with the help of science, which discovers objective truth. These implications of consensus lead into the direction of expert rule, which is, in the opinion of many, anything but democratic.

Origins and DevelopmentKnow how and why this method was developed? Help uscomplete this section! Participant Recruitment and Selection  The participants in citizen conferences are generally selected randomly to represent the diverse sets of opinions and demographics of a region (e.g. a State). These participants are usually ordinary citizens, not stakeholders or professional lobbyists. They voluntarily participate, are given a $200 honorarium post the completion of the event, and are called ""citizen advisors.""  There is a panel of experts present who have been selected by the government entity to represent a broad range of expertise on the specific sector being discussed. And, there is generally a government selected moderator who aids in the deliberation portion of the event.  Finally, concerned citizens may attend to observe and make brief statements during the question-and-answer session.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  A citizen conference is a one-day event and typically lasts from 8am to 5pm. Prior to attending, the citizen advisors are given a brochure to read that explains the purpose of the event and illustrates a set of government proposed policies or the sector (e.g. transportation) being discussed. If the government lists proposed policies, it is because they need fine tuning and the government entity would like to know which are most important to its citizens. If there are no proposed policies listed, the citizen conference allows for the advisors to come up with their own policies for a specific sector.  The event begins with breakfast and a  question-and-answer session . During the session, the citizen advisors are able to ask the expert panelists and concerned citizens' about the proposed policies or sector. After the session, the concerned citizens are able to make brief comments to the advisors and panelists. When there are no more comments, the citizen advisors take a lunch break.  After the lunch break, the citizen advisors head to a  deliberation  room (which is live streamed via a television for the panelists to observe) and start discussing their opinions on the sector, the proposed policies, and the newly absorbed information. During this deliberation, the moderator encourages the advisors to come up with  consensual  policy recommendations that meet the needs of all the citizens they represent. If necessary, the advisors may  consult  with the panel of experts to ask any final questions they might have.  Once the recommendations have been decided on, with the help of the moderator the advisors draft them and prepare to present them to the public and media. All the advisors then go to a location where a press conference can be held, and one of the advisors reads aloud the recommendations. After the recommendations have been announced to the public and media, the public and media are given time to ask the advisors questions about their opinions, policy choices, and experiences.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Citizen conferences may or may not be linked to any type of election. If they are not, it may be difficult to directly influence public officials. But, it should be noted that in many cases a citizen conference is the only basis for which a government entity can clearly hear its citizens' voices. Thus, the recommendations set forth by the advisors should persuade public officials. If they are linked to an election, a direct influence is more expected.

Government officials tend to come from a higher income, higher education strata of society. This renders insights and everyday perspectives of many citizens excluded from legislative processes.  Online consultations aim at including a wider public in legislative processes, increasing transparency of government activity, and moreover have a learning effect on participants. The main goal consists of making legislation accessible to a wider public and including insights and everyday knowledge from those affected by legislation.  Origins and Development  As the Internet gains popularity with the public for voicing opinion, citizen participation in policy development through cyberspace is changing the face of democracy. The rise of the Internet has given way to buzzwords such as e-democracy, referring to citizen participation in politics, government issues and policy development through  electronic technologies  and the Internet, and eGovernment, pertaining to providing citizens with government information and services online. Online consultation is an element of these concepts. Through online engagement, government is enabled to hold interactive dialogues with the public as they have a more direct route to citizen opinion via the Internet.  Countries like the  UK , Denmark,  Germany ,  Canada , the US-state California, and Australia can be considered leaders in the field. These and many other countries are integrating online consultations and engagement using various methods and for a range of purposes. The European Union also utilises online consultations. These complement face-to-face consultations and help to create greater transparency of the democratic process. Online consultations are also increasingly being used by the United Nations and its Specialized Agencies. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN hosts online consultations to allow for more inclusive drafting processes of policy guidelines, reports and strategy papers. The Global Forum on Food Security and Nutrition (FSN Forum) is tasked with carrying out many of these consultations.  How it Works  Online consultations or e-consultations refer to an exchange between government and citizens using the Internet. Online consultation consists in using the Internet to ask a group of people their opinion on one or more specific topics, allowing for trade-offs between participants. Generally, an agency consults a group of people to get their thoughts on an issue when a project or a policy is being developed or implemented, e.g. to identify or access options, or to evaluate ongoing activities. This enables governments to draft more citizen-centered policy.  In principle, most online consultation processes are completely open to everyone who wants to participate. However, governments initiating entities have some influence in targeting certain groups in population by advertising the consultation on websites frequented by certain societal groups. Moreover, some consultation processes might be might only include certain groups, like fora for victims of rape or sexual harassment sharing their experiences in order to influence new legislation in the field.Deliberation  mostly takes place in online fora provided by initiators. Here users can leave comments and react to the comments of others. Other quantitative features might be employed like  surveys  ranking preferences, or like and maybe even dislike buttons.  Voting  procedures between several options might also be employed.  Online consultations, like face-to-face consultations or written petitions, are of advisory character. They are meant to inform political decision makers of the public opinion, so they can take a considered decision.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Online consultations fruitfully make use of new means of online communication to make legislative processes more transparent and informed by public opinion. They can, however, be criticised from various angles.  First, while striving to include all strata of society and lowering the barrier for participation, the digital divide and digital inequalities show that the Internet might not be the right tool to do so. Several studies show that the people with higher income and education participate more than those with lower incomes and education, men more than women, young more than old, white more than those of other racial backgrounds. Thus outcomes of online consultation are heavily biased.  Second, as online consultation is only advisory, it is up to political decision makers to make the decision whether to execute outcomes of consultation or not. This might result in ""cherry picking"" with only those outcomes executed that would have been executed anyway, which implies faking participation in order to gain legitimacy.

 ""The Delphi technique is an alternative participatory method. Although it is based on iteration and feedback, it is less elaborate and resource‐intensive than  Deliberative Polling . In addition, unlike Deliberative Polling, the Delphi technique eschews face‐to‐face discussion in favor of repeated anonymous  surveys . The rationale for removing face‐to‐face discussion from a group decision process is that group dynamics can stifle creativity, inhibit dissent, and prevent all aspects of an issue from emerging.""

Policies should aim not to increase GDP but to increase well-being in society ”. The Council of Europe takes the same approach as that instilled by the Stiglitz Commission, summarized in this short extract. It is thus upstream of public policies, with the desire to ensure a new, more inclusive democracy, that the SPIRAL methodology (Societal Progress Indicators for the Responsibility of All), developed by the Social Cohesion Division of the CoE, is located . Since 2005, it has set itself the objective of ""ensuring the effective participation of the actors concerned, or at least of their recognized representatives"", in a new public sphere.  The deliberative methods exploring the levers of social cohesion and directly addressing citizens by including them in the decision-making process through consultation and deliberation, do not appear in the review of the academic literature on the issue. Political scientists and other researchers in social sciences, study and measure rather visible participatory actions, because “ordered from above”, which target a limited public.  For its part, the participatory method SPIRAL (  Societal Progress Indicators for the Responsibility of All)  of the Council of Europe (CoE), is based on the fight against inequalities and exclusion, by seeking to activate the economic optimum and social in our societies. This ""bottom-up"" method is unique in that it proposes to address directly to all citizens and not to groups already formed or to ""typical"" individuals. It also aims to develop partnerships, to constitute a “local public sphere”. The Council of Europe's SPIRAL deliberative methodology thus generates the creation of homogeneous groups of citizens, through consultation and discussion, on the opposing notions of well-being and ill-being. This approach allows the development of indicators, which can establish the conditions to reach the path of societal progress.  The SPIRAL deliberative method is thus based on the definition of the concept of co-responsibility by the actors themselves, manufacturers of the indicators of well-being in a first consultative phase called ""consultation"". The consultative process is built using 7 stages, which fulfill the normative criteria of deliberation (rationality, reciprocity, impartiality and universality). The SPIRAL methodology also tries to develop, with the help of deliberation, new instruments to measure social cohesion. During the process, when we move from the consultation phase to action by improving social ties, the operationalization stage risks remaining unclear and therefore ineffective. Thus, the evaluation of deliberative democracy is not limited to seeking its effect (s) in public policies. By developing a process through coordination groups, homogeneous groups and then rainbow groups, the SPIRAL methodology makes it possible to build a local public sphere, which offers the possibility of deliberating on current issues, with the possibility of continuing in the time. The originality of the method is that it integrates and applies an evolving concept: when an improvement is detected in practice (generating a multiplier effect), it is reproduced and integrated into the original scheme. The method must therefore be able to adapt to changes. Pilot actions (more than 1,600 actions for “living together” are currently listed, just for Wallonia), define framework projects and are evolving based on a participatory co-evaluation of the impact. We can thus presuppose a cyclical process fueled by objectives (normative frameworks), instruments (set in motion) and institutional frameworks (structure).  SPIRAL is thus located upstream of public policies, to anticipate problems and include citizens in the public sphere. Thus creating a parallel framework, this ingenious method can identify resources and other means of action, to “think outside the box” of the fabric of social innovation. The intergovernmental institution based in Strasbourg, has thus orchestrated experiences of this type throughout Europe and the world (France, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russian Federation, Sweden, likewise than in the Cape Verde Islands and Gabon for Africa and Turkey for Asia). This international experience aims to develop areas of co-responsibility, transposable across the continent, with the aim of creating a “welfare society”. This new vision, where the responsibility would be shared between all the actors and not only entrusted to the State, could be one of the answers to the current problems of exclusion and rising inequalities.  In his book  What is Integration  , Dominique Schnapper specifies that the  welfare  state has gone from an ""insurance"" system (before the oil shocks of the 1970s), to an ""assistant"" system and therefore stigmatizing. . This paternalistic position, making it possible to respond to targeted weaknesses without necessarily solving the basic problems, must evolve because it does not prevent either inequalities or social fractures from growing. In view of the global crisis, it is clear that post-industrial societies tend to turn to “social avarice”, a method which calls for restricting state aid and other subsidies, so as not to disrupt the work market. This theory, making it possible to reconnect with what was once called ""utilitarianism"" (a concept developed in 1789 by the British Jeremy Bentham), wishes to demonstrate that society is doing its best for the maximum number of people (the common interest is the sum of special interests) and that we must accept that the happiness of all is not achievable. This vision of society is opposed to that of the general interest, which goes beyond each individual and is in a way, in the light of the enlightened thought of the Enlightenment philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, ""  the emanation of the collective will of citizens  ”. The general will must however integrate particular interests, the role of the State having to be that of mediator, capable of carrying out the synthesis emanating from the members of the civil society, also encompassing the interests of future generations. Considering the social cohesion sought by the general interest as being the ultimate goal of the State, we can thus qualify the State as ""the architect of the social"". But the instrumentalization of public policies partly prevents the state machine and public and private decision-makers from “thinking” about social cohesion. Robert Putnam, working on the notion of social capital (  Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community  , New York, 2000), even describes a ""  weakening of the structures of sociability and the forms of an individualistic withdrawal, which lead to a decline. of trust between individuals and towards institutions  ”. At the same time, political actors often lack precise, serious, organized, structured and even usable information on the realities of daily life.  To create social cohesion, the production of rules (or regulation) would complement the efforts of individuals to integrate. In other words, individuals “include themselves”, rather than “integrate” into “public affairs”, both by  using  and by  creating  social norms. This is why, through this article, I propose to seek the inclusion of citizens through their participation in society, by forging the tools of deliberative democracy with the fundamentals of social cohesion, thereby giving it mechanisms for its operationalization. In addition, deliberation, which is not limited to a simple consultation of citizens, must aim to create social links in order to be effective. By favoring the deliberative method, the State would allow citizens, who after having discussed and reached a consensus, to develop their own indicators to participate in politics, thus avoiding instrumentalisation and manipulation. The CoE's deliberative SPIRAL method engages citizens who can participate in all cycles of progress, allowing from exchanges of point of view, seeking a consensus, to produce social actions for oneself and for others, modifying by even there their  attitude,  their  commitment  and thus allowing  inclusion  . This paradigm would be the foundation of a new community, visible through a local public sphere. All the reasons that we have just mentioned (overhaul of the State-society-economy partnership, search for the general interest, better information, legitimacy of the action, participation of all, confidence, changes in attitude, commitment and inclusion), would serve to convince decision-makers to complete their vertical approach to social cohesion, with an approach aimed at horizontal microsocial links between the actors of a territory. We can thus build our reflection around the following problem:  Is the deliberative method suitable to strengthen social cohesion at local and regional level?Origins and Development  Considering that ""  the definitions of the notion of social cohesion bring into play the representations that a society has of itself  "" (Guibet Lafaye 2011), it is clear that globalization and its economic and social consequences have modified the basic structure of the State and the vision of the relationship of societies to social cohesion. In view of the very gloomy picture of the current social architecture, we must more than ever demonstrate that the interests of the market and more generally of the economy, are not opposed to the protection of the poorest and most fragile. This is why integration should not be confronted in a primary way with forms of exclusion or other forms of stigmatization, but seek a co-responsible solidarity by recognizing, like the vision conveyed by the CoE, that any citizen can make his or her contribution (whatever it is) to society, through debates or organized deliberation.  The objective of co-responsible solidarity would be to build bridges to match the notion of social cohesion to the concept, thus allowing sustainability over time. This is why the methods of participatory democracy seem to be able to inspire a strong commitment to the citizen, who can build social ties, while nurturing a feeling of confidence. At this stage, we could propose an approach through that of “sustainable social cohesion”, which would be defined as “  the intrinsic capacity of a democratic society to share power, integrating current and future generations; the search for the inclusion of all through active participation, making it possible to build lasting bonds of belonging and to unearth new resources  ”. This is why social policies must more than ever include all citizens (those who participate, those who engage, but also the fragile categories, the marginalized), without stigmatizing them. This response may correspond to the current institutional movement, namely that which aims to activate greater power of participation and decision “from below”.  Deliberative democracy, as we understand it today, was developed using a socio-historical approach, by the German philosopher Jürgen Habermas and the American sociologist-historian Robert Sennet. Both defend the idea that “  the democracies of the XXth century. must be erected in a real and critical public space  ”. The latter explain the weakness of the democratic model in our current societies, by the decadence of this same “public space” and this, from the 19th century, at the time of the industrial revolutions. The transformation of society, leading to the decline of family values and the development of mass culture, would thus lead to the inability of individuals to develop a critical mind. This paradigm, called by Habermas the “  fetishism of the community  ”, unlocks a mechanism which makes that individuals gradually find themselves disconnected from the public sphere. The tools of this mechanism, which then formed the cog of the capitalist and industrial State of the XIXth and XXth centuries, go through the bureaucratization and the selection by the State itself, of its interlocutors (what we call today intermediate bodies).  Thus, deliberative democracy (when the state sphere is separated from that of citizens) is exercised through the active participation of individuals, who constitute a ""critical public opinion"". The mobilization and appropriation of questions by this new public sphere are developed with the help of the famous Principle of Discussion (known as “Principle D”), systematized by the philosopher of the Frankfurt school:  “According to ethics of discussion, a standard can only claim validity if all those who may be concerned agree (or could be) as participants in a practical discussion about the validity of that standard  ”. Deliberation is thus perceived as the result of agreements taken together, while leaving a possibility of openness for the future. The deliberative group formed can solve cross-cutting problems of today but also of tomorrow and meet the criteria of sustainable social cohesion, which we seek to forge. This system seems to create confidence, which is essential for developing the economic and social optimum. It has been instrumentalized by the political class through the notion of “  win-win”  and used to develop new public policy mechanisms.  Our approach is to integrate deliberation into a process of modification of the very nature of democracy, called by Loïc Blondiaux the ""new spirit of democracy"", or even ""a paradigm shift in the way of doing politics"" , according to Yves Sintomer and Julien Talpin.  Recruitment and Selection participant  SPIRAL ""  offers a framework, procedures and tools that make it possible to give back to citizens and actors of a territory the power to qualify the well-being in their living space, to measure its contours, to define on this basis action strategies and support the implementation of local action plans  ”(IWEPS Working Paper n ° 10). This is why the process must be carried out ""from below"": responsible and organized citizens call on the institution which in turn provides the tools.  These instruments fit into three sets:Transmit trends in social cohesion (conferences, reflections on the subject).  Develop appropriate indicators.  Propose a method of deliberative democracy that allows projects to be scaffolded.These devices are financed jointly by the European Union and the Council of Europe, which is responsible for implementing the whole. This partnership between the European institutions has made it possible to develop indicators which can all be measured by the States, falling within the general desire to probe the well-being of all, a notion that is both very broad and very personal. The originality of the approach is to integrate three levels of measurement, starting from the most general to go to the particular (societal capacities, areas of life and vulnerable groups). Its objective is to reach out to all individuals and to make fragile social categories (seeking social justice) as visible as trends in society or even public actions. These three “levels of integration”, which were developed directly by the participants, make it possible to provide criteria for the operationalization of social cohesion.  Could this originality not lead to fundamental problems? ""Starting from the bottom"", the SPIRAL method would run the risk of encountering a major contradiction, lying between the search for the general interest (defined in its methodology) and the defense of particular interests (which could be developed in homogeneous groups. who by nature defend their condition)? Indeed, citizens, through this interpretation of deliberation, may be led to focus on their personal problems (use of public places, problems linked to the residential area, to the nature of the homogeneous group), rather than the search for general interest (co-responsible society), even through the universal concept of “long-term well-being for all”. This limiting factor, lets us presuppose that the transposition of the methodology to a higher stratum (regional, national, continental or even global), seems complicated but should not, like Joseph Schumpeter in his published work  Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy.  in 1967, which considered ""ordinary"" citizens to be intellectually limited to local matters, proved impossible.  The empirical study of several municipalities in the Walloon region, which have been applying this method for some time, will perhaps allow us to confirm or invalidate the normative criteria for the operationalization of deliberation (attitude, commitment and inclusion). Article 23 of the 1994 Constitution of the Federal State of Belgium specifies “  access for all to fundamental rights  ”. By referring to the risk indicator produced by the Walloon Institute for the Evaluation of Foresight and Statistics (IWEPS), we note that “  compared to the Belgian average, a greater part of the Walloon population is exposed to the risks of poverty  ”. Moreover, the macro-social approach which aims to defend economic, social and cultural rights in Belgium is by nature incomplete, because as we have shown previously, wanting to apply fundamental rights ""from above"" is not enough. to make social cohesion effective. “Living together” must be complemented by the creation of horizontal interrelational links. This is why, as part of the “fight against poverty and inequalities”, the Walloon government created in 1992 the Interdepartmental Directorate of Social Cohesion (DiCS), which has since developed a coordinated approach both at the horizontal level ( local link), that at the vertical level (regional link). This approach, aimed at defending the fundamental rights of all Walloon citizens, has become effective and efficient through the Proximity Prevention Plan (2003-2008), which will be succeeded by the Social Cohesion Plan (PCS), with a duration of 5 years for the first part which ends this year. A device for social emancipation, it is inspired by the concept of social cohesion of the Council of Europe (the  capacity of a society to promote the well-being of all  ). The original SPIRAL method applied in Wallonia is a tool used by the Social Cohesion Plan, which makes it possible to coordinate and develop a whole set of initiatives within the municipalities, so that each person can live in dignity with reference to Belgian fundamental rights. , thereby creating a “territory of co-responsibility”. With the first PCS coming to an end in 2013, the new Social Cohesion Plan under construction for the period 2013-2019, currently lists 195 French-speaking Walloon municipalities, having responded favorably to the call for applications launched by the DiCS at the start of the year. 'year. This dynamic process, which interests the municipalities of the region, is based on a contract between private and public institutions and individuals, formalized by a  Partnership Agreement  . We will pay particular attention to the 14 pilot municipalities that participated in the deliberative project “  Concerted development of indicators of well-being in Wallonia  ”, orchestrated by the IWEPS and the CoE. This project will allow us to confront the SPIRAL method with the normative criteria of the deliberation for its operationalization, which seeks to activate social cohesion at the local and regional level. Our approach will consist of a critical vision of SPIRAL, seeking to verify:On the one hand, if deliberation makes it possible to create social links.  On the other hand, if these links are dynamic, through the different “levels” of social cohesion that we have defined previously.How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  After having listed 100 homogeneous groups from 14 coordination groups (or support committee) and archived on the wikispiral.org site, we can make a classification, using the name they have given themselves; It is useful to remember that the nature of the groups of deliberation, are constituted in a completely free way on the territory with the help of an approach ""from the bottom"". Thus, these homogeneous groups can be distributed according to the three levels of social cohesion defined by the CoE for an inclusive society:“Vulnerable groups”, defined in the 2005 methodological guide of the CoE as being: “minorities”, “migrants”, “children”, “elderly”, “people with disabilities”, “women”.  ""Areas of life""indicated by ""employment and activities"", ""income and purchasing power,"" ""housing and living environment"", ""health"", ""nutrition"", ""education "","" Information "","" culture "".  The base, formed by ""societal capacities"",marks the tendency to: ""ensure equity (fundamental rights)"", ""ensure dignity and recognition of diversity"", ""autonomy and personal development"", "" participation and engagement ”.Let us compare the 100 homogeneous groups of Wallonia, according to the three levels of social cohesion:  The groups representing “societal capacities” are the least numerous (15%). “Vulnerable groups” represent 23% of the total and “areas of life” are the most represented homogeneous groups with 55%. The results allow us to observe an over-representation of groups linked by “areas of life”, which can be described as “the most individual category”. From this typology, we can confirm that for all 14 pilot municipalities, the constitution of a “local public space” is effective: the three spheres of social cohesion are thus represented. There is nevertheless a tendency to reproduce the individualistic societal pattern through the distribution of groups, which demonstrates a predisposition to want to deliberate on the private sphere (relationship to society, areas of life). Nevertheless, the activation of a public sphere at the local level already makes it possible to relay the demands of the actors of the community, which are part of their relationship to the State, society or the economy. Participants should then be able to build social cohesion, using and creating new social norms. Based on this observation, we will test the method with regard to the criteria for its operationalization.  To be legitimate, deliberation must at all costs seek the general interest, which may be based on individual and / or community interests, which must however remain in the minority. Deliberation works when it enables a new public sphere to be activated, maintaining a partnership between the State, the economy and society. This is why, the search for the general interest as well as the inclusion of all (future generations included), are the two fundamental concepts, which can make the deliberation effective and generating social links, in a ""welfare society"" which structures “strong democracy”. In view of this information, let us hypothesize that the SPIRAL deliberation makes it possible to identify an attitude that would target the general interest, thus granting a commitment within the community and making it possible to achieve inclusion at the level of the local territory, or even regional.Personal ties: attitude.The attitude in the participation, thus touches the personal bonds and the intimate sphere: we will call this the  1st level of social cohesion  . The attitude of the participant must contribute to defining the criteria of the “  virtuous citizen  ”, who commits standards, values, initiatives, wishes, in the society which he observes and dreams. Let us test this theory with regard to the  first level of social cohesion  , which is found in family n ° 8 of the SPIRAL nomenclature, representing 16% of all the 16,000 well-being criteria developed through the 14 pilot municipalities (  The indicators are constructed from expressions of well-being and ill-being collected from citizens, gathered and structured within a nomenclature organized into eight families: 1) means of living; 2) the living environment and environment; 3) relations with institutions (public and private); 4) personal relationships; 5) societal balances; 6) personal balances; 7) feelings of well-being; 8 / values / attitudes and initiatives / commitments).  These criteria, which we can find on the CoE website wikispiral.org, allow us to study the frequency of indicators linked to the attitude of the “virtuous citizen”. Initially, these indicators will be classified according to their objectives, targeting either particular interests, or the general interest. This approach is fundamental in trying to determine the legitimacy and consistency of the SPIRAL approach, which defines itself as being jointly responsible.  The criteria do not all relate to the same “level of efficiency” for building social links. Thus,  the most individual attitude  such as, ""  work on oneself / self-respect  "", (Example of criteria expressed: ""  take the time to listen to yourself, get to know and respect yourself, do not set the bar too much. top, put certain problems into perspective ”)  , as well as“  private activities and initiatives  ”, (Example of criteria expressed: give oneself the means, embark on new projects, reserve time for my family and for myself, re-educate oneself, using my experience, my know-how ”), allow to create a favorable ground for social cohesion, but are part of an“ individualistic ”approach of search for well-being for oneself, or possibly for one's family and loved ones. Conversely, by observing criterion H07, “  dynamic, collective will  ”, (Example of criteria expressed: “  remain united to maintain achievements, invest in new technologies, think about future generations from an environmental point of view, think about sustainable development ”),  we then observe an optimal level of co-responsibility, sustainability and solidarity, aimed at the general interest. These examples, placed at the “antipodes” (H01 and H07), are revealing of  the attitude aiming to seek well-being for oneself  and  well-being for all  . The frequency of the criteria of the H family, expressed by category (H01 to H07), could allow us to identify a dominant or even a variation of the attitude, to assess its qualitative aspect. Using the search engine provided by the wikispiral.org site, we identified and classified a total of 2491 criteria, about the well-being approach, emanating from the 13 coordination groups in Wallonia (the indicators developed by the Braine l'Alleud coordination group are not yet available). We can now engage, among the 7 indicators appearing in the H family (  values / attitudes and initiatives / commitments  ),  642 criteria  which establish an attitude aimed at personal well-being and therefore  particular interests  (H01-H02) and  1849  (H03-H04-HO5-HO6-H07) which aim at  the general interest  , with regard to a virtuous attitude on the well-being of all.  We note that the search for the common good by the participants is a largely majority trend with about 3⁄4 of the criteria falling into this category. This information makes it possible to identify the “universal” character of the attitude of the participants, who seek the general interest, making it possible to legitimize the process. Let us nevertheless refine this one, by observing what happens, when we distribute the criteria according to the seven indicators of the family H:Community ties: participation through engagement.Engagement in the field activates community ties and the  second level of social cohesion  . This level allows participants to confront the ""  time of democracy  "" and other issues of partners in our ""new local public sphere"". We can assume that this  2nd level of social cohesion  will create links between the various partners and actors of the co-responsible territory through the rainbow groups, which we will analyze through the leverage and multiplier effects sought. Adrien Fiévet, head of the PCS of Liège, warns us during a telephone interview, in view of his experience in the field, of the possible disinterestedness of citizens after the first phase of social cohesion: “  We must be careful with this approach. : the citizens say I am given the floor, I noted the problem and you (the municipality) do nothing. It is not deliberative democracy: we raise the problem in the neighborhood, we activate the principle of co-responsibility, participation and credibility of actions by putting people around the table. The solutions require joint action, including with the municipal authorities. Find a collective response to a local problem. This whole process is being built and takes months: we have to educate individuals. It's a complicated job that requires experience, a good knowledge of people. We have to find the right contacts among the population. The time of democracy is not known by the population: it is a very long procedure (the creation of a pedestrian crossing requires important steps which consist in contacting the town planning department, the municipal council, in within the framework of the regulations in force and can sometimes take 6 months) ”.  The citizen, after having developed an attitude conducive to creating a social bond, must then confront the commitment, to match his words with his actions and thus test the application of his ideas. This phase can thus be operationalized through standard actions, creating links between people, but also with the State and the economic world. The criteria for the plurality of groups that get involved (leverage effects), as well as the external impact of actions (multiplier effects), established by the academic world and desired by the CoE, are the normative criteria, so that this phase is effective in terms of creating the community social bond.Leverage effects and their limits: activate the partnership.Through the engagement of the participants-deliberators, the links between the social and the economy are put to the test and make it possible to activate the “leverage effect”. For Samuel Thirion, of the CoE's social cohesion division:  “It is clear that when we talk about social cohesion we have an impact on the economy. We cannot separate the social and the economic. This is the case when we improve the situation of a person in a phase of exclusion, who has lost his place in society, that we find a place for him either through an unpaid activity or a job. (...) A co-responsibility approach makes it possible to reach resources which in a classic market approach are not ""touchable"", because those who have them do not make them available, because they are only used for one thing. . For example, carpooling, social taxis, the use of free spaces to make them into shared gardens, the recovery of all agricultural surpluses thrown in the trash to redistribute them, the recovery of medicines (in Greece there is a social pharmacy that collects drugs in people)  ”. The leverage effect thus makes it possible to free up new resources that were unsuspected at the time, thanks to the commitment of different groups of citizens who find solutions, using their complementarity. This phase can make it possible to create social links between groups that might never have met and unearth new resources, which can be found outside the traditional economic and social circuits. The resources released must however be used wisely, with the help of precise and complementary indicators: “  It is important not to confuse the population and the territory. The concentration of resources in areas of low socio-economic status can benefit very unequally the different categories of the population often opposed by contradictory interests. In the absence of adequate regulations on the housing market, the use of these means to improve public spaces and buildings can lead to price increases and compromise the retention of the most vulnerable socio-economically inhabitants, or induce degradation. their living conditions in terms of housing or sociability. However, such strategies, based on public-private partnerships, and without restriction as to the recipients of the housing produced, tend to take precedence in Wallonia over the old integrated endogenous approaches  ”(Territorial diagnosis of Wallonia 2010, p.42). The limits of leverage effects are thus clearly exposed through this example. In order not to stray from the general interest (well-being of all), actions must continually adopt an inclusive approach and therefore integrate the possible consequences of actions, against fragile social categories, depending on the territory. Remember that what we measure is what we seek to achieve.Multiplier effects.All of the actions were listed in the 2010 DiCS Report, under “  140 social cohesion plans which bring together more than 1,600 actions ac",1,0,0,2,0,

Social networks have greatly contributed in re-shaping the idea of online interactions, but their outcomes are, most of the time, a clashing chorus of lonely voices unable to listen to each other giving rise to unfruitful exchanges of ideas. From this point of view, web-mediated interactions are still far from being efficient means of communication, confrontation and, in the end, a means for effective decision making.  It’s from the analysis of current practices in online interactions that Deebase was developed: a content management system (CMS) aimed at supporting communities in fostering the exchange of ideas among their members, turning chaotic interactions into full-fledged debates. In Deebase, members of a community - whether pre-existing or newly emerging - can engage in online discussions about specific themes, compare their ideas with those of others, rank them and finally vote for their favorite ones. The whole process is supported by the use of gamification techniques which should, on the one hand, improve users’ engagement while on the other hand transform the confrontation as a deliberate act into an exciting game-like process. In developing Deebase, its designers have envisaged three potential targets which could benefit from the adoption of the platform: online communities, private companies and public administrations.  Related tools are  ConsiderIt  ,  Electronic Direct Democracy  ,  Wikivote  ,  e-Deliberation  , and  Online Voting  .  Origins and DevelopmentKnow how this tool or technique was developed? Help us complete this section!How it Works  Good ideas are not produced by any sort of linear process, rather they emerge from the sparse, unpredictable and sometimes harsh confrontation between people. It’s during this chaotic process that people come up with big ideas, pieces of knowledge shaped by the collective contributions of all the participants interacting. But because of its complex nature, the outcomes of such confrontations are as valuable as unpredictable.  It was from this question idea of Deebase was developed, an online platform aimed at supporting online deliberative processes, harnessing the collective creativity springing up from online interactions.  The deliberative process is very different from the discussion process; the difference between deliberation and decision is fundamental but often overlooked and the two terms are considered interchangeable. Deliberation is a complex process in which ideas are generated, mixed, compared, measured, tested and finally voted. Deliberation is, first of all, an act of collective creativity in which everyone, often unconsciously, plays a fundamental role. When dealing with deliberative processes we are not primarily interested in solving the problem of how to choose the best answer among a set of pre-defined alternatives. Rather, our main interest in is in finding-out how individuals, groups, communities come to imagine alternative routes to navigate the future.  But how can a web-platform facilitate online deliberative processes? Deebase allows users to express their ideas about an issue to be analyzed, facilitates the comparison between different ideas and finally lets the audience decide which is the best answer addressing the topic under evaluation. The whole process is bounded by a set of rules perfectly balanced to preserve the complexity of multiple interactions while allowing community managers to master them. An underlying Gamification system incentivizes users to express, defend and explain their ideas to other participants, rewarding them with badges and point attesting their expertise in different subjects. The whole discussion and deliberation process can also be propelled beyond the border of the platform thanks to the integration of Deebase with major social networks. In this manner Deebase can identify, for each issue, the most supported ideas, their social footprints and also keep track of opinion movements over time. At the end of each deliberation process, community managers can access both quantitative and qualitative data generated by users, allowing them to perform analysis aimed at better comprehend which are the most popular ideas in their communities and why.  The potential applications of the platform are primarily online communities, private companies and public administration. An online community - for instance the readers of a popular online newspaper - could use Deebase to stimulate discussions around daily news in a more structured way than in traditional discussion boards. Structuring discussions according to the Deebase deliberative scheme would allow community managers and editors to have a clear view about readers’ reactions to articles published by the journal. This could help editors in understanding the journal’s audience, elaborate real time statistics and use data generated by the platform to further stimulate the debate around the discussed topics.  Deebase can find application also in different settings such as private companies and Public Administrations. In the first case the platform, thanks to its deliberative function, can be used as a decision-making support tool, stimulating the debate among employees in a semi-informal web environment. From this standpoint Deebase can merge the richness of the bottom-up approach, made of numerous, unpredictable and otherwise imperceptible relations, with the efficiency of the top-down approach. As an example, a company could adopt Deebase as an internal tool aimed at collecting innovative ideas about new products to be developed or new production processes to be adopted. Finally, Public Administrations could use Deebase a new means of communication between Local Government agencies and citizens. Thanks to its deliberative function, intimately integrated with social networks, Deebase could become a useful tool for policy makers willing to test the power of participative policy-design. For instance, a City Council could use Deebase not just as a tool for spotting problems and areas of interventions - a function already performed by polls - but also as a mean for identifying solutions to the identified issues, crowdsourcing knowledge from citizens.  Driven by the idea of creating new modalities of online interactions, Deebase's developers envisioned a very easy to use web-platform for e-deliberation. The whole process begins with a question which addresses an issue to be collectively debated. Members of the community can join the platform and submit a proposal about how they would proceed in order to solve the issue. Once they join the debate, a user can:interact with the already expressed ideas, extending them  add new ideas competing with the ones already expressed or  simply cast their vote for an already expressed opinion without adding further elements to the discussion.Support to an idea can be expressed through the internal voting system or through social signals; thanks to the integration of Deebase with major social networks, people can support an idea simply sharing it on Facebook, Twitter or Google Plus. This can also contribute in extending the outreach of the discussion beyond the boundaries of the platform triggering a viral effect on social networks - which means more participation and more hype around the discussion topic. At the end of each “challenge” - all questions are time limited - the most supported opinion is elected as the winning one. In this manner it is possible to identify for each issue the most supported solution, its popularity across major social networks, the main “reasons why” behind the winning (and also the non-winning) ideas. Accordingly, users taking part in the debate are rewarded according to their contribution to the discussion. The reward system, based on points and badges, on one side keeps users engaged in the platform, on the other allows community managers to identify top contributors and influencers. All data generated by the platform can be exported and further analyzed by community managers allowing them to understand who are the members of their community, which are the most popular ideas, who are the influencers, how opinion movements generate and evolve over time.  Technically speaking, the platform will be distributed as Software as a Service (SaaS). This means that each installation of Deebase will be tailored around customer's needs; No updates and management costs, as service providers we will take care of all the technical aspects from installation to customization and maintenance, so that customers and their community managers could focus on contents. Distributing Deebase as SaaS also means that it could be used in many different contexts. For this reason the platform has been developed keeping in mind that it should be: easy to use, flexible and scalable. With easy to use we do not just mean graphically appealing and user-centered but also that interaction dynamics have to be simplified to the utmost. Keeping interaction modalities as-simple-as-possible would definitively contribute in lowering adoption barriers, maximizing the basin of attraction of the platform. Submitting an idea, commenting or casting a vote should as easy as sharing a post on Facebook or send a Tweet. In order to further reduce adoption obstacles, we’re also working on developing a mobile app of Deebase that will allow users to join the deliberative process and cast their votes simply tapping the screen of a smartphone or of a tablet.  Moreover, Deebase has been designed in order to be flexible and scalable. Scalability is not just the capability of a platform to expand while maintaining the original performances and characteristics. Scalability can be interpreted also as the ability of a platform to be replicated in different environments, to adapt to peculiar contexts and needs while maintaining its basic structure. Deebase thanks to its distribution model and its cloud-based technical architecture can meet both requirements: adaptability to different contexts and scalability to high volumes.

Democs is an interactive and engaging process to support deliberation, learning, and possible conclusive decision making. As a  deliberation  method, Democs is not only about innovations that produce policy recommendations but also aims to bring citizens together to deliberate on public issues. Democs allows individuals to learn or extend their knowledge on complex issues, to share their experiences and values and to understand the experiences and values of others.  Democs relies on increased citizen capacity and engagement. Elitist democratic theorists argue that average citizens lack the political and intellectual capacity to engage and make decisions concerning national and foreign issues. For Schumpeter, citizens can rationally judge in their professional and private spheres, however concerning political issues citizens lack 'effective individual volition and command of facts'.[1] In this view, citizens lack responsibility, knowledge and are easy to manipulate by outside forces, because political affairs are so removed from the majority of people's lives. As Fishkin and Laslett note, the public's most basic political knowledge is appalling by any standards. One explanation is that what Downs et al. call 'rational ignorance'.[2] For the average citizen, it is too costly and time consuming to become well-informed for most complex policy questions. Yet citizens are confident that their opinion is unlikely to make any difference, hence they rationally choose to be ignorant.  Democs focuses not only on sharing views but also on providing access to accurate, balanced and clear actual information. Fishkin argues that a 'measure of reasonable democratic decision is what would people decide if they were informed'.[3] The design of Democs is based on deliberation without experts hence its avoids 'audience democracy' -passivity and one way-interactions.[4] Game materials are created in advance by experts with the aim to 'manage cognitive load'.[5] Introducing information on a new and complex subject can create difficulties; as a result, information is presented in ‘bite size’ chunks on various sets of cards that present a collection of view points. Participants do not require preparation which makes participation more open and accessible.  Origins and Development  Democs was created by the New Economic Foundation (nef) in 2001 due to growing interest in engagement with public through deliberative practices.  Democs was to be used as part of mass national campaigns on  ICT  and the NHS such as Who Sees What? and was a part of a self-initiative  for schools , grass-roots organisations or individuals for educational purposes.  Currently Democs is adapted for use across Europe through PlayDecide- a web-based project where Democs on science topics are available for download.[6]  How it Works  Democs is innovative as a method of engagement with the wider public as it is more open to participation compared to traditional methods such as  citizens juries  which require invitation. Designed for small groups, this ensures that a would-be inaccessible location is not an obstacle as it can be played everywhere, from the community centre, classroom, to a cafe or somebody's living room. Democs is flexible as it can be adapted to any age and for a variety of complex issues - from discussion on stem cell research for schoolchildren to synthetic biology discussions for adults. Besides, in contrast to most public engagement activities such as citizens’ juries and  deliberative polling , where participation is by invitation-only and not by interest, Democs gives an opportunity to lower formal barriers of entry and to open new spaces for anyone who would like to take part. Democs can be used under an umbrella of one project or organisation or even an interested individual, hence discussions can be held within their existing social networks.  The design of the game, complete with simple instructions is made with the intention to give people confidence to organise their own events.[7] This can be especially attractive for engaging a hard-to-reach group. Game design avoids passivity and promotes collaboration through engagement in social issues through themes, narratives, roles, settings, and character. Due to its design, deliberation takes place without experts or facilitators which creates an informal and relaxed atmosphere. Democs provides a familiar structure and a safe space that will appeal to inexperienced participants. For example, 93% of participants of the Democs programme by the Welcome Trust, agreed that, ‘I felt safe to say what I felt and thought’.[8]. By embracing openness through design, Democs makes it possible to engage with a significantly larger numbers of participants.  Democs kits for the games are downloadable online, including on the Play Decide site in a range of European languages on various topics. [6]  The game usually takes 60 to 90 minutes among small groups of people (between 5-9 players). Each Democs kit includes a deck of cards representing key facts, opinions and examples about a particular topic.  The process takes three stages:  The first stage is learning. Citizens discover a given story card in which they explore an imaginary narrative of people who are affected by an issue. Then, citizens evaluate the importance of each card and key issues which encourage them to critically engage with the meaning of the information. In the end, citizens absorb a full range of information and viewpoints available.  The second stage involves analysing the chosen cards when citizens categorise them in groups and look for linkages among them. Citizens are expected to agree or disagree on the meaning which would lead to a discussion. In this phase, citizens should have explored and gathered information, and started to think about the implications.  In the third stage, citizens apply their knowledge to make a decision according to the purpose of the event. The most commonly used approach is when in the end of the game citizens vote and rate a particular policy position. In the end citizens try to formulate a consensus position in that they can find some level of agreement.[7]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Democs does not only produce policy recommendations but also has an educational role and potential - 'an opportunity for citizens to develop their political knowledge, skills and virtues' which will improve the character of public opinion.[9] Citizens can participate in Democs without prior knowledge or preparation. For example, Democs was used in a  one year project (April 2005-March 2006) in secondary schools  with 1,189 participants. The aim was to enhance the ability of students to understand and discuss complex scientific issues such as neuroscience, GM food and stem cell research. The results showed that by playing Democs 81% of students enhanced their scientific knowledge, 63% of students thought that they understood more about contemporary scientific decision making and ethical issues, and 70% of students had been able to evaluate the impact of scientific developments or processes on people, communities or the environment. This experience helped to involve students who didn’t take a science as a subject and allowed informality in order to encourage to participate.[10]  In another example, Democs was used by the Welcome Trust under the Medicine in Society programme, with an aim to increase knowledge about particular issues and to incline more citizens to take part in public affairs. 350 people participated from October 2001 to January 2003 during the campaign. Understanding of views different to their own increased for 70% of participants, more sympathy for 25%, and a large majority of participants identified dilemmas in their feeling for others.[10] For 82 participants of Democs sessions on synthetic biology, for participants who didn't have knowledge of the issue prior to play, Democs opened up questions on the issue, while for those already with some knowledge of the issues Democs aided them in understanding deeper ethical issues involved.[11]  In general, evaluations suggest that Democs 'promotes collective learning', ‘the development of a greater appreciation for the diversity of opinions and the complexity of the issues'.[12] Furthermore, Democs produces confidence and an interest to continue investigation in explored subjects and for participants to take further action.[5]  Democs therefore has the potential for the 'development of political agency and consciousness' and 'self transformation'.[13] Citizens who are empowered by such participation in decision making processes are subject to transformative effects on their power of thought, feeling and action. Pateman describes this as citizens receiving 'social training'- how to be public as well as private citizens.[14] Citizens would become more tolerant to difference, knowledgeable, sensitive to reciprocity, and cooperative as increased democracy transforms individualist and conflicting interests into common interest.[13] Participation allows the development of democratic skills as well as having a psychological effect. The role of education is to restore citizen capacity to act.[15] Individuals will feel that he/she is making an impact, hence it is 'worthwhile to perform civil duties'. This would lead to an increase the use of consensus as tool for political interaction rather than power. As Warren states, democracy is necessary to the values of self-development, autonomy, and self-governance.[13]  There are some limitations in outcomes that are representative of ‘public’ opinion for policy making. Democs main emphasis on grass-roots organisation might have drawbacks. The most successful events were run by members of the community or voluntary sector which offers new ways of public engagement through civil society rather than traditional ways through formal political processes. However, unless Democs is played under a national program when a large enough number of games have been played, it does not allow sample the population in order to achieve representation of result.  Furthermore, voluntary participation might not always produce full data to include into the the overall data under national program[11] There was some difficulty with attracting citizens for playing Democs on more complex subjects such as synthetic biology as more groups of scientists took part, hence there is possible need of leadership through community centres or other organisations to reach citizens. Democs is better suited for grass roots organisations to create their own consensus which can be an incentive for action or to create an opportunity for development of shared co-ordination with other organisations. Democs would benefit from providing more information on follow-up action, debriefings, or be used by activist organisations in order to create support for possible action.  Despite being less resource consuming, Democs is time consuming to develop despite this, hence it would not be suitable for deliberation of urgent issues for community groups or policy makers.  Democs has the possibility to have a significant impact on policy making under a large national programme, as it would be more representative. As for grass-roots organisations Democs has an educational value as the response of participants shows, that deliberation through Democs has the potential to help groups to develop a shared understanding of issues that can offer a platform for communal action.

The first experiences were implemented by the Ville de Québec in 1993, in order to get the citizens more closely involved in municipal politics. The concept was extended to the whole city territory in 1997. Today, Québec city hosts no less than 28 neighborhood councils, each of them being an independent legal corporation mandated to give advice to the city council and to initiate different projects in its area. 
 Origins and Development 
 The neighbourhood council project started to emerge in the mid-70s, with the formation of a new progressive political party on the Québec’s municipal scene: the Rassemblement populaire de Québec (Quebec Popular Rally, RPQ). 
 The creation of the RPQ was a reaction to the unpopular decisions of the Parti civique de Québec (Québec Civic Party) and to the important urban redevelopment that was taking place during the 60s and the 70s. During this time, entire neighbourhoods were destroyed or converted so as to allow for the construction of buildings, highways, commercial centres, etc. Some major projects like the construction of the Parliament hill and the Dufferin-Montmorency highway provoked the demolition of hundreds of properties. 
 In the early 70s, a group of scholars of the Université Laval published an impressive study revealing the effects of the urban redevelopment and illustrated the indulgence of municipal elected officials towards the real estate developers. The study became an ideological reference for many groups of citizens, and the idea of a new political party flourished. A manifesto appealing to the mobilisation of the working class was issued in 1976, and the RPQ was officially created in 1977. 
 The new party proposed a radical democratisation of the municipal structures with the establishment of neighbourhood councils. These democratic tools were supposed to enable citizens to resist to the power of capital and to protect their neighbourhoods. Twelve years and four municipal elections later, the RPQ came to power in 1989. The first neighbourhood councils took shape in 1993.

 The neighbourhood councils have the status of non-profit organizations. They are autonomous legal corporations constituted by the Ville de Québec. This particular characteristic allows the councils to bypass the city mandate and to initiate actions on their own. Every citizen of a neighbourhood is member ex officio of its council. 
 To form a council, 300 citizens of a neighbourhood (Québec city is composed of 8 boroughs and 35 neighbourhoods) have to sign a request. The city council then authorizes the holding of a special meeting during which the neighbourhood population is invited to vote secretly for or against the creation of a new council. If a majority of citizens support the project, a new meeting is called to elect a board of directors. 
 The board of directors is composed of 11 voting members, which are distributed as follows: Four women and four men elected by the neighbourhood population for two-year terms 
 Three people appointed by the elected directors for one-year terms The elected directors serve on an individual basis and do not represent any particular group. In addition to these 11 members, the city councillors whose districts are within the neighbourhood limits can attend the council meetings without voting. The board of directors normally holds a meeting once a month. ConsultationThe neighbourhood councils (NCs) are invited to submit opinions to the executive committee on many areas of municipal responsibility. The city must submit any draft plans to amend or adopt a planning-related bylaw to the NCs. This includes decisions about planning, zoning, traffic, etc. Currently, the consultation is used in many other fields, such as security, housing, environment and even budget priorities. The consultation is usually done before the decisions are taken, so the citizens’ voice can have a real influence. According to the observations of scholars, neighbourhood councils’ advice is taken into consideration 80% of the time. 
 Consultation can take place in two ways. The city may consult only the board of directors of a neighbourhood council with a request for opinion, which generally concerns issues of minor importance. Or, when the topic is of greater importance, the entire neighbourhood population is consulted. A notice calling for a public consultation is published in the local newspapers and on the city website. Information about the consultation and the proposed solutions are distributed by mail to every resident. At the assembly, the city then presents a solution A and a solution B to the citizens. Finally, in the light of the citizens’ interventions and opinions, the board members formulate recommendations to the city (which may be a solution C). These recommendations are strictly advisory. InitiativeAs autonomous legal corporations, the NCs are also free to initiate consultations on their own and to formulate unsolicited advice to the executive committee. They can also organize activities to stimulate the life of their neighbourhood: festivals, concerts, etc. 
 NCs also participate in the development of a neighbourhood master plan, which serves as an orientation and planning document with direct and short-term impacts within the neighbourhood. Once this master plan has been elaborated, neighbourhoods can receive special budgets from the city to realize projects that it established as priorities (Parks, public squares, etc.).

 Analysis and Lessons Learned Clash of visionsIn the early 90s, the idea of neighbourhood councils was not well received by everybody. Two visions were firmly opposed to each other. For some people, the project was seen as a waste of time. Consultations would be expensive, long and fruitless. By promoting such a reform, RPQ was only proving its fear of duly exercising power. 
 To persuade the sceptics of the legitimacy of this new approach, two NCs pilot projects were launched in 1993. This first experience lasted two years, during which citizens, elected officials and civil servants learned to deal with the concept, identifying the problems and proposing ameliorations. 
 This adaptation period was a key condition of success for the NCs in Quebec City. It led to the conciliation of the two opposed visions. On the one hand, the realisation of successful projects and the collaboration between the city council and the NCs proved the value of the new approach. On the other hand, citizens were almost unanimous in their belief that NCs should remain consultative and not decisional, so the elected officials would keep their traditional role. CollaborationOver time, a fruitful collaboration developed between NCs’ members and city councillors. The councillor can help the citizens in the definition of their projects by providing information and sharing his or her experience. On the other side, many councillors believe that the NCs help them to better serve their constituents. NCs are their “eyes and ears” on the ground. DemocratisationWithout a doubt, NCs gave citizens more influence in the development of their neighbourhoods. However, the experience showed some of its limitations 20 years after it was first implemented. Only a few citizens regularly attended the board of directors’ meetings. The participation is higher at the time of public consultation (between 50 and 400 persons), but the question remains: are NCs really acknowledged by the population as a democratic tool? 
 The elections held in 2012 showed how difficult it was for NCs’ advocates to get new citizens involved. Depending of the neighbourhoods, between 5 and 75 people attended the annual assemblies. Only one third of the NCs were able to elect a full 8-member board. A quarter of them barely made the quorum of five members, and at least two had to hold another election because they didn’t reach quorum.6 
 Nevertheless, the structure appears to be here to stay. In 2011, Mayor Régis Labeaume faced opposition when he wanted to modify the NCs’ boundaries to harmonise them with the 27 districts boundaries. Many citizens resisted the project and made their case heard. The reform was finally abandoned.7

 Enshrined in Montreal's Charter, the Right to Initiate Public Consultations “empowers citizens to propose new and constructive solutions or innovative and mobilizing projects in order to meet the issues and challenges of their city by obtaining a public consultation following a petition.”1 However, the result of the process “has no decisional character”.1 
 Origins and Development 
 The Right to Initiate Public Consultations is one of the key projects developed by the Task Force on Democracy, a working group formed in 2002 in the midst of the municipal merger and the Montreal Summit. The Task Force is composed mainly of citizens who participate on a personal level, without the involvement of organizations. It is accountable to the mayor and aims to promote collaboration and cooperation between civil society and the city. The Right of Initiative was designed to this end. 
 The Right was adopted by the Montréal city council in September 2009 and has been in effect since January 1, 2010. Two public consultations have emerged from the Right of Initiative since it was implemented in 2010; one about the “state of urban agriculture in Montreal” and another about “the sharing of the existing bike path network”. 
 How it Works 
 Participants are self-selected. While the draft petition must have at least 25 signatories, each has chosen to sign under their own volition. As well, three signatories must serve as representatives of the group. The selection of these individuals depends on the organization of the group. The PetitionThe exercise of the Right to Initiate Public Consultations begins with the filing of a draft petition. This draft petition must clearly and briefly state the object of the proposed consultation, justify the desirability of the consultation and be signed by at least 25 people including three signatories designated to serve as representatives of the group. 
 Within 15 days of the draft petition being judged admissible by the concerned authorities, a notice is given to announce the beginning of a petition signing period. To obtain a public consultation, groups must obtain a required number of signatures within the following 90 days. A total of 15,000 signatures are required for proposals that concern a central city matter. (As of 2011, Montréal had a population of 1.65 million people.) In the case of a borough, 5% of the population, up to a maximum of 5,000 signatures, has to sign the petition. (Population varies from borough to another. More than 160,000 people live in Cote-des-Neiges--Notre-Dame-de-Grace, but only a little more than 20,000 in Outremont.) To give young people “an opportunity to become involved with municipal affairs”2, the city of Montreal allows every person aged 15 years and over to participate to the process. The ConsultationOnce the required number of signatures has been collected, a public consultation must be held within a reasonable delay. 
 In the case of a public consultation bearing on a borough matter, the authority responsible for holding the consultation is the borough council, one of its committees, any committee or group of designated persons, as the council concerned may choose. 
 Where the city is concerned, the consultation is held by one of the council committee or by the Office de consultation publique de Montréal (OCPM), an independent public organization whose mission is to carry out public consultation mandates entrusted to it by the Ville de Montréal city council or executive committee. 
 The public consultation takes place in two parts. During the first part, representatives of the city or borough present information and answer questions from citizens. This is when those who have submitted the request will be required to explain the reasoning behind their request for a public consultation. In the second part, which takes place at least 15 days later, everyone gets the opportunity to express an opinion or submit a brief. 
 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 Those in charge of the consultation have to publish a written report within 90 days following the end of the proceedings. The document will itemize all concerns and opinions expressed at the hearing, analyze the proposals and draw conclusions or formulate recommendations, but will not render a decision. Then, the borough council or city council will inform citizens of the findings of the public consultation and, depending on the case, announce decisions that may be made and the reasons behind them. 
 The Montreal Charter of Rights and Responsibilities allows a maximum of three public consultations to be held per year by the city as part of the Right of Initiative, and two public consultations per year by each of the boroughs. 
 Furthermore, certain matters are ineligible and will not be considered for public consultation if they concern, for example: the sharing of powers, or the governance or the status of the city 
 administrative organization or contracts management 
 budget, fees or taxes 
 an urban development project for which a public consultation or approval by referendum has already been prescribed by law 
 a project that has already been submitted for public consultation within the previous three years 
 a call for tenders, pending or completed, or for which a contract has already been awarded 
 a matter pending before the court or a matter that was the object of a judgment, or an out-of-court settlement. See Also

One of its hallmarks is that the facilitator acts as an "" empathetic listener "" throughout the process [2]. In addition to intensive use of active listening and ""we-flection"" with each participant, other key aspects include:Welcoming ""initial solutions"" as prototypes  Working with multiple divergent problem definitions for an extended period of time  Creating a safe space for both creative and critical thinking to occur simultaneously, by having participants direct critical comments to the facilitator, where they are reframed as 'concerns'  Close mapping of each participant's contribution using four charts: solutions, concerns, data, and problem-statements[3]Within the realm of public participation, Dynamic Facilitation has been used within group  deliberations  on challenging public policy issues as the core ""operating system"" in the  Vorarlberg Bürgerrat model , a format derived from Jim Rough's original  Wisdom Councils  [4].  Dynamic Facilitation is most suited to public engagements which seek to give community members a deeper appreciation of an issue's complexity, to engage in creative thinking about the issue, and to experience the heightened sense of agency, meaning, and possibility that arise from authentic discourse [5]. Outside of public participation projects, Dynamic Facilitation has been used as an effective way to support the evolution of organizational cultures [6].  Origins and Development  Jim Rough originally developed Dynamic Facilitation to address challenging workplace issues with shop floor employees in paper mills and lumber mills in the Pacific Northwest. [7] He then developed the  Wisdom Council  as a large-group application of this method, and used it successfully within several large organizations. [8] His Wisdom Council model has been used most extensively in the state of Vorarlberg in Austria , where the Office of Future-Related Issues (renamed in 2020 as the Office for Voluntary Engagement and Participation) enhanced the original model with some of their own adaptations, and found it to be an effective approach for conducting public participation projects [9].  Outside of public participation projects, Dynamic Facilitation is also being used within organizational contexts in German-speaking countries [10].  How it Works  The participants in a group that is working with Dynamic Facilitation engage in a creative exploration of an issue. Divergent and challenging perspectives are welcome but are directed toward the facilitator. This reduces the confrontational nature of the exchange so participants feel safe to consider and share new or divergent perspectives. [11]  The process evokes shared understandings and breakthroughs, rather than decisions among a fixed set of possibilities. A ""meeting of the minds"" (and hearts) is a typical outcome, although of course one cannot predict the particular area on which the group will arrive at their spontaneous convergence. [12]  In the public policy applications, a ""microcosm group"" or mini-public explores an issue in a sequestered process, much like a jury but aided by an expert facilitator. At the conclusion of their work, participants share their findings at a large public gathering. Usually the gathering is run as a  The World Café , to allow for public response, and in-depth questioning and consideration on the group's findings. [13]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The use of Dynamic Facilitation has been explored as part of two different evaluations of Vorarlberg's experiences with Bürgerräte (Citizens' Councils or Civic Councils derived from the Wisdom Council model).  In 2012, an evaluation was published by the European Institute of Public Participation along with Kairos, with the outcomes of a qualitative research study that had been commissioned by Vorarlberg's then-Office for Future-Related Issues (Büro für Zukunftsfragen). [14]  In 2014, an ""Interim Report"" was published by that same office, that included the outcomes of interviews and  focus groups  with past participants in these Councils. [15]  In 2016, Hans Asenbaum published an article on a participatory process he had observed, which used Dynamic Facilitation.

The charrette consists of three phases, the pre-charrette, charrette  workshop  and post-charrette stages. A charrette can be used with groups of varying sizes, from fifty to more than a thousand, and they can similarly be organized over a times span ranging from a couple of days to several weeks. A charrette can be used to bring together practical ideas, stimulate participants to work together, and facilitate consensus-based decision making. It is most suited for issues at the local level and is most commonly deployed in cases of participatory planning and design.  Origins and DevelopmentKnow how and why this method was developed? Help uscomplete this section! Participant Recruitment and Selection  Besides the organizers of the project, a charrette requires two groups of participants: a smaller steering committee of around 9- 15 members and a much larger charrette team. The steering committee is involved in all three phases, while the charrette team participates in the second (workshop) stage.  The steering committee should consist of people with diverging backgrounds and opinions/ideologies regarding the issue at hand. Meanwhile they should already be actively interested in the subject, and preferably have some type of expert knowledge. The steering committee coordinates the charrette activities (drafting a schedule, searching for financial support, supporting the workshop).  The charrette team is drawn from the affected community, and is supposed to be representative of the wider population. Although some are near universal (age, gender), the characteristics on the basis of which representativeness is determined can differ depending on the issue at hand.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  A charrette consists of three phases. In the pre-charrette stage, the steering committee prepares the logistics for the following two phases, defines the focus of the project, and drafts a preliminary list of subjects which will be discussed. During the charrette workshop itself, participants discuss with each other and with other stakeholders and create priority lists and recommendations and set out a strategy to implement specific projects. The post-charrette phase creates a final document based on these outcomes, containing an overview of action points.  Several things need to be realized by the steering committee in the pre-charrette stage: the subject or problem needs to be defined and limited, to avoid excessive open-endedness; participants for the charrette team need to be selected; stakeholders identified; information gathered on the current situation; and last but not least logistics need to be taken care of.  The workshop stage consists of several parts, although the organizers can of course set it up in many different ways. In this stage, the largest group of participants is central. After everyone has been given the information gathered by the steering committee in the previous phase, they are divided into smaller subgroups. These have the opportunity to interview experts and stakeholders. Afterwards, they determine the most important elements of the issue at hand. They discuss their findings centrally, and then try to expand further on this again in separate, smaller groups. This can repeat itself many times, depending on the need. This process should be guided to ensure that the deliberations become increasingly more focused every time, until the participants are ready to start working on proposals and solutions. At that point, the group should be subdivided into working groups which each deal with a single element/ sub-problem of the larger issue. Every group should have at least one expert specialized in the specific area with which they deal. Again, formulating and elaborating plans/ proposals/ solutions in smaller groups and deliberating about them in the larger plenary can repeat after each other as often as needed.  In the post-charrette phase, then, the results of the charrette workshop are processed. This should take the form of a final document, which is ideally written in an accessible way, and summarized in a media-friendly format for the local news. One more meeting can then be organized some time later, which is supposed to be open for all. In it, the outcome of the charrette is presented in a forward-looking manner – focusing on implementation – and everyone has the opportunity to comment on the results and procedure.  Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsKnow what outcomes and effects this method typically has? Help uscomplete this section! Analysis and Lessons Learned  Preparing a charrette takes a lot of time, and given the reliance of the method on going back and forth between plenary and focused discussions, a lot of time also needs to be reserved for the workshop itself (at least a few days). Material costs lie mostly in finding a good and large enough location, supplying the participants with anything they need (and probably a small reimbursement for their costs and time). The disadvantage of this method is the large amount of time it requires, which can make it difficult to find enough participants and means that it will probably be necessary to reimburse them for their time.

You can help Participedia by adding to it.Problems and Purpose 
 In 2005, Stephen Coleman called 'Direct Representation', ""an ongoing conversation... something that speaks to (citizens) emotional needs to be respected and treated as equals... in which representatives listen to and acknowledge the authority of the people they represent, and account openly for their own beliefs and actions."" His general form of direct representation has five features: public consultation (effective), two-way conversation (skilfully facilitated), ongoing attention (between elections), honesty (acknowledgement where wrong), and accountability (representatives explaining themselves). 
 Coleman notes that the, ""dominant approaches to representation: first... pits direct democracy against representative democracy; and, second... sees representation as mimetic representativeness... a system that scores high on qualities of formal representativeness might, nevertheless, fail to represent, precisely because citizens and politicians fail to connect."" He concludes, ""Citizens don’t want to go through the time-consuming process of examining and voting upon every area of policy and piece of new legislation. They do not expect every decision to go their way, nor that politicians will perform miracles. They do expect, however, ordinary levels of competence and efficiency, and to be engaged in the political conversation as equals. And they want to know that their contribution will be valued – that it will make a difference... the challenge for democratic politicians is to be seen as ordinary enough to be representative, while extraordinary enough to be representatives."" 
 This method seeks to offer elected representatives (or political activists where representatives will not do it for themselves) a way to supplement the existing system, by informally hybridising it with aspects of direct democracy, i.e. it can be done now without awaiting system changes. 
 The minimal form elaborated here offers representatives a minimum set of actions which could be taken by, or on behalf of (not least unwillingly), an elected representative. The parenthetic suffix (Coleman) should enable differentiation from any other meaning of the term 'Direct Representation', not least  Dave Robinson's proposed voting system . 
 Direct Representation is comparable to  Public Hearings  . A related online version is the  Electoral District Forum  . 
 Origins and Development 
 After returning to live in the UK in 2009 from 14 years away, the author of this entry was exploring how to apply experience gained in Asia around participatory development, to British local politics. Unable to source advice on how to pragmatically bridge the representative-direct democracy divide, he developed and in early July 2013 began to implement, the method described below experimentally, whilst a local activist in the membership of a mainstream political party. Continuing to seek theoretical underpinnings or criticisms to such a venture, he stumbled onto Coleman's work in late July 2013. This offered useful background and reasoning, although it did not detail the exact process proposed here. 
 Useful additional links discovered since include Mark Warren's 2009 paper about democratic deficits. He notes, ""The second kind of deficit calls for what I shall call the ‘retrofitting’ existing institutions: designing new forms of democracy which supplement and complement the formal institutions of electoral democracy, primarily in those functional policy areas where electoral institutions now have weak capacities to generate democratic legitimacy."" The retrofit he recommends, he calls 'Supplementary Democracy' noting, ""We have more questions than answers,"" about appropriate processes, ""but we should get started."" 
 Martin Karlsson has also offered useful insights in a paper dated 2010. Termed 'Interactive Democracy' (itself rooted in Leif Lewin's theorising in 1970), he defines it as, ""the practice among political representatives to interact in a responsive fashion with their voters, potential voters, or constituents regarding issues related to the relationship of representation."" He does however restrain his model, ""to regard only communication, and not, for example, the sharing of decision competences with citizens"". 
 Edmund Burke in 1774 offered perhaps the earliest, clear apology for representative democracy in the face of direct democracy (what he terms, ""the coercive authority of... instructions""). His arguments have been much debated since, and this method is essentially incompatible with Burke's conclusions. 
 Participant Recruitment and Selection Participants are drawn from the population of residents in a particular political constituency. 
 An elected constituency representative (or activist in their lieu) will attempt to contact all constituents. 
 Mechanisms should exist both to periodically purge the list of those who move out, and to add new constituents who move in or have never yet responded. 
 The representative will offer membership of a non-partisan voting panel of constituency residents. How it Works: Process, Interaction and Decision-Making 
 This minimalist method recognises that representatives (and political activists) may for a range of reasons feel unable yet to develop extensively participatory approaches to democracy within their constituency. But it allows representatives to take a significant step in that direction: A topic is selected with sufficient notice which is scheduled for a forthcoming, openly notified, publicly accessible, municipal vote involving the relevant representative. 
 The representative (or activist) digests the issue and constructs a relatively simple polling question on the subject, involving equivalent options to those they will have at the vote (generally yes/no/abstain). 
 The representative (or activist) circulates the question to all members of the panel (along with links to publicly available agenda-related documents for those with an internet connection), giving them an efficient but simple mechanism for voting on which way the representative should themself vote, and a reasonable deadline for responding. 
 If necessary, an activist will collate and forward a summary; the representative should consider the proportion of votes offered for each option (or not replying) before deciding how they will vote themself on the issue. 
 The representative votes, preferably transparently (sometimes municipal votes are nodded through in council if no request is made to put the issue to a vote). 
 The representative (or an activist) feeds back to all panellists, and preferably also all constituents, how the representative voted. 
 The representative should account (or be invited to do so by the activist) to all  panellists, and preferably also all constituents, about the way they voted. 
 Constituent responses need to be managed, including 'unsubscribe' requests, broken email links, and wrong phone numbers, in preparation for the next cycle. Influence, Outcomes, and Effects Where an activist rather than the elected representative uses this method, it should aid the conscientization of constituents and their representative to their representative's (and municipality's) consultative democratic deficit. 
 Making use of such a panel part of an election candidate's personal manifesto in a conscientized constituency may increase the likelihood of their election, both through increased turnout by otherwise disaffected voters, and by allegiance switching by more regular voters. 
 By involving more socially excluded (including unregistered) constituents in the panel, not least by offering alternative forms of contact than the internet, systemic inequities can be partly addressed. 
 Where an advisory sub-group of panellists can assist with selecting issues and drafting questions, partisanship can be reduced (and be seen to be) despite the political affiliation of the representative/ activist managing the panel. 
 A representative should have a less tentative and more objective appreciation of the polarity and strength of feeling amongst constituents on the issue up for a vote, and be better able to test the viability and reasonableness of their personal opinion; they are likely to make a more valid choice themselves. 
 Representatives may even become  de facto  proxies without the formal institution of direct democracy (a positive feature of this method for those keen to see more direct democracy but not wanting to await the end of structural resistance to it). 
 Representatives are likely to clarify their own ethical boundaries, more often distinguishing them from political ones, with the potential to reduce partisanship. 
 A representative will have a better opportunity to engage in a conversation with constituents. 
 A representative will have a better opportunity to demonstrate their accountability to constituents. 
 A representative may well converse authentically with constituents far more than previously, not least given the need to start, maximise and sustain the panel, to everyone's greater satisfaction. 
 A representative may well influence similar developments amongst colleagues, and influence municipal systems, both processes enabling an increase in authentic participation across the municipality. 
 A representative may well be stimulated to progress from the limited form of direct representation to Coleman's proposed more general form. 
 Inevitably, expectations will be raised through beginning this process. If such expectations are broken, prior voter cynicism is likely to be more deeply entrenched. Analysis and Lessons Learned Note: the following analysis represents the views and experience of the author of this entry, Ditch Townsend, who also developed this method.Observors, critics, and sometimes panellists will often interpret the polling as a sample survey, and offer a critique of the supposed survey methodology. But it can be too obvious to grasp that: firstly this panel is the  population  of constituents willing to interact; it is  not  a  sample , 
 and secondly, polling is a (non-binding) proxy  vote ,  not  a  survey . Were it a sample survey, it could indeed be criticised. But it is not designed to merely inform a representative prior to a vote, or it would ask a nuanced range of questions, preferably also with a qualitative component. It is a very specific aggregated proxy vote who's outcome the representative can choose to adopt or not. For several months from September 2010, the author piloted a doorstep random sample-survey approach to gauging constituency views about the way their representative should vote. For a constituency of several thousand voters, a desired yes/no response ratio of at least 60/40, an acceptable margin of error of 10%, and a confidence level of 95%, the sample size calculation was around 90. For a short-notice poll, this proved logistically very difficult to achieve, suggesting it would be ultimately unsustainable. 
 Debriefing the outcome with colleagues indicated an intuitive disbelief that a sample size of 90 could be representative, despite its statistical  bona fides  (likely also therefore to feed the politician-mistrusting view of the average constituent). There was already an ambivalence about random sampling - purposive sampling would have been considered indistinguishable from biased sampling, probably undermining constituency trust. 
 The offer of influence was only made to a small percentage of constituents: to have even a 50/50 chance of one specific constituent being contacted in a year would require an unmanageable number of surveys, and to leave a significant number of constituents with the impression that they were being much more regularly contacted would not only be overwhelming in terms of work load, but would require an improbable number of issues coming up for vote. 
 A seasoned political colleague observed that constituents might feel disappointed - even cheated - if a survey were to bypass them: she noted that people would at least want to know in the aftermath of a vote that they had chosen not to respond, or been unavailable, or they might react disproportionately negatively. They would not want to know that the 'average' constituent's view had been considered by their representative, but that their own view had been, even if it had not prevailed. 
 The surveys did not add the complicating third option of abstaining, but even if it had, it could not account for strength of feeling without adding a supplementary question - complicating the analysis. 
 Political canvassers are familiar with, and already have systems for, visiting and providing printed information to every household. Constructing and maintaining a constituency-wide panel should not add significantly to, or disrupt, the work of the more committed local politician, and will be more sustainable than random survey sampling. Voting instead of surveying, and approaching the whole poll population instead of a sample, mean that non-response rates approximate the degree of importance of the issue to the polity, not the poll's representativeness (like comparing voting rates in local and national elections for non-compulsory voting jurisdictions). Whole-population voting is likely to be intuitively a more authentically personal communication than sample surveying in the eyes of constituents; as such it could also increase appreciation of subsequent feedback about the impact of 'my' response (even if it was a deliberate non-response). Limited direct representation had not (until at least 2014) been practised from the position of an elected representative; only that of a mainstream opposition political activist in a local authority first-past-the-post voting system. Lack of incumbency (let alone lack of experience) could reduce an activist's apparent relevance. 
 Setting up a panel could be seen as merely a short term and partisan political tactic; it certainly introduces an extra barrier for the incumbent representative(s) facing such an activist's activities in their constituency, to such a scheme's implicit acceptability. 
 Constituency conscientization may possibly be aided by the apparent resistance of incumbents (representing the  status quo ), but it may simultaneously politicise the concept of participation and entrench vested interests. 
 Getting a political representative to be involuntarily accountable for their actions may be considered hostile, and at the very least will need careful management. No experience-based advice can be offered to incumbent representatives about the viability of introducing such a mechanism to their polity, but it is likely to be much more painless than doing so as an activist against ambivalent incumbents. Accusations can (and probably will) easily arise about bias in recruitment of panellists, the selection of voting topics, question phrasing, and feedback. Early attempts to add panel members suggested that the political roots of the recruiter should be explicit (emphasised whilst speaking) not merely implied (for example with a badge), but the non-partisan nature of the panel should also be clear (for example, by not canvassing for political support on the same visit). 
 A standing offer should be made and repeated to panellists to offer themselves (transparently) to assist with question selection and wording. 
 Questions should not appear to persistently hound one particular political party, although even extremely contentious issues coming to a vote can usefully be put to a panel. 
 Guiding people to relevant agenda items and supporting documents needs to be sufficient yet not overwhelming; specific yet not selective. 
 Where agendas and upcoming votes are only available at short notice, it can be hard to satisfy any stakeholder in the process, but representatives should not be prioritised (so long as they can receive the polling summary before the vote) since they already have personal voting power (and accountability), may well have access to advance knowledge of upcoming agenda items, and in a pre-vote debate should anyway be logically open to last moment persuasion (this is not the place to critique 'whipped' votes!) 
 Neither sharing management of the panel with opposing politicians, nor placing it into constituency trusteeship had been attempted up until 2014. 
 The proportion of non-responders should be given in feedback to avoid misinterpreting the balance of support (e.g. 81 'Yes' / 19 'No' has a significantly different import if supplemented by 400 'Non-response'). Such a panel can appear to be a very disruptive political tool, not least where it is not merely tactical but actually empowering local communities. Resistance taking the form of spoiling or disparaging are real possibilities. Such a panel can only serve a limited purpose - it is not a comprehensive participatory democracy methodology. Early panellist recruitment suggested that an offer of contact, ""10-12 times per year - maximum,"" balanced palatability with joining rates, but an offer to choose a preferred contact frequency in the face of possible unlimited involvement appeared to actually reduce the overall joining rate. 
 If any panellists are recruited well before the first question is eventually asked, they may not recall the original contact and the first question may then appear to be unsolicited and even intrusive. It is worthwhile contacting all panellists with a welcome to the panel and a reminder of its purpose and activities within two months, if they do not receive their first question by then. 
 Without the more comprehensive participatory approach (Coleman's general direct representation), using the panel for  ad hoc  polling disconnected from transparent municipal votes (and associated public documentation) may be seen as partisan. 
 Every enquiry stimulated by the polling should be responded to as an opportunity to build authentic constituent conversations. On any particular issue, there is no reason a representative cannot try to persuade panellists of their own views prior to a panellists poll, even where the representative is clear that they will choose to abide by the majority position. This is not a formal proxy voting system after all, and representatives are entitled to disregard the majority opinion of their constituents. The key is to make this an opportunity for honest and transparent constituency conversation and increased two-way influence.

It is applicable to and useful for any group of people who want to accomplish something together. The ""socios"" in sociocracy are the ""colleagues"" or ""companions"", i.e. people with a social relationship and some identified common aims.Values of sociocracyEquivalence – individuals function as peers in deciding how to accomplish their collective aims.  Effectiveness – focus on policies and actions that accomplish collective aims; continual self-­improvement; designing for action.  Transparency – direct access to all policy documents and records relating to one's work. No secrets! This supports equivalence, effectiveness and responsibilities of co-­leadership.Origins and Development  The name  sociocracy  was coined by August Comte, an early nineteenth century French philosopher and founder of the science of sociology. Sociocracy literally means rule by the “socios,” people who have a social relationship with each other. In contrast, democracy means rule by the “demos,” the general mass of people who have little in common. Comte proposed a system of thought and organization known as positivism that he hoped would provide the basis for a stable society and personal fulfillment in the context of the then emerging industrial revolution. However, Comte was not able to suggest a practical structure for his ideas about sociocracy.  Later in the 1800s, John Stuart Mill advocated worker cooperatives in which the workers controlled all equity and selected their own management, beginning the co-op movement that has had some limited success. In the 1920s, pioneering management scientist Mary Parker Follett noted that in the most productive companies, workers strongly identified with the organization as “their” company, allowing them to focus without conflicting feelings on the work of the company and how to make it run effectively. She discerned, however, that no structure existed which allowed such identification to be founded on anything other than a difficult to maintain illusion. It remained for work later in the 20th century by systems scientists, most notably Wiener, Nash, (featured in the movie A Beautiful Mind), and Prigogine (who won a Nobel prize for his work on self-organization), to lay the intellectual foundation for such a structure, the structure offered by sociocracy.  Prior to the development of sociocracy’s practical structure, cultivating an environment that consistently maximizes the potential of an investor-manager-worker partnership has, in general, remained in the hands of a few gifted managers. Sociocracy takes that sort of partnership out of the realm of such ""genius heroes"" and into the hands of ordinary people.  Gerard Endenburg developed the foundations for the logical structures and processes of contemporary sociocracy, using his family's business in the Netherlands as his laboratory. He was inspired by experiments by Kees Boeke, a Dutch educational reformer and management scientist, whose school he attended as a boy, as well as by his training as an engineer at a time when systems theory and cybernetics were new and exciting fields of theory and practice.  In practical operation for more than thirty-five years, sociocracy has progressed past the experimental stage and is successfully serving a variety of organizations worldwide, as diverse as an electrical contracting company, a specialty plastics manufacturing company, a municipal police department, a Buddhist monastery, a nursing home, a chain of hairdressing shops, a local public school system, an international membership organization, a school of media and design, and numerous others.  Participant Recruitment and SelectionKnow how participants are recruited for this method? Help uscomplete this section!How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  In practice, sociocracy would contain three elements:Consent  - policy decisions are made by consent, which exists when there are no remaining objections to a proposed policy decision. Objections must be relevant to the collective aims, and must be explained so that all affected understand them, even if some disagree with the objection. An objection is not a veto or a block; it is a valid reason why a particular decision will prevent a member of the group from doing their job or supporting group aims. Objections are solicited because they provide valuable information. The reasoning behind them allows the group to improve the proposal so all members of the group can work toward their aims more effectively.Circles  - a circle is a semi-­autonomous and self-­organizing unit that has its own domain and aim. It makes policy decisions within its domain; delegates leading, doing and measuring functions to its own members; maintains its own memory system; and plans its own development (learning, adapting, improving). Circles correspond to working groups in various types of organizations: departments, divisions, teams, committees, associations, etc. Each circle has its own aim(s) and steers its own work by performing functions of leading, doing, and measuring for itself. Together the lead­-do­-measure functions establish a feedback loop, making the circle self­-regulating and self­-correcting. The domains and aims of different circles within an organization range from broad and general to specific and focused.Double-­linking (feedback)  - a double link between one circle and another is formed by two people who are full members of both circles. For a given circle, one link is a circle member elected to be a link to the next more general circle. The other link is the operational leader of the circle, who is elected by the next more general circle. There can be more than two links. Double­-linking ensures that information moves in both directions between circles and increases the integrity of information transfer. Through double links, feedback travels up, down and across the circles within an organization.  Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsKnow what outcomes and effects this method typically has?

 A new tool for evaluating the efficiency of participation, the Effective Number of Issues (ENI) makes a precise measurement of the flow of information from participants to sponsors. This technique permits direct and rigorous comparison of the efficiency of different participation methods, and of the same method in different contexts. Instructions for doing the (quite straightforward) calculations are given. 
 ENI is intended to lay the foundation for rigorous comparison of the efficiency of different participation methods by using the data itself. This has not been possible before. 
 Origins and Development 
 Based on 40+ years’ experience of participation and community engagement. Key ideas are drawn from well-established principles in theoretical ecology and communication theory and so have a sound intellectual pedigree. 
 How it Works 
 The new method, the Effective Number of Issues (ENI) appears to be applicable to any form of participation where there is a flow of information from participants to sponsor. It permits direct comparison of the efficiency of different participation methods. It can therefore be used for data-driven research into the factors that make for success (in the sense of greater efficiency) in participation. 
 Around the world citizens are invited to participate in decisions about all sorts of things. What kind of digital future do we want? How do we spend our leisure time? Where should new homes be built? How much local tax are we prepared to pay? What should future provision for the Arts be like? Where should a new waste incinerator be located? Of course it’s not only towns and cities who want information from us; it’s health providers, transport undertakings, central governments and a lot more besides. 
 One thing is certain: there is a lot of participation going on, using different processes to get our views as citizens, service users or consumers. There are traditional questionnaire surveys, focus groups, e-participation exercises, citizens’ juries, deliberative conferences, world cafés, town hall meetings – the list goes on and on. 
 Wouldn’t it be good if we knew how efficient these different processes were, and how well they perform their common task of communicating our views as citizens? And what if we could compare the efficiency of all these different processes in different circumstances? That would be great, wouldn’t it? 
 I have developed a precise measure of the efficiency of consultation, participation and engagement processes which will enable us to do just that. Drawing on established ideas from ecology and communications theory, the key proposition is that the efficiency of a participation should be assessed in terms of the information flow it generates. 
 I have created a new tool for measuring this information flow. It is called the Effective Number of Issues (ENI) and adapts a technique ecologists use to measure the biodiversity of a community of plants or animals. If we think of the information flow as giving rise to a community of issues we can use the ENI to calculate the diversity of this community and thus the efficiency of the process. 
 To calculate the ENI you need a list of all the different issues that are used in, or emerge from, the participation process, and a count of the number of times each one appears. You also need the ENI formula, which is ENI = exp (H’), where H ́= - ∑px ln (px). In this formula ‘p’ is the relative frequency of each issue and ‘ln’ is the natural logarithm. The calculations are quite straightforward using Excel and there is a step by step guide to the procedure here:  http://bit.do/calculateENI . 
 Armed with the ENI we can now rate the efficiency of different participation processes, and explore what makes one process more efficient than another. As a start, Alfred Taudes, Hannes Leo and I have used the new tool to measure the efficiency of the idea generation stage of the Vienna Digital Agenda e-participation. (You can read more about this in the paper by May, Leo and Taudes). The ENI for this process (145.9) is the highest ever recorded. Unless, of course, you know of a participation process that can challenge Vienna for the top position? Do tell us!

 The ENI is still very much a work in progress, and readers of this Participedia entry are invited to submit ENI analyses of their own data – it is quite straightforward! Instructions for doing the analysis are at  http://bit.do/calculateENI . If you prefer, send the data to me and I will do the analysis for you. All that is needed is the frequency distribution of the issues raised in the participation, i.e. what did people talk about/comment on, and how many times did each issue arise?

 Agora Ekklesia group decision-making method defined by the following key elements in an assembly format: Support for fundamental human needs, non-business exchange, volunteering, social hobbies and group decision-making. 
 Quick surveys on the background of face to face deliberative event. 
 Private discussion, no official public discussion. 
 Option of a secret ballot and other voting methods for proposals that have enough support in surveys. 
 Publishing accepted proposals on common website licensed as creative commons and free software with open source code. Max-Neef (1991) classifies the fundamental human needs as freedom, participation, creation, leisure, understanding, identity, protection, subsistence, affection  [1] . Agora Ekklesia is a decision making process designed to fulfil those needs for participants in an assembly setting. The aim is to retain focus on these fundamental needs rather than other challenges that arise in political decision-making such as scalability, the digital divide, media influence or non-participation. Freedom  is realized through minimizing chances for any kind of oppression and remaining friendly, economic and transparent.  Participation  is achieved through sharing of opinions in a private discussion, including taboo and storytelling.  Creation  is satisfied through iterative brainstorming processes.  Leisure  is supported by providing comfortable settings, games and number of activities that can be organized in or by the assembly.  Understanding  is enhancing through keeping discussion private, where there may be less pressure for rhetorics and oversimplification.  Identity  may be supported by working together as an assembly.  Protection  is provided as assembly and its projects support creation of social ties, that are helpful in case of misfortune.  Subsistence  is not the main focus of the assembly, but it may be supported in some projects, for example projects like community gardening may provide subsistence for some.  Affection , whilst not a central focus, may be supported through interaction between participants, and with organisers, during the assembly. 
 Despite having clear aims in supporting the above fundamental needs, it is not clear from the information available how the process is actually designed and implemented to support these needs. 
 Origins and Development 
 Agora Ekklesia was trialled in Hradec Králové, a small village in the Czech Republic in approximately 2016. It is not clear what the overall aim of the trial was. The designer of the process, Michal Štěpánek, noted that timing and execution of the event were poor. The assembly was organized by a newcomer to the village who was not trained in facilitation and did not have a favourable reputation in the community. There is very little information and no official reports of the event available at this time so it is difficult to corroborate what happened exactly. 
 During the first event of the trial, seven people including Štěpánek, also including two people who were opposed to the event taking place, apparently connected to the local mayor who did not attend. Nine proposals were submitted for consideration by the assembly, although it is unclear what the proposals related to. Due to low participation and underdeveloped proposals, these were not elaborated any further. 
 No participants attended the second meeting and the third meeting was postponed by Štěpánek to concentrate on  other projects . 
 Participant Recruitment and Selection 
 Participation is open. Agora Ekklesia was trialled in a small Czech village where participation was open to all. However, only seven people attended the first meeting and nobody the second. It is unclear how the organisers recruited participants. 
 How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making 
 Agora Ekklesia appears to follow a stepwise process. At the first meeting, ideas are registered and published to enable spontaenous brainstorming in an informal setting. Ideas are organised into polls which are used to rank proposals and ideas. Approved proposals are then shared with the group at the assembly. 
 Citizens are encouraged to talk in pairs and small groups. For those who are willing to play, social games may be used to establish new pairs or exchange partners. Pairs may talk about the proposals on information boards or their own ideas. Individual citizens may search public websites with accepted proposals from other assemblies and may translate and register them as local proposals. The facilitator plays a minimal role in the assembly. 
 Later meetings are more complex. Ideas are collected in multiple ways such as through a Facebook group or face to face. Proposals are developed in a relative spontaeneous manner, as soon as an idea has significant support. So that a backlog of ideas with low support doesn't build up, these are discarded at an earlier stage. The minimum decision rule is 50% for supporting a proposal, although higher thresholds can be implemented. 
 Opinion polls used to determine support for proposals include a range of possible answers rather than a simple support/reject option, such as 'yes, it is perfect', 'good idea, but make it more detailed' or 'no, I will dissent' and 'no, I will fight it'. Following this, a public vote or secret ballot can be used. A vote is used when the opinion poll shows support for a proposal is nearing the decision threshold. Votes and polls should be carried out in real time and results published online within minutes. 
 The aim is that throughout the iterative process, proposals are improved and refined, abstract ideas become more concrete and develop into detailed plans.

Thus online deliberation can refer to communicative interaction via  social media , in real time chats, in online forums, on blogs or comment sections. In a narrower sense, online deliberation takes the principles of  deliberation  or of deliberative democracy to the digital public sphere. Thus, it refers to online discussion spaces facilitating democratic engagement free from domination among equal participants, which are open to learn from each other, change their opinion and are oriented towards the common good. A process ideally resulting in a consensus.  Several projects currently try to realize online deliberation like  e-Deliberation ,  Deebase ,  ConsiderIt  and others.  Origins and Development  Jürgen Habermas described in his influential book  The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere  (1989, original 1962) how in the 18th and early 19th century a public sphere emerged in European cafés and salons, where people met and informed by newspapers engaged in political discussions oriented towards the common good. This public sphere, however, disappeared as radios and television became the dominant source for information, which confined the consumption of news to private homes.  With the advent of digital communication, however, a new public sphere emerged connecting diverse people to each other and putting them into conversation. Deliberation now seemed possible on the large scale. Digital communication even brought advantages to realize deliberation in comparison with face-to-face interactions. Through online anonymity, identity markers could be hidden, thus creating more equal and inclusive deliberative forums.  While discussions about  cyberdemocracy  in the early 1990s and before imagined a true democracy on the horizon, with democratic participation automatically spreading through online communication, today it is clear that the utopia of online deliberation was not realized. However, digital democratic innovations provide online spaces either sponsored by governments, NGOs and democracy activists that strive to realize the principles of deliberation.  How it Works  Online communication proves to have great effects on governments, the most prominent example being the  Arab Spring , which is also referred to as ""facebook revolution"". Communication via facebook, twitter and other social media was crucial in organizing these upheavals, coordinating demonstrations and interaction between activists. Social media also have an effect on more stable liberal democracies, where political scandals that would usually pass without having substantive effects, now lead to online campaigns and mobilization that lead to politicians stepping down or policies being altered.  However, these mobilizations, which undoubtedly increase political participation vital for democracies, do not directly indicate a deliberative interaction among participants in the narrower sense of the term. Rather, studies have shown that social media are used to disseminate short messages and information but are not the sight of reasoned discursive interaction. On the contrary, social media are quite frequently the sight of personal attacks and defamation of marginalized groups like women and ethnic minorities. The cyberdemocratic ideal that anonymity would lead to more equality is challenged by these observations.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Social media as such only partially and on a rather limited scale fulfill the ideals of online deliberation. They are rather useful for spreading information quickly and mobilizing for engagement, but not for reasoned discussions. Moreover, online anonymity and the distance between interacting individuals proves to lower the barriers for personal insult.  Thus online deliberation can best be facilitated in the realm of democratic innovations, which pay attention to the structural design of democratic interaction. Discussion rules and online facilitation have proven to improve the deliberative surroundings on the internet  See AlsoDeebase ConsiderIt E-Deliberation (TM)   References  Habermas, Jürgen (1989): The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, Cambridge: Polity.

Perhaps the most well-known case is the  2004 British Columbia Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform . In that case, the Assembly was established through legislation and formally mandated to provide a proposal on electoral reform, which was then put to a popular  referendum .[1] Other Assemblies such as the  Citizens' Assembly on Brexit  were independent from government and provided a recommendation with no guarantee of any recommendations being carried through.[2]  Citizens' Assemblies also vary in their exact purpose. The British Columbia Assembly was tasked, by government, with investigating the possibility for electoral reform in the province. Their final recommendation was then put to referendum.[3] The  National Assembly in Iceland  was organised independently and its purpose was to develop community values and priorities following Iceland's collapse in the Global Financial Crisis.[4]  The rationale underpinning a Citizens' Assembly is similar to that of a  Citizens' Jury  and other mini-publics (democratic innovations based on the principles of deliberative democracy): that a group of randomly selected citizens, when given the information, resources and time to deliberate on a given topic, can produce an informed public judgement.[5] Elected politicians may make decisions that favour their own political interests and are subject to pressure and influence from interest and lobby groups. Even if this is not the case, trust in politicians is low and declining. Decisions made a by a cross-section of society that the broader public can identify with may seem more acceptable or even more legitimate.[6]  Origins and Development  Citizens’ Assemblies belong in the category of deliberative mini-public, defined by political scientist Robert Dahl as “an assembly of citizens, demographically representative of the larger population, brought together to learn and deliberate on a topic in order to inform public opinion and decision-making.”[7] While the idea for political decisions to be made through small group deliberations can be traced back to ancient Athenian popular assemblies,[8] mini-publics in their current form have only been in use since the second-half of the 20th Century. The first use of the Citizens’ Assembly model was in 2004 when a group of 161 people were randomly selected to deliberate on an alternative voting system in British Columbia.[9] While the Citizens’ Assembly model, like other mini-publics, embodies the principles of deliberative democracy, it can also be seen as sitting at the interface of deliberative and direct democracy since it is often followed by a referendum or popular vote.[10]  Participant Recruitment and Selection  The members of the Citizens’ Assembly are generally selected to reflect the variety of backgrounds and experience found in the wider population. Organizers typically employ some form of quasi-random selection mechanism like  sortition  to ensure the group is broadly representative of the population. The number of participants in the Assembly varies across cases, ranging from 30-160 people.[11] Citizens’ Assemblies typically involve more people than other mini-publics like Citizens’ Juries, but fewer than other deliberative exercises like  Deliberative Polling .[12] For example, the BC Citizens’ Assembly had 161 members, a 2007  Ontario Citizens’ Assembly  had 107,[13] and the Citizens’ Assembly on Brexit had just 51.[14] In general, no politicians sit on the Assembly although there are exceptions such as the Citizens' Assembly Pilots in the UK where one Assembly included local elected politicians. Officials do, however, often play a key role during the learning or public commenting phase when they are called in for  Q&amp;As  with Assembly members.[15]  The number of participants in the Citizen Assembly process - i.e. those that interact with the Assembly through the learning or public commenting phases - vary greatly depending on the scope of the issue under consideration. The BC Citizens’ Assembly saw close to 400 people give testimony during  public hearings  which were attended by approx. 3000 people.[16] In contrast, the Citizens’ Assembly on Brexit heard presentation from just 10 experts during the learning phase and 2 elected officials during a Q&amp;A before heading into the  deliberation  phase to make their final decisions.[17] Special attempts may be made to hear from hard-to-reach members of the public. The BC Citizens Assembly travelled around the province meeting with people while the 2007 Ontario Citizens’ Assembly held  focus groups  with “people who might not ordinarily feel that they had the skills and resources to participate in public consultations, such as people who are homeless or living on low incomes and people who have only basic literacy or English skills.”[18]  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The following is a general overview of the process; each use of the Citizens' Assembly may vary in timeline and structure as well as the tools and techniques used during the various phases.  Learning Phase  The members of the Citizens’ Assembly are generally selected to reflect the variety of backgrounds and experience found in the wider population. Often participants have varying degrees of knowledge and understanding of the issue, so a Learning Phase is used to prepare members for the tasks and challenges represented by the mandate.  The length of the Learning Phase depends on the complexity of the issue under consideration but can last anywhere from four weeks - as was the case in the  1st sitting of the Irish Citizens’ Assembly [19] - to three months, as was the case in the BC Citizens’ Assembly on Electoral Reform. Learning sessions use a variety of communicative tools and techniques such as expert panels and  Q&amp;A sessions ; ‘interactive lectures’ or presentations; and pre-session reading, audio, or video materials. Following each presentation, the Assembly will typically break into small, facilitated discussion groups which provide members with the opportunity to increase their understanding of the learning materials and the lectures, and to discuss in detail the specifics of the issue at hand. The Learning Phase may also contain a public component such as open forums or written submissions, or these may take up their own phase as discussed below.  The learning phase is also dedicated to teaching Assembly members how to work together, often through the development of a set of “Shared Values”[20] or ‘conversation guidelines’[21] and approved policies to guide their work and the deliberative decision-making processes following the learning phase.  Listening Phase: Public Hearings, Consultations, and Submissions  Following the learning stage, the Citizens’ Assembly process often - but not always[22] - enters a phase of invited and open-comment and discussion.  Public hearings , written or in-person (oral) submissions, and meetings with stakeholder and non-governmental groups ensure the Assembly hears from a broad range of opinions on the issue under consideration. During public hearings, only those invited by organizers are allowed to formally testify; however, hearings can be open to the public and leave time for questions, comments, and discussions with members of the Assembly. Summaries of the formal presentations may be posted to online websites to inform and translate complex issues to members of the public.[23] Meetings with community members[24] or focus groups with hard-to-reach individuals may also be organized.[25]  Deliberation Phase  The  deliberation  phase is key to the Citizens’ Assembly process: facilitated dialogue and debate allows members to critically engage the information received during the learning and listening phases before coming to a shared, workable decision.[26] Deliberations are often a mix of open plenary and small-group work. The 103 member 2007 Ontario Citizens’ Assembly included 48 plenary sessions and just 15 small-group discussions over its six week (12 day) deliberation phase. In contrast, the 51 member Citizens Assembly on Brexit relied almost exclusively on small-group work in  roundtable discussions . In their final report, organizers stated that “[s]ome people are comfortable speaking up in front of a large room full of people, while others are not, so properly inclusive discussion amongst fifty people is hard to achieve without splitting the group in this way.”[27]  Almost all Citizens’ Assemblies include some form of facilitation or moderation, and other tools and techniques may be employed to aid the discussions. A  2018 Citizens’ Assembly on Social Care in the UK , for example, used the following techniques to ensure members were able to engage with the material from the learning phase, and were equally capable of expressing their views and opinions during discussions:""Using small group and individual work to ensure that all participants were able to contribute and have time to reflect and develop their own opinions, particularly those less confident in public speaking;  Using exercises that supported Assembly Members to engage with complex information and feel able to put forward their opinions, with no prior knowledge needed;  Changing the seating plan at the beginning of each day in order to expose Assembly Members to a range of views and prevent dominant narratives developing; and,  Designing the seating plan to, as far as possible, provide a balance of gender, age and attitudes to a big/small state at each table”[28]The deliberation phase of the BC Citizens’ Assembly is characteristic of most deliberations on technical or complex topics: moving from “a discussion of fundamental principles to an examination of the specific issue at hand, including, for example, legal or technical details.”  The final sessions of the deliberation phase are typically dedicated to arriving at a final decision through a careful and systematic comparison of one or more alternatives. Roleplaying or  scenario-workshopping  may be used to allow participants to fully consider the implications of the options. A decision is generally made through voting or consensus and may come in the form of a single recommendation or a set of workable options.[29]  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  In general, Citizens Assemblies bring together a broadly representative group of citizens to deliberate in an informed and facilitated manner on an issue of public relevance. The conclusions or recommendations reached by the Assembly are rarely binding, but are communicated to public officials and the electorate to provoke a more informed consideration of the issue before making a final decision.[30]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Citizens’ Assemblies have the potential to signal real public opinion on policy issues. The Irish Citizens’ Assembly’s ruling on the 8th Amendment to the Constitution (decriminalization of abortion) was thought to be overly-liberal, but was confirmed when the public voted in favour during the referendum. Because the Assembly accurately captured public opinion almost a year before the issue went to popular vote, the method is a valuable way for politicians to gauge public opinion and to proper action before a decision is made.[31] Comparing it to the referendum on Brexit which was not preceded by a Citizens’ Assembly or deliberative consultation, Jack Bridgewater of the University of Kent concludes that  “Serious consultation, via sortitions, would have increased our knowledge of public preferences about the EU. Was this an issue that public wanted a referendum on for example, and if they did want one, what questions would have most accurately captured their preferences? Equally, knowing that there was this system in place beforehand would have placated the fears of politicians and the public, as we would have had a better understanding of our democratic choices, rather than having to project our own individual preferences onto the result.”[32]  Presumably, the same holds for other cases of contentious public policy issues: it is preferable to consult a randomly selected group of individuals through deliberation at least before a referendum is held or an executive decision is made.Online Public Commenting as a form of DeliberationOrganizers of the BC Citizens Assembly observed that, as more submissions were made to the open  online  forum, individuals began to refer to previous posts, creating a running dialogue.[33] While not intended, the BC Citizens’ Assembly thus created another space - albeit online - for dialogue among members of the public on an important yet complex political issue.

It rests on the assumption that qualities necessary for democratic discourses and common decision making do not emerge by themselves but need to be acquired through education. This does not necessarily refer to teaching and learning in the education system but more broadly to life-long learning in various societal institutions like churches, the work place, and neighborhood communities.  While for some acquiring knowledge in form of facts about democratic and governmental processes is the central goal of civic education, others stress acquiring the abilities for critical thinking, questioning what is presented as truth, and for a considered and empathetic interaction with others. Civic education promotes democratic ideals, aims at politicizing and empowering citizens.  Origins and Development  Initiatives for civic education have increased in recent decades as decreasing voter turnout and increasing political disengagement have revealed a need for greater public knowledge and capacity building for democratic decision - something that is not currently provided by most school curricula. While ""elitist"" approaches to democracy argue that common people are inept of taking democratic decisions or participating in an informed and civil discourse, promoters of civic education claim that these abilities can be learnt and that it needs a more fair distribution of educational resources to include the lower income strata of society.  The problem of lacking educational resources for participation are amplified by the way modern media systems function. Since media corporations are in competition with each other and depend on revenue from advertisement their main goal is to entertain, not to inform and educate. Public broadcasting is increasingly undermined by private TV and radio stations. News and educational documentaries are diminished and what is left of it is replaced by “infotainment”: News and documentaries tend to be short, focus on images, and try to emotionalize. While the spread of new media is reason for hope as independent news sources and alternative media emerge, the internet nevertheless is a deeply commercialized space. The use of  social media  tends to decrease the attention span of children (and adults).  Participant Recruitment and SelectionKnow how participants are recruited for this method?

 Raffaele Calabretta, a senior researcher at the Italian National Research Council developed this mechanism to be used by party members in between elections to deliberate, make decisions, and vote. [1][2] The doparie are open to all the supporters of a party, and are centred in providing balanced information and promoting good  deliberation . The doparie are designed to improve the communication between party members and voters, to increase accountability, and to allow parties to consult the base on difficult decisions that split the elected representatives (e.g., end of life laws). 
 Origins and Development 
 In December 2005, the proposal of doparies was first officially presented in the weekly magazine Avvenimenti.[2] In December 2007, the spokesman for the Secretary of the Democratic Party (PD) Roberto Roscani commented as follows: “The proposal of doparies was read with attention and will be considered in the committee that has the task of preparing proposals for the Statute of the PD.” Article 27 of the Statute of the PD—approved on February 16, 2008, and amended by the National Assembly on May 21-22, 2010—provides for procedures similar to doparies (called “internal  referenda ”). 
 In early March 2009, two articles on doparies written by Mario Pirani (2009a, 2009b), one of the most prominent Italian journalists (Pirani, 2010), were published in the most important Italian newspaper, la Repubblica, followed by several other commentary articles in main national newspapers and by national public television interviews (e.g., Calabretta, 2009a, 2009b).[2] 
 At the end of March 2009, the first congress of the right-wing party Il Popolo della Libertà (PDL) approved the statute of the party. Article 10 provides for  electronic consultations  on important decisions. (As already pointed out, doparies have to be preceded by a critical phase of study and debate, in which there is a reasoned exchange of different positions with regard to the subject of the dopary among a limited number of participants.) 
 The proposal of doparies entered into all three motions of primaries’ congress of the PD in October 2009 (in the congress motion Marino, it is written as “primary and dopary party”; Civati, 2009).[2] Close to the primaries of the PD, the media coverage of doparies had an international visibility through Miguel Mora in the Spanish newspaper El Paìs (Mora, 2009).[2] 
 How it Works Know how this tool or technique works in practice? Help us complete this section!Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 In January 2010, the essay titled “Doparie dopo le primarie” (Calabretta, 2010a) was published, and then promoted all over the country.[2] On December 20, 2010, doparies were described in the newspaper la Repubblica as “a system of democratic common sense wisdom” (Ceccarelli, 2010).[2] In February 2011, the new center-right party Futuro e Libertà, born from the splitting of PDL held its constituent assembly and approved the first articles of the Statute, which speak of “peripheral participation in decision-making.” The party leaders have spoken from the stage of a technology platform, connected to the Internet, for members to vote on all decisions of the party (Maurelli, 2011).[2] 
 The widespread implementation of doparies could start from the bottom. On March 5, 2008, a civil list near the center-right at Bitonto, a large town near Bari, in southern Italy, brought the political agenda for administrative doparies (bitonto.myblog.it). On October 25, 2009, the same day when the national primary of the PD was conducted, the party leaders of Luino (Varese) decided to organize a sort of referendum on the decision of the municipal administration to build a wall along the lake. The consultation was open to all citizens and had a great turnout: About 15% more than the people who have voted in the primaries decided to express their opinion in the consultation, despite the requirement to make a double line (Varese news, 2009).[2] 
 In the uncertain situation of Italian politics at the end of 2010 and early 2011, characterized by mistrust from the side of electors to the major Italian parties, the secretaries of the PD of some towns in Sicily (Enna, Caltagirone, and Gela) organized a referendum open to members and electors on the decision of whether the party should continue to support the regional government. The initiative infected the other parties of the center-left wing, which called for a coalition regional consultation on the issue. Subsequently, Senator Enzo Bianco, a former Minister of Interior Affairs, through YouTube, gathered signatures of party members for a deliberative referendum based on Article 36 of the Statute of the Regional PD, which refers to Article 27 of the national statute. Some newspapers and blogs explicitly spoke of “doparies” (Catania Politica, 2011; Condorelli, 2011; Giornale di Sicilia, 2011; L’Opinione, 2011; Pipitone, 2011).[2] A total of 5,000 signatures were then delivered by May 2, 2011: The regional leaders of the party indicated that referendum regulation would be approved in June 2011 and that what should be the first regional dopary would take place after the summer. In a press conference at the Chamber of Deputies, convened on April 14, 2011, to present to the press a new draft law on internal party democracy and discipline of primaries, the former secretary of the PD Walter Veltroni spoke in favor of the internal party referenda and specified that they could be subject to further regulation in political parties (Fraschilla, 2011).[2] 
 During the same period, young national political party leaders such as Giuseppe Civati and Sandro Gozi have publicly expressed on their  Facebook  profiles that they will organize the first national dopary on the theme of the political alliances of the PD, a topic that lacerates the party for years. In his book “Oltre i partiti” (“Beyond the parties”, 2011) the former coordinator of PD Goffredo Bettini has proposed to the center-left to open up to new forms of representation, in which the role of primaries and doparies would be crucial. 
 It has to be verified whether the ordinary accomplishment of doparies in one of the two major Italian parties could have a contagious effect on the other political parties, as seems to be already happening: In March 2011, a consultation on nuclear energy was launched among the party members on the site of right-wing party Futuro e Libertà. In May 2011, Antonio Barile, a former mayor of San Giovanni in Fiore (Calabria, South Italy), committed himself to delivering doparies if reelected as mayor (PDL more civic lists). In Emilia Romagna, two regional leaders of Beppe Grillo’s Five Star Movement have brought their resignation in the face of public confronting a sort of referendum on the work that they carry out the election in the region (Ponzano, 2011). The decision on what should be their salary was also subjected to consultation. Did this participatory policy influence the movement’s local elections in Bologna on May 15, 2011, where the Five Star Movement scored a very good result (nearly 10% of the vote)? On June 24, 2011, Pierluigi Bersani, general secretary of PD, called and chaired the party’s national board focused on internal democracy; during the press conference, he announced that his party would soon organize the first party internal referendum (Collini, 2011). 
 After 2 years since the appearance on Facebook, dopary pages have thousands of friends (of different political affiliations, right and left), in addition to the thousands who have signed the  petitiononline . On March 24, 2011, the proposal of doparies was presented at the library of the Italian Chamber of Deputies by invitation of the PD parliamentary group. It is gaining increased interest in Italy and beginning to be known in other countries: On May 27, 2011, the most widespread nonsports newspaper in Spain El Paìs has published a long article about primaries in Europe (Gomez &amp; Prades, 2011), and doparies are the only new method mentioned.[2] The first vice-president of the European Parliament Gianni Pittella wrote that politics needs to encourage direct participation in public life with doparies (Pittella, 2011).[2] 
 In 2011 Calabretta published the  first scientific paper  about doparie. In the first five months of 2012, he and collaborators (researchers of Harvard Kennedy School of Government and of MIT) conducted the first experiment of online doparia.[3]

 Problems and Purpose 
 While the concept of neighborhood groups advising government has been around for years, no city has incorporated such a system to the degree that Los Angeles has in terms of city structure and funding. The now 96 Neighborhood Councils (NCs) receive a yearly allocation of $37,000 and support from dedicated staff in the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment, the City Attorney’s Office and the City Clerk’s Office. NCs can formally weigh in on issues before the City Council via Community Impact Statements, which are printed on the City Council meeting agendas on whether or not a NC is supportive of an issue. They are the only entity inside and outside the City with that power. 
 Origins and Development 
 In the late 1990’s, Los Angeles was facing a crisis as discontent neighborhoods across the city expressed their displeasure at being under-represented by city government. The most visible sign of alienation was the San Fernando Valley and Harbor areas secession movements. One alternative considered was increasing the fifteen City Council seats. There were concerns that City Council districts, at nearly a quarter-million people each, the largest in the nation, were too large to respond to many of the concerns of individual communities. 
 Rather than increase the existing representative democracy, the framers of the City Charter reform proposed a citywide Neighborhood Council (NC) system that they knew would be an experiment in participatory democracy. As one of the community members involved in the development of the system remembers, “It was damn exciting! We were creating an entirely new way for everyday people to be involved in city government, to change it for the better.” NCs were to be self-governing, independent advisory bodies to the City, and yet part of the City family as well. This presented not only a groundbreaking opportunity, but also an equally daunting challenge: how to cultivate grassroots democracy in one of the county’s most populous, most geographically vast and culturally diverse urban metropolitan centers, with a historically low level of civic participation. 
 Participant Recruitment and Selection Know how participants are recruited for this method? Help us complete this section!  
 How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making 
 NCs have learned to be effective advocates in their community on land use, public safety, utility fees, sustainability issues, such as water conservation, City budget and any other matter affecting their community. In the past several years alone, they have defeated a sales tax increase (on the ballot) and a billion dollar bond for street repair (didn’t make it to the ballot) because the City failed to engage in sufficient community dialogue prior to proposing these matters. Through their alliances, they work with the Department of Water and Power where they negotiated the creation of a new City Rate Payer’s Advocate position to monitor rates; the Planning Department where they influence top City officials on sustainable building and zoning codes; and the Mayor’s Office where the NC Budget Advocates have worked collaboratively on City budget issues every year, including weighing in on union salary negotiations. 
 Influence, Outcomes, and Effects 
 The NCs are significant in redefining how government can effectively interact with its people to increase civic participation in a time when apathy is high. While Los Angeles saw a decrease in voter turnout the last several years, NCs are slowly pushing their numbers up with very little resources from 19,000 in 2012 to nearly 24,000 in 2014. As independent bodies, NCs can be innovative in ways to increase civic participation, such as using Nextdoor.com to increase online interactions with stakeholders, or using instant runoff voting in their elections. In 2016, they will pilot online voting citywide to increase voter turnout. 
 The transferability of the NC system has already been successful. The city of Nagoya, Japan, started their own neighborhood council system in 2010 based on their extensive study of Los Angeles’ system and their Mayor’s desire to increase civic participation in the community. In 2013, the White House Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative program in Memphis, Tennessee, started the Frayser Neighborhood Council using the bylaws and structure of Los Angeles’ NCs in order to address inequitable delivery of city services based on perceived race issues. Within their first year of operation, they were successful in raising awareness to vote down a tax increase in the community. Over fifty countries have come to learn about Los Angeles’ NC system. Many international visitors are stunned and envious of the way the NCs have persuaded city government to share power with them via a common voice created by the Neighborhood Council system.

4307,method,Yanjin Model of Participatory Budgeting,https://participedia.net/method/4307,Yanjin County's unique model of participatory budgeting is a process whereby citizens are given the opportunity to engage in the democratic decision-making process as it relates to allocating resources in their communities.,0,2016-02-03,2021-06-24,110904,"""Scott Fletcher Bowlsby""",https://participedia.net/user/110904,417734,"""Jaskiran Gakhal Participedia Team""",https://participedia.net/user/417734,en,0,facetoface,empower,limited,election,,moderate,public, participantled,,small, medium,,city/town, metropolitan, regional,discussion,,,voting,,,,,make, develop,," Problems and Purpose  Origins and Development  Participant Recruitment and Selection  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The preparation stage before voting on the budget plan encompassed two major segments. First, there was the determination of the total capital appointed to the public  participatory budgeting  plans before the formulation of concrete programs. To be specific, the township government would assess the annual financial resources and subtract basic expenditure as well as rigid spending from it, reaching the sum for public participatory budgets, which would be provided to the people’s councillors before handing-in the programs. Program pools would then be established. The question here was the way to raise the program as well as the proper persons who would be qualified to raise them and who would play crucial roles in deciding the depth of public participation in budgeting. This is exactly where the subtle design of this model lies—both government and peoples’ councillors were entitled to raise the programs but the dominant role was held by the people’s councillors. In principle, each councillor could raise no more than two programs at a time, and he/she should also report widely represented public opinion. Also, the township government could present government-led programs based on the local developmental plans, which could also enter the program pool after a thorough discussion at a government working meeting.  The segment of program review, including qualification review, formality examination, and content checking, also stands out as one of the typical features in the  Yanjin  Model. To be concrete, the working panel in county government would organize or designate experts to investigate the practicality and political permissiveness of the projects, providing a comprehensive review which would be sent to people’s councillors 10 days before the democratic meeting. Only those passing the examination would be presented at the democratic meeting for discussion and voting. It is worth noting that though the government basically dominated the checking process, it is the county government rather than the township government that took the lead role, avoiding the potential disturbance to public participation.  When the democratic meeting is finally held, the public discussion came to empower the peoples’ councillors. The democratic meeting, attended by all the peoples’ councillors without any government officials, was regularly held twice per year, mainly functioning to make annual budget plans and examine the adjustments during the plan implementation. During the meeting, the peoples’ councillors would vote on the proper programs according to their preference after hearing the reasons and presentations on needing funds. To ensure the efficiency and required order for the meeting, a host was selected randomly from the people to preside over the meeting, which is another unique feature of the Yanjian Model.  Besides the former preparation and voting stages, the subsequent implementation and feedback also calls for the public to join in. The peoples’ councillors would supervise the whole process of putting the budget plan into force and if the adjustments are needed, democratic meetings would be held again to vote for approval. Apart from that, the financial department in the county government would organize performance appraisal for the programs in the budget plan, which, together with the call report produced by township government, would be presented to all peoples’ councillors in the democratic meeting next year.

Online voting can be used in representative democratic systems in order to increase voter turnout in local, state or national elections or it can be part of democratic innovations like referendums. Moreover online voting is increasingly used within political organizations. Estonia is the most prominent example of a nation using online voting in parliamentary elections. It was the first country to use online voting in a national election in 2007 and has since incorporated online voting as an optional voting mechanism (besides regular paper ballot voting).  The overall purpose of online voting is to increase political participation. The use in elections in representative democracies aimes at countering democratic fatigue and apathy. Increasing political participation is also the goal of democratic innovations and new participatory mechanisms in political organizations. Liquid democracy is mainly employed within Pirate Parties as a means to democratize party structures and create new horizontal, participatory political organizations. The idea that online voting can increase political participation is also at the heart of many technotopias of the 1990s, which invisioned an inclusive cyberdemocracy through the means of digital referendums.  Origins and Development  Predecessors of online voting can be identified in the use of voting machines, which date back to the late 19th centruy in England and the US. The controversies surrounding online voting today are mirrored in the controversies surrounding this early use of voting machines. In the 1980s developments around the term teledemocracy made voting possible making use of tv sets via teletext. The discussion about electronic voting picked up momentum in the early 1990s through the increasingly popular access to the internet and the rapid development of the world wide web. The USA and Switzerland, relying on their experience in direct democracy, voting machines and postal voting, were among the forerunners of developing online voting. Somewhat surprisingly, Estonia was the first country to employ online voting in national pariamentary elections in 2007.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Online voting platforms are typically open to anyone with an internet connection. Depending on the organizing entity or purpose of the vote, some online platforms may require participants to provide proof of identification to restrict participation to only those eligible to vote.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Online voting – or e-voting (electronic voting) – allows participants to case their vote use information and communications technologies (ICT) which includes the Internet, SMS, or other digital services. Estonia was the first country to use online voting in a national election in 2007 and has since incorporated online voting as an optional voting mechanism alongside regular paper ballot voting.  The concept of  Liquid Democracy  created around the German Pirate Party is an example of a democratic innovation employing online voting. Different online platforms use the principles of Liquid Democracy by giving users the options to collectively write texts in wikis. Online voting is employed to express approval of alternative text versions. Liquid Democracy also makes use of  delegated voting , making votes transferrable to other, trusted people. Delegated voting (or proxy voting, absentee voting), a mechanism originally used to enable those who are unable to physically move to the ballot (because of sickness, old age etc.) to cast their vote through others, is currently expanding due to the possibility of online voting.  Other methods employing online voting are  Wikivote ,  Deebase , and  Electronic Direct Democracy .  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Taking Estonia as an example, there are indicators – however weak – that online voting might indeed have a positive effect on voter turnout, which has steadily increased at each national election from 58% in pre-online voting (2003) to currently 64.2% (2015).  Online voting has faced heavy criticism, however.. Online voting heavily compromises the secret ballot, one of the major priniciples of Western type democracies. If voting processes do not make use of public voting booths but rather take place in private homes, pressure of more dominant household members (mostly men) could be exerted on weaker ones. These worries, however, also affect postal voting. Online voting also opens possibilities for election fraud by governments or other bodies. While developers of online voting systems have generated intricate security systems, none of them can rule out fraud entirely. Once again, this is also true for paper ballot elections. The electronic mediation of elections, however, opens new possibilities for large scale fraud as voting results could theoretically be changed with a few mouse clicks.  One proposed solution to the security of online voting are  end to end auditable voting systems  which make use of encryption technology to enable a voter to verify that their vote has been tallied correctly, whilst ensuring absolute privacy with nobody else able to access their vote.

 DemocracyOS is an open source software which allows citizens to: Propose - Get from zero to democracy in a click. Build proposals and be the change you want to see. 
 Debate - Debate in a platform that rewards the best arguments and filters out unrelated content. Vote  - With a clear deadline, get everyone on board to reach a decision and avoid endless debates. Origins and Development 
 In April 2012, a group of activists, entrepreneurs, students and hackers got together in the city of  Buenos Aires  with a simple question in mind: What is democracy for the internet era? Many modern democracies still run the same way they did almost two centuries ago: citizens only get to interact with the political system once every few years. In an era whereonline  access starts to become commonplace around the world, we are aware of how the internet changed the way we work, communicate and relate with each other. But politics and governments have changed little which is what this tool seeks to address. 
 The first step was to create an open source, free software with an easy user experience for citizens to get informed, debate and vote on every single bill presented in Congress. DemocracyOS evolved to become one of the most used platforms for collaborative decision-making and it got translated into 15 languages. It has been used in Tunisia to debate its national constitution; by the Federal Government of Mexico to develops its open goverment policy; by the youngest parlamentarian in Kenya to consult his constituency, and by the Congress of Buenos Aires, the first experience on digital democracy.

The motiemarkt functions like an open market with council members (or other decision-making individuals) 'shopping' at stalls. If a council member finds an agreeable project, they will sign a form committing them to either adopting the idea into a motion or amendment, or to allocating a portion of the PB pool to the project. The public voting/endorsement process helps to ensure that both council members and citizens commit to the projects implementation.  Origins and Development  The first ‘motion market’ was organized on the 31st of October 2011 and it has since become an annual event in the Netherlands, effectively institutionalized within the budgeting process. The technique has also been employed in Leith during their annual '£eith Decides' PB event.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Participants are generally self selected; citizens and civil society organizations could, individually or in groups, register for the event in order to reserve a table for their project. However, registration remains open until the morning of the event so most are able to participate even at the last minute.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The motion market is usually employed in place of private project submissions. In some PB cycles, councillors will announce a call for funding ideas from the public which are then advertised through community meetings, print media, and online resources. The Motion-Market, on the other hand, allows citizens and civil society groups to present these ideas to the public and convince elected politicians to adopt or fund them. Citizens and civil society organizations presented ideas on the ‘market’, with every group having their own stall. Members of the city council or citizen voters (depending on the allocation of decision-making powers within the PB framework) walk around in a shopping manner, looking at the ideas and talking to their supporters. Every time a match is established between a voter and the initiator(s) of an idea, they sign a form committing them to (in the case of a policy suggestion) signing the idea into a motion or amendment or, (in the case of a funding proposal), allocating a portion of the PB pool. The forms signed at the market when an idea is adopted look very similar to a legal contract, and are supposed to ensure that both council members and citizens commit to further steps.

As in a standard PB process, participants are involved in choosing how funds will be spent. However, they are then also involved in the planning of the proposed project/s.  Origins and Development  Participant Recruitment and Selection  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The process of Participatory Planning (PP) specific to Nepal offers various opportunities for people to participate, interact, deliberate and thereby influence the overall decision making process. Firstly, the local bodies communicate the policy and budget guidelines to the communities via the Ward Committee (supposed to be elected authority but currently are run by the appointed bureaucrats). The community-based organisations, non-governmental organizations and other sectoral institutions such as the sub-health posts, schools, forest user's committees are invited by TLOs, WCFs, Community Mobilizers and alike to deliberate on the guidelines. The deliberation takes place in public places and any of the community member can participate and join the discussions. A local staff of the municipality is also present in these meetings. Experts, activists including the representatives of local political parties and advocates also take part in the process.  Then, the decisions of such deliberations are forwarded to the Ward Committee office which organizes a comprehensive workshop (Ward-Bhela) by inviting the selected representatives of community-based organizations where they justify, argue and defend their initial proposals made at the community level. These workshops are also attended by interested ordinary people, local officials, political representatives and media. Such deliberation can happen from few hours to many days.  Finally, the decisions of Ward-Bhela are then forwarded to the municipal/village secretariat. The municipality then reviews all the proposals. The reviewing process is relatively less open to public however a number of associated institutions such as the Budget Advisory Committee provide extensive feedback onto the proposals. After the revision (mainly from the perspectives of technicality and financial viability), the municipality then organises the meeting of Integrated Planning Formulation Committee (IPFC) which is comprised of all the representatives of communities, NGOs, sectoral organisations and so on. The IPFC deliberates on the refined proposals for many days before recommending the municipal council with the policies to be decided. In absence of elected authorities at the councils, the centrally appointed bureaucrat then endorses the decisions (exactly as is recommended by the IPFC).

Over the last 120 years, leading thinkers from John Dewey to Marian Wright Edelman and Margaret Mead to Paulo Freire have articulated the basic hypothesis that:  ""If living in democratic societies committed to human rights creates well-being, AND if people learn primarily based on the people and environment that surrounds them, AND if culture is transmitted from one generation to another, THEN we need to create environments where people of all ages, especially youth, are immersed in the values, practices, and beliefs of democratic societies and human rights.""

 ""Citizen Budget"" is an innovative online tool to improve public budget consultations. The customizable budget simulator is at the cutting edge of online engagement and educates residents about government services, budget tradeoffs and limits to government spending in a fun, user-friendly and and dynamic way. It can also significantly increase the number of residents engaging in the budget process, providing budget organizers with a wealth of information. 
 Traditionally, governments, schools and other bodies have held public meetings to solicit feedback on their budgets. However, these public meetings have significant limitations: they are costly, attendance is limited or dominated by a few people/groups and there are time restrictions on each person's participation. Citizen Budget moves the process online which can increase citizen engagement by lowering the time needed to participate. The tool is also unique for its simulation exercise which gives users an appreciation for the difficult trade-offs associated with city budgeting. 
 Origins and Development Know how and why this tool/technique was developed? Help us complete this section!  
 How it Works 
 As Citizen Budget is only a tool to facilitate the implementation of participatory budgeting, the recruitment and selection of participants varies from case to case. In Montreal, for example, social media was used to attract visitors to the site. 
 Citizen Budget simulator puts residents in the shoes of public administrators as they manipulate real numbers of the city budget and see the impacts to services and their taxes immediately. Through this 10 minute exercise, residents deepen their appreciation on how municipal services are delivered and learn about the important tradeoffs made by city leaders. The city receives the residents' submissions in aggregate, in a personalized dashboard with data available in an easy-to-use Excel download.There are currently 3 versions of Citizen Budget : The tax version (where residents vote on how their tax dollars are spent) 
 A capital project consultation such as recreation or aquatics center, new park, library, etc. 
 The 'balance-the-budget' version which can be seen on our website demo at  http://demo.citizenbudget.com/Citizen Budget comes fully hosted and maintained, offering organizers their own private dashboard, choice of domain name, and a dedicated page for each person's submission integrated with social media and email to encourage friends and family to participate as well. 
 As the tool is customizeable, its use and the kinds of public interaction it promotes varies depending on the municipality. For example: Plateau Mont-Royal, MontrealThe borough of Plateau Mont-Royal in Montreal used Citizen Budget to consult its residents on its 2012 budget. Of its 100,000 residents, over 6,000 visited the website and 600 submitted full budgets with comments. The online consultation reached more residents than a previous, traditional consultation at 10% of the costs. City of NewmarketThe City of Newmarket launched a Citizen Budget consultation in the summer of 2012 which included a new feature allowing residents to see the impact of their changes on their taxes. By altering city services, the citizens of Newmarket were able to see in real-time, how their property taxes would be affected based on their property's value. Township of LangleyThe Township of Langley launched a Citizen Budget consultation in early 2013 which took advantage of the platform's customizability by matching the user interface to their brand identity. The consultation asked residents to indicate their preferences on a series of budget questions and also answer traditional ""top of mind"" survey questions. 
 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 No outside analysis of the method has been conducted. All outcomes and conclusions contained in this section have been reported by Citizen Budget's developer,  Open North Inc.  
 In the case of Plateau Mont-Royal, the use of Citizen Budget helped the online consultation reach more residents than a previous, traditional consultation at 10% of the costs. Out of 100,000 residents, 4,500 visited the consultation website; 732 residents submitted balanced budgets; and over 25% of traffic generated from social media. 
 Richard Ryan, a Plateau Mont-Royal councillor, put it aptly, ""For me, this type of online consultation is a public education tool that allows citizens to take their place within government... Both citizens and elected officials appreciated the outreach and educational aspects of the web application, to better understand the budget and the difficulties in making decisions to achieve a balanced budget.” With respect to the traditional, offline participatory budgeting process conducted by a previous administration, “It is no longer a question of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars over 3 years in order for a small select group to vote on how to spend 1 or 2 million dollars."" 
 Similar positive outcomes can be seen in Newmarket. Of 80,000 residents, the consultation received over 1,200 visitors and 287 budgets were submitted by residents. Cindy Wacket, Corporate Project Consultant of Strategic Initiatives for the Town of Newmarket stated that ""2012 was Newmarket’s first year employing an on-line budget tool as part of the overall communications plan to engage the community in the annual budget process. The evolution of our survey into an electronic format provided our Council with insight into service levels and tax spending choices, and helped to inform Council when making budget decisions. The on-line tool helped us to increase our response rate, tripling it from the previous year’s budget, and the open-ended feedback was invaluable for planning projects and priorities for the year ahead."" 
 In Langley, participants 55 and over chose lower budgets for annual traffic calming than those 25-54 and 75.5% of residents suggested a change to the Conservation Education program. Deputy Director of Finance for the Township, Karen Sinclair, said that ""I was very impressed with Open North’s responsiveness to our questions the first time through the process. [Open North] showed great initiative in recommending effective wording that helped us put our best foot forward with our community. I look forward to next year and creating a more robust list of survey questions to engage the community more fully. Great value for the amount paid!""

Originating in the 1960s, the method's name, 'Machizukuri', translates to mean town or community building process. A ""machizukuri council [discusses] the context of an urban plan with the aid of professional consultants and put forth their proposal to the city authorities, which carry out the plan taking the proposal into consideration.”[1]  The method is used to build community capacity and encourage cooperation between residents in bettering their own communities. As well, the method creates a channel of communication between the community and the government which encourages active dialogue and engenders accountability between the two parties.  Origins and Development  The method was developed in the 1960s.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Participants are largely self-selected especially during the initial development phase. Often, residents take it upon themselves to form the Machizukuri council and then proceed to encourage other residents to participate.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The essential pillars of Machizukuri are to bond, bridge, and link social capital, or in other words, to create community unity, a multi-social sector network, and to get involved in government decision-making. With such a complicated and involved agenda, the Machizukuri method utilizes several other participatory tools and techniques such as town meetings,  deliberation ,  consensus  building, negotiation, information and opinion sharing, and local leadership.  To get a sense of the method's process, it is useful to examine one instance of its use. In the 1990s, residents of the North District organized the  Rokko Association for New Machizukuri  in response to government plans to redevelop the area after the Kobe earthquake. Informational meetings were organized by the residents to learn more about the redevelopment plans so as to respond with their own, alternative options. The Association collected the opinions of residents regarding both their opposition to the government's plans and their ideas for alternative development.  After this phase, a total of eight Machizukuri Councils were formed to increase community involvement and head-off the local government redevelopment. The eight councils soon came together in the Joint Machizukuri Council which served as a deliberative forum. Common, district-wide issues were identified and, in February of 1997, the addressing of these issues was assigned to five committees.  There was a total of eight Machizukuri Councils that developed in the district and these eight councils developed into the Joint Machizukuri Council, which deliberated issues common to the whole North District. In February of 1997, five committees developed specifically for dealing with common issues and areas needing attention throughout the district. These committees — made up of residents from the area — focused on reconstructing homes, preventing disasters, caring for the live environment, tending to roads and open spaces, and parks.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  While Machizukuris are generally developed in response to a certain event (such as Rokko's redevelopment plans), its effects on community capacity building and residential mobilization can be long lasting. Not only were the Rokko residents successful in their self-led redevelopment but, in May of 1998, the original Machizukuri Council was reorganized into the 'Committee to Organize the Neighborhood Association' which kept each of the five subcommittees intact. A year later, the Rokkomichi Station North District Park Management Group developed to maintain the park they had rehabilitated. Over 4 years, more than 5,000 residents joined the Group and participated in the development and upkeep of local parks.  Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this method?

Citizen initiatives give residents across the EU the direct ability to propose legislation and influence matters that concern the entire continent. Initiatives that garner 1 million signatures across a wide range of Member States are considered for implementation by the  European Commission .  As laid out in the Treaty of Lisbon, the ECI is unique in that it is one of the first methods of transnational participation. In most European countries, citizens’ initiatives already exist at national, regional, and local levels, although they vary significantly in terms of their procedure and scope. The ECI allows citizens to address issues that cut across Member States.  The ECI is not the first participatory innovation in the EU. Before the creation of the ECI, the right to  petition  to the European Parliament was established under previous treaties. Petitions and initiatives differ in several ways. First, petitions have no formal minimum number of signatures, nor do they require a broad base of support across multiple Member States. Second, petitions may be submitted by companies, organizations, and non-citizen residents.  The European Commission believes that the ECI is “widening up the sphere of public debate, allowing citizens to participate more intensively in the democratic life of the Union, through this new ‘participatory democracy’ tool.” [1] It should be noted that, while the EU and EC use the word 'tool' or 'technique' to describe ECI, it is, in the academic field of deliberative and participatory democracy, considered a method since it follows a multi-level procedure including the formation of a citizens' committee. It is comparable to the  Oregon Citizens' Initiative Review .  Origins and Development  The legal basis of the ECI is laid out in the Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force in December 2009 and amends the Maastricht Treaty (1992) and Treaty of Rome (1957). The Treaty of Lisbon reinforces the right of citizens to “participate in the democratic life of the Union” and outlines the details of the ECI.  The first initiatives were registered in early 2012.  In its formative stages, the right to initiative was advocated by the ECI Campaign, a grassroots coalition of democracy proponents and over 120 European NGOs. The group successfully lobbied for the inclusion of the ECI in the draft EU Constitution and Lisbon Treaty. Currently, the campaign monitors the implementation of the ECI, provides guidance to individuals and groups organizing initiatives, and examines how the framework can be ameliorated.  The ECI program is primarily overseen by the European Commission, the executive governing body of the EU. When an ECI is registered, it is the Commission that reviews the proposal and decides whether or not take the matter forward. In other words, a successful initiative with over 1 million signatures is not binding. No EU funding is provided to organizers of an ECI.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  The nature of the ECI means that participation is open to all EU citizens (i.e. nationals of a Member State); non-EU nationals cannot organize a citizens’ initiative, serve as members of a citizens’ committee, or submit a statement of support. To participate in any part of the process, citizens need to be old enough (though not necessarily registered) to vote in European Parliament elections – 18 years of age, except in Austria where the minimum age is 16.  Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) may be members of citizens’ committees but cannot be counted as one of the requisite 7 citizens, meaning that they may not be mentioned on the committee registration form.Participants in the citizens' committees must reside in at least 7 different Member States.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The first stage in the ECI process is the establishment of a citizens’ committee which must include residents from at least 7 Member States. This body, which cannot be run by formal organizations, must be composed of EU citizens old enough to vote. It is this committee that officially provides the wording of the proposed initiative to the Commission. A varying range of tools or techniques of  deliberation  and decision making are most likely employed during this stage.  Once submitted, the European Commission has two months to either register or reject the proposal. Rejection can be for a number of reasons, including the composition of the committee. The proposal can also be rejected where it falls outside the powers of the Commission, “is manifestly abusive, frivolous or vexatious”, or is “manifestly contrary to the values of the Union.”[2] In its original formulation of the ECI, the Commission had suggested that registration should take place after a significant number of signatures have been collected to indicate that there is support for the proposal, but it was recognized that the rejection of an initiative at that point could cause considerable public disquiet.  If a proposal is registered and made public, the organizers have 12 months to collect 1 million signatures, formally called statements of support. Nationals of any Member State can sign a citizens’ initiative provided they are old enough to vote in the European Parliament elections. Statements of support may be collected in paper or online, but they must be registered on specific forms which comply with regulations. There was originally some disagreement between the Commission, Council and Parliament and those contributing to consultation on the ECI as to the minimum number of Member States from which signatures must be drawn. The final regulation states that signatures must come from at least one quarter of EU countries, or 7 out of 27. However, to ensure that the 1 million is reasonably representative – and not just from one or two Member States – the initiative must collect a minimum number of signatories from each of the 7 Member States. This threshold is directly proportional to the population of each Member State, following the proportions used for the number of MEPs (and multiplied by 750). Thus the minimum number of signatories from Malta is 4,500 compared to 74,250 from Germany.  Assuming the organizing committee has been able to collect the requisite number of signatures and fulfilled the relevant national thresholds, national authorities then have three months to verify the signatures from their polity. If verified, the organizing committee is then in a position to formally present the initiative to the Commission. The Commission has three months to respond, during which officials are expected to meet with the organizers to ensure the details of the proposal are understood and arrange a public hearing at the European Parliament. Having examined the proposal, the Commission is required to communicate an explanation of its response to the initiative, detailing the reasons behind its actions and other decisions. However, it is important to note that the Commission is not obliged to propose legislation as a result of an initiative, even if it collects enough signatures. The Commission's decision is not subject to an appeal procedure.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  The first ECI was symbolically registered by the Commission on Europe Day – May 9, 2012. This initiative, named Fraternité 2020 , is a movement by the Young European Citizens’ Convention to enhance European exchange programs (such as Erasmus and the European Voluntary Service) and increase international solidarity. As of July 2012, six other ECIs had been officially registered, including:Stop Vivisection (advocating animal rights and the protection of their welfare in scientific research)Let Me Vote (petitioning for the right of EU citizens living in another Member State to vote in all political elections in their country of residence)One of Us (arguing for the right to life from conception and denouncing the use of human embryos in research)EU Directive on Dairy Cow Welfare (supporting policies to improve the well-being of cows)Right to Water (advocating that access to sufficient and clean drinking water is a human right, and that management of water resources should not be liberalized)Single Communication Tariff Act (lobbying for the end of roaming fees across Europe)Analysis and Lessons Learned  In the official press release welcoming the speed of agreement between the European Parliament and Council on the realization of this new democratic innovation, Maroš Šefčovič, Vice-President for Inter-institutional Relations and Administration, stated: “The ECI will introduce a whole new form of participatory democracy to the EU. It is a major step forward in the democratic life of the Union. It's a concrete example of bringing Europe closer to its citizens. And it will foster a cross border debate about what we are doing in Brussels and thus contribute, we hope, to the development of a real European public space.”[3]  The ECI is explicitly transnational in its ambition, requiring significant support – 1 million signatures – from citizens from across a number of Member States. It is this feature that distinguishes the ECI from the existing European Parliament Petition (EPP), which can be proposed by a single signatory. In addition, the ECI has been described as extremely innovative; it serves as the most direct route for citizens to influence the agenda-setting process at the highest levels of the EU.  The ECI has attracted some legitimate criticism. For one, some critics have decried the amount of personal data that citizens must provide on their statements of support. Signatories need to submit their full name, address, date and place of birth, nationality, and personal identification number (either a passport or identity card number). Regulations exist to ensure that these data are protected and properly used, but there are still respectable concerns about the process, especially with regards to the online collection system.  Just as importantly, many experts and advocates believe that the ECI should be made more citizen-friendly and workable. As opposed to national or regional movements, ECIs are necessarily transnational in scope, so campaigning becomes far more complex. Large geographic distances make it costly and challenging for citizens to meet and plan, let alone gather signatures. Language barriers also complicate the process, especially given that more than 20 official languages are spoken across the EU. Finally, as the ECI Campaign notes, “the absence of a strong common public space makes it almost impossible to make one’s voice heard Europe-wide through the media.”[4]  The ECI Campaign has expressed satisfaction with the present success of the program, but it views the ECI as only the first step towards direct democracy and not as an end in itself. The group has identified some burdensome restrictions which it sought to remove in 2015, when the ECI was to be officially reviewed. These proposed changes include:Simplifying the signature form. Concerns have arisen over privacy concerns and specifically the requirement for signatories to provide personal identification numbers.  Extending the time limit for signature collection from 12 to 18-24 months. The ECI Campaign believes one year is too short for smaller organizations without large budgets to raise awareness about issues that are not well understood by the general public.  Permitting ECIs to propose amendments to EU treaties. Currently, the Commission will not register initiatives which aim to achieve this, although the law on this issue may be open to challenge by the European Court of Justice.See AlsoEuropean Citizens' Initiative  (case entry)Voters Without Borders - European Citizens' Initiative on full political rights for EU citizensReferences  [1] European Citizens' Initiative.

Collaborative design is a broad term that may refer to more specific methods like  collaborative planning , events that follow a collaborative design such as  hackathons , or  approaches to governance  and policymaking.  Many methods of participatory governance only involve citizens in one aspect of the process. For example, officials may consult citizens before designing and implementing a project or citizens may be consulted after a range of alternate designs have been drafted. Collaborative design on the other hand, typically refers to methods that include citizens from the beginning — during the initial drafting process — until the end, sometimes continuing their engagement after the project's finalization.  Origins and DevelopmentKnow how and why this method was developed? Help uscomplete this section!Participant Recruitment and Selection  Participant selection will depend on the kind of design project and the chosen combination of methods and techniques. However, since the method is quite time and resource-intensive, participant selection is usually targeted or drawn from a representative sample. For example, organizers using collaborative design for the redevelopment of an urban area may only select from among those living near to the area or who are directly affected by the construction.  Depending on the specific method or project, collaborative design may involve engaging multiple stakeholders, as in  collaborative planning , or citizens and other actors such as researchers, as in  community-based participatory research .  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The process of collaborative design often follows a set methodology which may also incorporate various tools and techniques of deliberation and decision making. For example,  multi-criteria analysis  or  thematic dialogue tables  may be used during an  Enquiry-by-Design .  Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsKnow what outcomes and effects this method typically has? Help uscomplete this section!Analysis and Lessons Learned  Collaborative methods usually have several positive effects on the participants such as increased trust in government officials, belief in the legitimacy of the design and decision-making process, and a heightened sense of ownership over the finished product.

The  Black Sash  CBM model involves eight key phases, some of which run concurrently. The starting point is setting up partnerships with government and community-based Organisations (CBOs), building the capacity of Community Partners (CPs) to engage in their own local-based monitoring exercises. Relationships are then built with the local government facility and its managers and the next four phases commence: monitoring and data collection; analysing and cleaning data into reports; disseminating reports in the communities for reflection in dialogues where improvement plans are developed and adopted; and advocacy.  Community-Based Monitoring is designed to benefit and involve government service users. The model helps to build constructive, democratic state-society relations between officials and community-based organisations who collaborate with community members on monitoring and future planning to improve the performance of public service centres.  The core of the  Black Sash  CMB model is the formation of partnerships with both community-based organisations (CBOs) and government in order to strengthen the role of civil society in improving service delivery and holding public and private sectors to account. In empowering communities to participate in CBM, Black Sash also promotes active citizenship. CBM seeks to encourage citizens to appraise the quality of services they receive at the government facility level, express their concerns, and engage in dialogues to promote greater community participation in planning, implementation, and monitoring of service delivery.  Origins and Development  The Black Sash method of Community Based Monitoring was developed by Black Sash in partnership with  Making All Voices Count  and with the technical assistance of  Code for South Africa . Black Sash brought over 50 years of experience with community mobilization and empowerment to the model while Making All Voices Count brought expertise in research and the use of new technologies for citizen-government interfacing. Like other forms of community-based monitoring, the Black Sash modelemploys a participatory approach to build the capacities of citizens to partner with government to monitor local service delivery. Community-led processes such as CBM help citizens claim and exercise their human and political rights, and to push for and receive open, transparent, and accountable governance.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Partnership agreements are signed with community-based organisations to conduct monitoring at the selected service sites. Community partners are trained by the Black Sash and Making All Voices Count to conduct on-the-spot surveys of people waiting in queues at various service delivery sites, as well as record their own observations of the process as they go. The surveys collect feedback on and from:Primary health service users (ordinary citizens)  Primary health frontline staff  Local government service facilities  South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) frontline staff  SASSA service point users (ordinary citizens)  SASSA pay-point facility users(ordinary citizens)After the surveys, dialogues are held to develop improvement (action) plans . Dialogue participants do not have to be those who supplied the survey information, but they should be drawn from the same pool of service users by the community partners to ensure they are equally familiar with the service and facilities being surveyed.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The  Black SashCBM  model involves eight key phases. Some of these phases run concurrently. The starting point is the setting up of infrastructural arrangements with government. Black Sash also creates partnerships with Community-Based Organisations (CBOs), building the capacity of these Community Partners (CPs) to engage in their own local-based monitoring exercises. Then they work to build a relationship with the local government facility and its managers. Once this is set up, the model moves into the next four phases of monitoring and data collection, analysing and cleaning data into reports, disseminating reports in the communities for reflection in dialogues where improvement plans are developed and adopted. The final phase is that of advocacy.Phase 1 - Establishing Government RelationshipsSecuring physical access to government departments and their service delivery facilities forms part of the groundwork of the overall monitoring project. Black Sash signed a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME) supporting the CBM project undertaken by Black Sash in selected government departments such as the Department of Health and Local Government (municipalities) and the Department of Social Development.Phase 2 - Selecting Community PartnersIn this phase, Black Sash identifies community-based organisations (CBOs) to participate in the CBM pilot project. The Black Sash regional staff schedule meetings with partners across all nine provinces and outline the project concept, deliverables, timelines, roles and responsibilities. Black Sash takes great care in selecting the correct organisation with which to partner. They select community organisations on the basis of their capacity to engage and implement the project in their respective communities. Selected community organisations are required to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Black Sash. The MoU ensures mutual accountability by specifying the key roles and responsibilities for Black Sash, as well as the roles and responsibilities of the CBOs taking part in the project. The MoU also establishes a normative framework of values and principles underpinning the overall monitoring project.  All monitors are required to sign a Code of Conduct. Each monitor identifies the day(s), within a specified timeframe, when they would monitor selected sites in the communities where they lived or worked. The Code of Conduct details various character and ethical guidelines, such as the importance of honesty, accuracy in reporting, objectivity, confidentiality, and sensitivity to different languages and contexts.Phase 3 - Engaging Local FacilitiesThis step is about building capacity for the local community organisation and supporting them through the local facility engagement. CBOs are trained on the ethics of monitoring so that they would be able to guide respondents through a questionnaire without invalidating the responses.Phase 4 - Monitoring the FacilityMonitoring takes place over a three-month period each year and consists of light-touch  surveys  conducted by trained monitors. Each community organisation endeavours to survey at least 300 respondents per government facility in order to ensure accurate representation. Responses are captured directly onto the system via mobile or desktop tools, or else are transcribed from paper-based forms.Phase 5 - Reporting the FindingsThis step is concerned with the analysis and packaging of the survey results. Each site is analysed and their results presented back to them by means of high-impact posters which are put up at the public facility to give feedback to their service users. In addition, results are also packaged into a hand-out which is then used to plan the public dialogues with.Phase 6 - DialoguesPublic dialogues are a platform for civil society, service users, and management of the monitored government facilities to discuss the findings of the annual monitoring; together, they will develop and adopt an improvement or action plan to address the concerns raised.This is a collaborative platform, facilitated by the community organisations, from which a joint monitoring committee (made up of community stakeholders and facility management and staff) should be established. The committee ensures the implementation of the improvement plan in the public facilities, particularly in areas where government is not delivering.Phase 7 - Engaging in AdvocacyIn this phase, the Black Sash and community organisations attend to the larger issues that emerged out of the survey results and public dialogues. It is often the case that issues raised at a local level need provincial or even national interventions in order to address the systemic concern.Here, Black Sash also encourages other stakeholders with similar interests to engage with government departments to find practical solutions to the service delivery problems and challenges raised in the surveys.Phase 8: Reflection and LearningMore recently, Black Sash has added another phase to the monitoring process. This step includes the writing up of case studies with community partners of the learning experiences. They reflect on the things that have worked well and should be repeated, as well as the challenges and how these should be changed in the following monitoring cycle. Black Sash and its community partners also review the survey tools in order to improve it for the next cycle.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  The NGO Making All Voices Count used the  Black Sash model of CBM in South Africa  to allow citizens to monitor public service provision by collecting data on government facility sites themselves and using door-to-door surveys on personal experience with service delivery. The pilot project was very successful in improving citizens’ awareness of their constitutional rights to receive quality services and strengthening the voice of poor and marginalised communities in monitoring service delivery. The project's use of CBM also helped strengthen the relationship between service beneficiaries, government officials, and participating community-based organisations.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The South African pilot project revealed some key lessons:  Unfamiliarity with technology may be a barrier to a community's adoption of the model. Some participants were not comfortable using the Tablets to capture the data. While technology can allow for much quicker capture, sending and analysis of data, there are challenges in establishing these systems, but especially in using them in communities with limited exposure to technology or resources to cope with glitches. Those seeking to use CBM should consider the establishment of an overall and on-going training programme in technology usage.

From governance systems to architectural drafts, collaborative planning seeks to include as many stakeholders as possible. Numerous facilitation techniques are used to encourage consensus and cooperation.",0,2016-05-16,2020-06-19,112359,"""Tyler Carlson""",https://participedia.net/user/112359,417734,"""Jaskiran Gakhal Participedia Team""",https://participedia.net/user/417734,en,1,facetoface,collaborate,both,,polarized,high,collaborative, planning, deliberative,small, medium,,neighbourhood, city/town, regional,discussion, ask, negotiation,general,,,,,make, make_influence,," Problems and Purpose  According to scholars ThomasGuntonand J.C. Day, collaborative planning is a “civics-based model of planning that delegates responsibility for preparing plans directly to affected stakeholders.”[1]Also known as ‘shared decision-making’ or ‘communicative planning’, this approach focuses on the use of collaborative, consensus-based practices in designing everything from governance systems, to environmental regulation, to physical infrastructure and community sustainability.[2]  Origins and Development  In their paper “The theory and practice of collaborative planning in resource and environmental management”, Day andGuntonrefer to collaborative planning as a “recent approach to public participation,” yet its emergence can be traced back to the 1960s. Seen for decades as the field of technocrats and ‘experts’, planning underwent significant change as policies increasingly came under critique and debate by a diverse range of state and non-state actors. In response, planners opened the process to multiple stakeholders and allowed for the democratic determination of guiding goals and values. The increased focus on participation led to a corollary development and integration of engagement methods such as  workshops , advisory committees, and  public hearings .[3]  According to Patsy Healy, the collaborative approach “offer[ed] a way forward in the design of governance processes for ashared-power world.”[4] The adoption of collaborative planning has become widespread and is thepreferredplanning model for various public works in the United States, Canada, and Australia.[5]  Participant Recruitment and Selection  The kind of recruitment or selection mechanism chosen will depend on several factors including existing policy or governance frameworks, the structure of the process, and the scope of the planning project.Policy and Governance FrameworksPolicy frameworks which mandate and/or guide the use of collaborative planning are common in places like the United States, Canada, and Australia. Typically, these policies systematize and/or institutionalized a government department or public agency’s use of collaborative planning in various scenarios. For example, all Canadian Government departments and agencies “ha[ve] a duty to consult, and where appropriate, accommodate Aboriginal groups when it considers conduct that might adversely impact potential or established Aboriginal or treaty rights.”[6] The mandating policy often provides frameworks or guidelines for the process of collaborative planning. It is important to note that the guidelines may be drawn up or ‘planned’ without significant public participation - instead involving politicians, bureaucrats, and experts - but, once in place, they help ensure citizens and stakeholders are included in future planning decisions. For example, the Duty to Consult has been established through several Supreme Court decisions but it is the Department of Indigenous and Northern Affairs that guide or inform the resulting process of consultation and, where appropriate, collaboration.[7] There are, of course, exceptions to this. The policy framework which mandates and guides the  collaborative planning of land use on HaidaGwaii off the West Coast of British Columbia was itself planned using a collaborative process.[8]In other cases, an Open Standards model may be used.[9]Process DesignAnother factor influencing the choice of participant selection or recruitment method is the design of the collaborative planning process. Policies which mandate the use of collaboration - such as the Duty to Consult in Canada - may contain provisions or instructions for how to proceed. The number and type of parties and individuals involved in each stage of the planning may, therefore, vary. For example, the public may only need to be included during the initial phase of idea generation whileorganisedstakeholders may need to be included in the higher-level decision making processes. The policy or framework may also specify the need for committees or teams and may provide guidelines on their selection and/or composition. Patsy Healy envisions the planning process as moving from strategy making, to discussions and “inclusionary strategic argumentation”, to the development of ‘policy discourse(s)’ and implementation.[10] Each stage of the process requires an assessment of who to include. The pursuance of the ‘all affected parties principle’ is not always feasible so that, as Healy notes, “it will always be the case that 'those present will outnumber those not present'.” The “inclusionary challenge” facing facilitators and/or participants “is to prevent those 'not present' from being 'absent' from the discussion [by] keep[ing] under explicit review the various ways the members of a political community describe both themselves and the others of significance to them as they engage in discussion, [and] maintain[ing] active respect and appreciation for those members who for one reason or another are ‘not present’.”[11]Scope and Scale of ProjectYet another factor influential to the type of recruitment and selection method used is the scope or scale of the planning project. It is not always the case that the larger the project, the more people involved in its planning - at least in every phase or stage. For example, HaidaGwaii’scollaborative land-use planning framework created two major bodies, the Management Council and the Solutions Table, which manage high-level and operational-level resource decisions, respectively. Each body is “comprised of two representatives selected by the Haida and the Province, and one chair chosen cooperatively by both parties.”[12]  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Many collaborative planning initiatives design or make use of formal, procedural frameworks to guide the resolution of complex, multi-stakeholder scenarios. This approach is often applied to planning cases for the purposes of encouraging public participation, and resolving and mediating stakeholder disagreements.  In the case of environmental or resource management,Day andGuntonhighlight the following steps as best practice:  1.PrenegotiationForming a planning team, identifying potential stakeholders, and assessing the conflict and possible resolutions.  Determining stakeholder groups that will participate in the planning process and selecting representatives from each group involved  Establishing formal rules, responsibilities, timelines, and logistics – which may be agreed upon through consultation with stakeholders  Collecting and analyzing information to be presented subsequently at the planning table2. NegotiationDiscerning the interests of stakeholders and the range of planning options; creating subgroups to conduct joint fact finding when information is insufficient  Clarifying and “packaging” options and encouraging negotiation through a central, guiding document; delegating more contentious issues to subgroups so that progress at the main stakeholder table is not hindered  Formalizing a binding agreement between all parties and ensuring ratification of the agreement is completed by all organizations represented at the stakeholder table3.PostnegotiationAccomplishing all approvals needed in order to begin implementing the agreement  Evaluating implementation through a monitoring framework that account for changing and evolving conditions after planning is completedInfluence, Outcomes, and Effects  The most obvious outcome of a collaborative planning effort is a strategy with support from all affected parties. Collaborative planning is pursued precisely for its ability to return the best possible strategy based, as it is, on a diverse knowledge-base. As well, the plans, proposals, strategies (etc.) developed through a collaborative process are also more likely to be accepted and upheld by stakeholders thus minimizing the amount of criticism or disagreement ex-post facto. For example, the British Columbia Public Service Agency maintains that the use of collaborative planning in the case of Child Welfare “often avoids the need for court involvement.”[13] Compounding the acceptance of outcomes is the fact that collaborative planning efforts give agency and voice to stakeholders. Norman Dale, community liaison for the collaborative economic planning of HaidaGwaii, states that, through the process, “the Haida and other communities negotiated the transformation of a primarily top-down and one-time spending version of economic development into a community-controlled model.”[14]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  While the literature notes challenges in evaluating collaborative planning, Day andGunton(2003) suggest four common criteria to measure its effective use, including:The ability to successfully reach agreement  Efficiency in the collaborative process  Stakeholder satisfaction in the planning outcome  Achievement of social capital among stakeholders.For her part, Patsy Healy states that, if a systemic (institutional) process of governance is to meet collaborative planning’s “normative commitment to pluralistic participation”:It shouldrecognisethe range and variety of stakeholders concerned with changes to local and urban region environment, their social networks, the diversity of their cultural points of reference and their systems of meaning, and the complex power relations which may exist within and between them (Part 11).  It should acknowledge that much of the work of governance occurs outside the formal agencies of government and should seek to spread power from government outside the agencies of the state but without creating new bastions of unequal power (Chapter 7).  It should open up opportunities for informal invention and for local initiatives. It should enable and facilitate, encouraging diversity in routines and styles oforganising, rather thanimposingsingle ordering principles on the dynamics of social and economic life. It should cultivate a 'framing' relation rather than a linear connection between policy principles and the flow of action (Chapter 8).  It should foster the inclusion of all members of political communities while acknowledging their cultural diversity, and shouldrecognisethat this involves complex issues of power relations, ways of thinking and ways oforganising(Chapters 2 and 8).  It should be continually and openly accountable, making available to relevant political communities the arguments, the information, the consideration of stakeholders' concerns, the images and metaphors which lie behind decisions, and should include requirements for critical review and challenge (Chapter 8).[15]See AlsoFrom Stream Management to Watershed Governance: The Collaborative Restoration of Vancouver’s Still CreekCollaborative DesignHaida Gwaii Collaborative Land Use PlanningReferences  [1] Thomas Gunton and J.C.

Help uscomplete this section!Participant Recruitment and SelectionKnow how participants are recruited for this method? Help uscomplete this section!How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Three guiding principles of EBM guide its form and application:1. Maintaining Ecological IntegrityEcological Integrity is the abundance and diversity of organisms at all levels, and the ecological patterns, processes, and structural attributes responsible for that biological diversity and for ecosystem resilience.[3] Ecological-based Management recognizes and follows ecological boundaries such as watershed boundaries, and is more effective at maintaining the integrity of an ecosystem than management that follows political (jurisdictional) boundaries. It is also essential that managers move beyond the traditional, hierarchical management structure, and make connections between patterns and processes at all scales within an ecosystem, including site, neighbourhood, ecosystem, and regional scales and species, population, ecosystem, and watershed levels of analysis.2. Managing Uncertainty: Data CollectionData collection involves collection of both social and ecological data to establish the condition of an ecosystem and to implement monitoring.[4] Monitoring involves identifying and using data and indicators of change to characterize ecosystem status and maintenance/improvement of health.  Adaptive Management is a systematic and iterative approach for improving resource management by emphasizing learning from management outcomes.[5] Adaptive management involves testing assumptions and exploring alternatives. Data collection and monitoring can be seen as components of the adaptive management cycle.3. Social Interagency CooperationIn conjunction with the principle of managing through ecological boundaries, governments, non-governmental organizations, and citizens will need to work together to implement components of EBM.

 Contemporaneously, the Constitutional Courts are now taken as the locus of public reason (Dworkin, 2010), now are highlighted as an institutional interlocutor (Mendes, 2009, Bateup, 2006), and sometimes are characterized by its own capacity to deliberate (Ferejohn &amp; Pasquino, 2002, 2004). Particularly, the relief that the contemporary liberalism lends to the argumentative ability of the Courts (Dworkin, 2010), and the correlative idea that law takes its legitimacy from a culture of justification (Sachs, 2009; Woolman &amp; Bishop, 2008), which is part of the founding of genuine democracies (Mendes 2014), repositions the actions of the Courts within a deliberative decision-making chain (Ferenjohn &amp; Pasquino, 2004, Bateup, 2006, Mendes, 2009). On the other hand, it is assumed that the Constitutional Courts are affected by political environment that surrounds (Friedman, 2009) and seek to be responsive in the face of what circulates in the public expanded sphere. 
 The question of the democratic legitimacy of the Courts won, therefore, new contours, linked to their ability to enter into an interinstitutional deliberative dynamic and, also, social-state, besides presenting internal deliberative capacity, benefiting from its peculiar decision condition (Edwards, 2003). In this display, the public hearings - which flourish in the Brazilian constitutional jurisdiction - represent an institutional innovation with the potential to realign the debate about the democratic legitimacy of the Constitutional Courts, by broadening of the inclusion that promotes, from the point of view of the integration of actors, but also of epistemic arguments (Landemore, 2015) that have appeared especially in discussions of moral background. 
 This depends, however, on its ability to promote internal deliberation to the Court, foster inter-institutional dialog (Tulis, 2003; Mendonça &amp; Amaral, 2014; Steiner et al, 2004), and also works as a sort of socio-state interface (Isunza &amp; Hevia, 2006). How come have been practiced by the STF, although they have specific rules for its operation, the APs vary both in relation to its shape, considering the broad freedom that the rapporteur has to define not only who will participate, but also the rules of interaction between exhibitors, as in the face of its possible uses and effects. 
 Origins and Development 
 Since 2007, the STF carried out public hearings about the most diverse themes, both in ADIs and ADPFs, as in RExt. Precisely, between 2007 and 2014, the Supreme Court held 15 (fifteen) public hearings. With the exception of one - which focused on the importation of used tires - all other are partially or fully documented at the portal of the court.4 
 With respect to the overall incidence of public hearings on the constitutional jurisdiction it can be said that the use of this institutional mechanism has been intensifying over the years, not only in the context of constitutional actions - cases in which the STF acts as a constitutional court, exactly - but, also, when it acts as a recourse to the judiciary, although globally it is still a resource of exception. Over the years the use of APs became more frequent: if in the first five years (2007 to 2011) there were 05 (five) APs, in the last two years, have already been conducted 09 (nine), with emphasis on the year of 2013, when they were performed 07 (seven) APs.5 
 The APs in the STF, however, have a punctual character when considering the total of processes that arrive at the STF, and of these, the total that involves the control of constitutionality- be in extraordinary resource seat, or in the judgment of direct actions. It is noted that the AP is an exception, probably mobilized for the resolution of cases considered more complex and controversial by the Court. The issues surrounding the fulfillment of PAs are not only complex from a legal point of view, but profoundly impact the national public agenda. It is enough to mention that at least two APs - Embryonic stem cell research and abortion in the case of anencephaly - have involved the debate around the ""right to life"" that goes beyond the boundaries of constitutional dogmatic and meets the most contemporary speeches (and struggles) of feminism. 
 It is important to mention that even more directly, the STF held a public hearing in the middle of the dispute over the ""Mais Médicos"" - one of the main programs of the federal government in the area of health, during the first term of President Dilma Rousseff. Even in the area of health, two other APs were summoned to directly be discussed aspects of public policy in this field, particularly related with the Health System - SUS. 
 The affirmative racial action, which foresaw the reservation of places in higher public education, did not escape of the considerations of the STF and, once again in this case, an AP was convened. In addition, environmental issues were subject of scrutinity in the scope of constitutional actions that deserved the held of APs: imports of used tires, electromagnetic field, burned, prohibiting the use of asbestos. Finally, AP held within the scope of the constitutional action that deal with the campaign financing system in Brazil, a central aspect of political dispute in the current democratic context. 
 Participant Recruitment and Selection 
 Each time that an AP is convened the court publishes in its website a summary of the rules of participation. There are three methods of participation: (1) as part of the audience without the right to any manifestation; (2) sending suggestions; and (3) as an exhibitor at the hearing, in which case it is required prior registration and approval by the rapporteur. In the first case, the limit for the participation is the local capacity of implementation 6 and the places are occupied by order of arrival, respecting the reservation to the exhibitors and the press. In the second case, it is assumed that any person or entity, regardless of enrollment. In the second case, it is accepted that any person or entity, regardless of registration, forward useful documents to clarify the issues to be debated in the AP, by print or electronic means.7 The third and most important case concerns the exhibitors of the AP, which are indicated by the parties of the process, by bodies and state entities and civil society entities or by interested who require their participation (experts enabled)8 
 Other AP’s characters are outstanding here, considering, particularly the rules of participation of exhibitors. The APs have a face-to-face character, that is, can not be held by the internet and allow an exchange of documents quite limited, favoring the oral manifestation of the participants, with the aim of promoting a debate around the controversy issue. In addition, although it is possible the participation of individual actors - especially as spectators - favors the participation of collective character. 
 More than 400 exhibitors have already participated in APs in the STF. Exhibitors can be classified according to the origin of their indication: (1) state agents, indicated by one of the three powers of the Republic, or the representative of the Public Prosecutor, or (2) civil society, representatives of professional associations, class entities, medical societies, social movements, fronts, public policy councils, associations of types and forms of varied organization aimed at mutual aid and defense of causes, or, even, (3) specialists who do not present themselves as ""speaking on behalf of"" or exposing an official position of the institutions and entities which were part, sustaining the participation in expertise accumulated by the exhibitor, either as a student or researcher of the subject debated, or as an occupant of positions in important institutions in the area. 
 The number of exhibitors by AP varies greatly, but there is a greater participation, in quantitative terms, of exhibitors indicated by associations or groups of civil society: the social organizations represent 37% of the total of participants, followed by experts, which correspond, to 30%. Among the state agents, those appointed by the Executive Branch were the most present, being absent only from the first AP, held in 2007. Representatives of the Legislative Power were present in 10 APs, being come, mostly, of the Chamber of Deputies, particularly in situations in which they had been authors of laws debated or rapporteurs of law projects related to the topic under discussion. 
 In relation to the sphere of acting, there is a predominance of representatives from institutions located in national level: 67% act at the national level, 29.3% representatives of organs and institutions of the state scope and only 3.7% of the municipal sphere, considering both state agents and representatives of civil society. This predominance can be explained by nature - constitutional – of the issues under discussion, relating to the own constitutional division of competencies that places most of the responsibilities and attributions that puts in the hands of the central power most of the responsibilities and tasks in a wide range of themes and subjects. 
 On the other hand, the profile of the participants varies according to the theme, relate to the distribution of competences between the federal entities and with the origin of the action that triggered the process, and is associated with the choices made by the parties responsible for the indication of exhibitors, and by the ministers responsible for approval and rejection of requests which impacts directly on the development of civil society adopted in each case. 
 How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making 
 Generally, the public hearings (APs) are constituted as an instrument of popular[1] participation, foreseen by the Brazilian Constitution of 1988[2], that in its article 58 provides that the committees of the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate falls to, due to the matters within their competence, hold public hearings with civil society entities. There is, moreover, adjustment in the infra-constitutional legislation. Both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate have, in its respective internal rules, on the rules and procedures to fulfill public hearings (RICD, art. 255 to 258; RISF, arts. 93 to 95). In both cases, the office hour is considered a form of parliamentary committees instructs legislative relevant matters in process, as well as deal with matters of public interest. 
 There is no consensus in relation to a definition of public hearings in the academic literature specializing, but in the way that have been practiced in Brazilian legislative houses, PAs consist of open meetings promoted by the parliamentary committees, which may participate legislators, citizens, representatives of civil society entities, technicians and experts with the aim of promoting discussion around a theme or issue of public concern in the area of respective commission. 
 In the Judicial Power, in particular, the estimates of public hearings in the field of action of the Federal Supreme Court (STF) refers to the publication of Law Number 9,868, of 1999, which should be referred too to the Law 9882/99 - the first regulates the Direct Action of Unconstitutionality (ADI) and the Declaratory actions of Constitutionality (ADC) and the second deals with the Arbitration of Non-Compliance Fundamental Precept (ADPF). With this, established the estimates of APs’ attainment in the ambit of exercise of the concentrated control of constitutionality, by summoning the President of the Court or the Rapporteur of the process and with the participation of members of civil society, for the purpose of clarifying matters or circumstance of fact. 
 The Internal Regiment of the Supreme Federal Court (RISTF)1, in its article 13, XVII and XVIII, establishes the possibility of convening a public hearing, by the President of the Court, to ""listen to the testimony of people with experience and authority in a particular field, whenever he deems it necessary to clarify issues or circumstances of fact, with overall repercussions and of public interest relevant, discussed in the context of the court"". It has, moreover, in the sole paragraph, Sections II and III of article 154, about the competence of Minister-Relator to convene the AP, establishing that it should be guaranteed the participation of various currents of opinion and that it touches the decision about the selection of people who will be heard, disclosure of the list of enabled, determining the order of the jobs and fixing the time that each one will have to manifest themselves. Finally, also for determination procedure (Article 154, second paragraph, IV to VII) establishes that the public hearings will be transmitted by Justice TV and Justice Radio, that the work of the public hearing will be registered and added to the records(autos) of the Process, when necessary, or filed in the ambit of Presidency, and that the omitted cases will be resolved by the Minister who convenes the hearing. 
 There is, thus, formal procedures, rules which involves the formalization of AP (date and time set, clear guidelines, minutes of meetings, recording on video and/or voice), and the conduct of the debate (determining which actors have the word, its time to speak, dynamics of interaction). In general, the APs begin with an opening speech of the rapporteur, who gives the word to the representative of the Public ministry to present their considerations. From there, the exhibitors manifest themselves one by one according to the previously established order. Deliberative ProcessThe great freedom assigned regimentally to the minister-rapporteur to decide, at his discretion, about the people who will be heard, the order of business and the time reserved for each exhibitor, associated with the fact that the rapporteurs repeatedly exercised some kind of control over the content of the exhibitions, limits the ability of the exhibitors to include topics on the agenda and neither give them the desired treatment, which may restrict the potential deliberative character of APs. 
 There are also limitations on the possibility of interaction among participants, making not possible the regulated exchange of reasons with a view to the presentation and justification of positions and to mutual persuasion. It is possible to recognize at least four different scenarios of interaction in the APs: presentation of the exhibitors, without interventions during or at the end of the hearing; (2) presentation of exhibitors, without interventions during or at the end of the audience, but with questions of ministers at the end; (3) presentation of exhibitors, with occasional intervention to question/ elucidation of the representative of the MP or of the rapporteur; 4) presentation of exhibitors, with the possibility of intervention by the representative of the MP, lawyer of arguer and rapporteur at the end of each exhibition for questions and elucidation. 
 In general, the format of the hearings makes them more closely to an argumentation than a debate itself. In no case was allowed participants to address a word to each other under the argument that it was an audience of instructional character and even the mention of an exhibitor to speech or argument of another were regulated. Even so, there is some indirect exchange of ideas and information because the participants involved seem to already know the main arguments from each other and strengthen them or question them with the presentation of other arguments and evidence. 
 Influence, Outcome, and Effects 
 With regard to the informational gains provided by APs, it appears that throughout the work, the participants have contributed to the approach of the subject from different perspectives, increasing the volume, variety and quality of information. The exhibitions are not restricted to the traditional legal field, extending the technical and interdisciplinary issues, It's because it was produced enough material to support the court's decision as regards the possible prognostic in relation to the consequences, implications and practical repercussions of the legislation discussed, specific impacts on certain groups or in relation to the fundamental values of individuals and Brazilian society. 
 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 Between 2007 and 2014 the STF made an growing use of the mechanism of public hearings to hear the opinion of experts and representatives of state institutions and civil organizations about issues of great relevance, complexity and that involved intense controversy by potential impacts in the fields legal, political, social, economic and cultural. 
 Generally, the ministers of the Federal Supreme Court associate at public hearings great expectations regarding the extension of the legitimacy of the decisions of the Court, , as well as the informational gains provided by the mechanism to the decision-making process, although they do not always link one variable to the other. However, there seems to be a large distance between discourse and practice when is considers how APs are being applied, far below their potential, particularly in relation to the high degree of discretion of the rapporteur, with negative consequences in terms of assurance as to the equitable inclusion of the parties. 
 Considering the gathered evidences about the number and profile of the participants of the APs in the STF outstanding the potential of this mechanism to function as an important socio-state interface, to the extent that connects actors and institutions and propose the effective connection of a public discourse more general carried out in a wide range of spheres and arenas. 
 Although it has been possible to realize a process of institutionalization of APs, expressed by a change in the Rules of Procedure of the Supremo Tribunal Federal (RISTF) and by reiterating of a set of practices involved in conducting hearings, the analysis suggests that many of the differences identified between the events must be explained more by the degree of adherence, by beliefs, perceptions and choices of ministers than by other factors such as theme or time of implementation of the AP, which expresses the enormous discretion of rapporteur and its privileged position in the network of actors involved in the construction of the interinstitutional and socio-state dialog. This discretion points, therefore, to the absence of institutional guarantees for inclusiveness in the process 
 The strong instructional character of APs, the rigidity in the conduct of the work by rapporteurs, the low level of dialogical interaction between the parties and the character technical scientific discourses are, without doubt, aspects that contribute to this situation. It is worth remembering, however, that there was progress, when it considers, comparatively, the APs. In an exemplary way, the public hearings regarding the debate about the constitutionality of research with embryonic stem cells and the interruption of pregnancy in cases of anencephaly - whose moral discussions of substance are similar - showed different patterns of inclusiveness, being the last much more plural regarding the type of actors, languages, and formats discursive. 
 On the other hand, the APs performed between 2007 and 2014 varied both in relation to the type of control of constitutionality exercised by the Supreme Court, as in the case of authors/applicants involved in the processes that gave rise to them. In the context of the control concentrate, the APs were performed, in their majority into shares of authorship of representative bodies of society (political parties, trade unions, class representation entities and other civil associations legitimized for the proposition of direct constitutionality actions).Parte inferior do formulário This relationship is reversed when observe the universe of extraordinary features: in this case, which is connected to the diffuse control of constitutionality, the APs performed involved resources authored by state entities (Presidency of the republic, governors of States, tables of the Federal Senate, House of Representatives and Legislative Assemblies, and the Public Ministry). 
 Furthermore, the APs held by the Supreme Court addressed the various issues, such as the right to life, consumer protection, the principle of isonomy, economic freedom and free enterprise, Right to health, dignity of life and health of the worker, protect the environment, among others. 
 The events were called by various ministers. Since that was the first AP, in April 2007, the STF has already changed its composition seven times. In all, acted in court between 2007 and 2014, 17 (seventeen) ministers. Of these, 07 (seven) convened public hearings: Ayres Britto and Ricardo Lewandowski convened one, each one; Gilmar Medes, Carmen Lúcia and Dias Toffoli convened two, each one; Marco Aurélio Mello convened three and Luiz Fux convened five public hearings, even if it has taken possession only in 20119. 
 Considering that the rapporteurs have the discretion to decide when to convene or not a AP, we can assume that some ministers have greater sympathy for institutional innovation than others, particularly when there is so much variation in relation to the type of control of constitutionality in the area which the APs were performed, the themes involved and the types of authors/applicants, as a way of assessing the interests of the state and society. 
 The reasons expressed in the convocation, on the other hand, refer sometimes to the quality of the issue involved, highlighting its relevance (legal, economic and social) and controversial nature, and sometimes to the potential of their AP to placate the challenges posed by the construction of a decision that is crucial and involves a debate that raises ""diversified approaches"", numerous questions, multiple understandings and various controversies. Associated with the recognition of the informational potential of the APs, the convocation notices are explicit about the gains of legitimacy expected with the event, which is also recurrent in the demonstrations of the ministers throughout the hearings. The opening and closing statements of the sessions have served as a moment of reflection around the AP, particularly in relation to its objectives, the expectations associated with its achievement and its meaning, both for the STF and for the Brazilian democracy. 
 The concept of popular participation, listening to ""the people"", "" the society"" is fairly mobilized also by representatives of the Public ministry, present in sections, and by many of those who participated as exhibitors. The perception of the ministers - and exhibitors - about the potential of public hearings in the sphere of the constitutional jurisdiction seems to be based on a conceptual tripod: Legitimacy, Participation and information. The democratic legitimacy of the decision-making process is deepened by the participation that public hearings promote insofar as more informed decisions are produced, considering not only the technical complexity of the issues involved but also moral pluralism and the multiple political perspectives present in society. There is another characteristic of public hearings: they have an advisory character, since they open the possibility for segments of society to express themselves and propose solutions, although it is up to the ministers to accept the proposals or not.

 Public policy councils [1]  are permanent political-institutional structures linked to the administrative structure of the Brazilian State, in its three government levels (Union, states and municipalities) and related to a public policy area. These councils are hybrid in their composition – representatives of government, civil society and, in some cases, market - and have a bureaucratic structure to support their functioning. The law that established the council determines its nature, the specificity of your composition, as well as the objectives and the parameters of its structure and its functioning. 
 In the process Brazil’s redemocratization, after the military dictatorship (1964-1985), there was a strong demand of social movements and several civil society organizations for the expansion of spaces and opportunities for democratic participation and for the effective possibility of society to participate in the definition of public policy. The councils emerged as one of the different spaces that would enable the participation of society in formulating and controlling public actions and the results of public policies. They have been instituted in different areas of public policies (such as health, social assistance, environment, education, public patrimony, urban policies) for different purposes, which can be combined: Consultive, when instruct and advise governments in their decisions ;  Normative when establishes norms that organize a policy; Deliberative when its decisions are binding; and Control, when they have the power to monitor and control the policy (Buvinich, 2014). The councils’ focus is the management of public goods, the establishment of guidelines and strategies for action, the definition of priorities (including budgeting), the regulation and standardization of actions in a particular area of public policy, and public control over the state (CUNHA, 2013). 
 Origins and Development 
 In Brazil, verifies the existence of councils as a means of supporting the exercise of political-administrative power since the nineteenth century. In the Empire, the councils were composed of members of the intellectual, political and economic elite and aimed at reconciling governmental decisions with the interests of that elite. At the beginning of the 20th century, the social security area experienced institutionalized participation processes that admitted workers' representatives, but areas such as Education, Health, Economy and Finance, Social Assistance and Industry and Commerce instituted advisory councils composed mainly of notables and, in some of them, There was corporate representation or private interests. In the middle of the century, national councils acquired technical specialization characteristics, such as Education, which began to standardize the area, defining relevant aspects of this policy. 
 The advent of the military dictatorship not only maintained the councils in the structure of the Brazilian State but also increased its number (from 2, in 1956 to 6 in 1984), however with strong restrictions on its activities, which started to have strict government control as well as Suppression of employee representation (CORTES, 2002 apud CUNHA, 2013). 
 In addition to these national councils, in the decades of 1970 and 1980 some municipal governments have created community councils to mediate its relations with popular movements and organizations, as well as civil society initiatives emerged that created popular councils wich aimed establish pressure and negotiation with the Government, as well as the control over resources and institutions (GOHN, 2001 apud CUNHA, 2013). 
 The health area, on the other hand, developed experiences of community participation since 1979, creating interinstitutionalcommissions in the three levels of government counted on the participation of the private service providers and representatives of community entities, syndicate, etc. These experiences were inspiring for civil society to send to the Constituent Assembly, established at the final of military dictatorship and responsible for the formulation of a new Constitution (1986-1988), a manifestthat proposed the creation of mechanisms for participation in the municipalities of the country. The result of this mobilization was the registration of the Right to direct participation in the Brazilian Federal Constitution of 1988 and the constitutional provision for the participation of society in the definition and control of several areas of public policy, such as social security, health, social care and education. Other areas regulated participation in specific laws formulated afterwards. In common to these areas is the implementation of participation by means of councils.(MICHILES, 1989; TEIXEIRA, 2000 apud CUNHA, 2013). 
 As a result of this regulation of the public policy areas, there was an intense creation of councils at the municipal level, especially in the 1990s (Faria and Coelho, 2010) and the expansion at the federal level in the first decade of the 21st century. In 2013, more than 40,000 municipal councils were counted, and 90% of the Brazilian municipalities had at least 5 councils implanted, while at the federal level there were 36 (Buvinich, 2014). 
 These public policy councils differ significantly in comparison with their predecessors in reason of: autonomy of representation ”the mandates of civil society are not subordinate to the public power); Democratization of its composition (including representatives of various civil society organizations);  the articulation between participation and representation (the members of civil society have links with distinguished civil associations); and of the incorporation of characteristic practices of civil society organizations (Cunha, 2013).

 The councils are consisted by a varied number of members (prevail from 10 to 20 members) (Faria e Coelho, 2010), wich represent segments of society and government in varied proportion (Some are parity between society and government, others tend to have more representation of society and others more government representation) and that have previous involvement with the public policy area, as professional, user, service provider (public and private), among others. 
 Hybrid composition of the Councils points to different processes of participants selection — in this case, representatives. The Government representatives are appointed by the government itself and correspond to members of public bodies responsible for politics and others related to its management. Civil society representatives are defined by different means, depending on the law establishing the council: chosen through open public processes to all interested, indicated by civil society organizations previously defined by law, or appointed by the government. In the first case, elections are held that involve civil society organizations related to the area of public policy, which are previously registered. 
 How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making 
 There is great variation as to the processes of deliberation, decision and interaction with the public in the councils. In general, councils meet with some regularity (once a month is what prevails) to deliberate and decideabout a guidelinespreviously defined. This guidelines can be build by the council or by its leaders (President and/or manager table) to following the demands of the government, civil society or even to citizens. Some councils change the guidelines during the meeting, at the request of any member or even of the participantsnon-counselors. 
 The meetings of the Councils are public, open to the presence of any person, given that some councils admit the vocalization of any participant and others restrict this type of intervention, conditional to a prior authorization by the council members. However, only the counselors can make decisions.The decisions, in general, are made by vote, which requires a simple majority of votes, and only if it requires special quorum (2/3 of the members) for the cases of amendment of the Internal regiment (Avritzer, 2010; Pires 2011). The decisions of the Councils must be formalized in resolutions which should give ample publicizing, especially those which are binding. 
 There are councils wich have an internal division (commissions and/or working groups), that are integrated by parts of the counselors, who analyze the issues on the guidelines prior to the meetings. These subgroups can rely on input from experts and stakeholders to analyze the issue at hand and to build a more informed position for the debate.. The results of this analysis are brought to the assembly and and it is up to it the final debate and decision-making on the issue. 
 The interaction of the councils with the public can occur  during the meeting of the councils or in the interstices of these meeting, through individual contacts of councillors, of events promoted by the area of public policy, by different media (websites, newspapers, folders, among others) and, In some cases, through public policy conferences, another participatory institution that occurs periodically and regularly (every 2 or 4 years, depending on the area) and brings together thousands of participants at each level of government in which it occurs - municipalities, States and the Union. 
 Influence, Outcomes, and Effects Know the outcomes and effects typical of this method? Help us complete this section!Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 Studies about policy councils indicates different perspectives for its analysis, as well as different results. The main conclusions indicates that, in general, the councils are open spaces to the reception and processing of demands from civil society and that the institutional design is relevant, because this can compensate for socioeconomic inequalities and the informational between counselors and promote the democratization of own councils, as well as limit participation to those who are not organized or associated. Moreover, there are significant differences in vocalization capacity and deliberation and the types of decision, which vary according to the nature of politics and the source segment of  the counselors. Another factor that affects the effectiveness of the councils is the Existence of proactive associations and organizations in the political scenario, as well as the support and the effective presence of the governor in decision making processes. Concerning the interaction with the public, it is verified that the contacts of the council with the public inform, but do not determine the decisions of the councilors. These conclusions point out that there are limits can be identified both within the councils, in relation to its rules, as also the political-institutional environment in which they are inserted.

Please help us verify its content.  
 Problems and Purpose 
 The matrix vote is a voting procedure by which many (or a few) can choose a team or executive, such that every person thus elected will be the one considered most suitable to that posting, while collectively, the executive is, in effect, a proportional, all-party, power-sharing, government of national unity. 
 The aim is to ensure power is shared in a fair and equitable manner. The matrix vote is ideally suited to conflict situations, as currently in Syria and Ukraine, for example. 
 Origins and Development 
 A prototype was first put to the test at a public meeting in Belfast in 1986. More refined versions have been subject to further exercises, not only in Ireland but also, for example, in China. 
 How it Works 
 Any group of individuals could use this methodology, to choose a team, to elect an executive committee at an AGM, to choose an all-party coalition government, to choose a fair selection of parliamentary committee chairpersons, and so on. 
 The ballot paper is tabular, so the degree of choice for every voter is enormous. This encourages dialogue prior to the vote. 
 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 Consensus voting procedures - the Modified Borda Count, MBC, in decision-making, the Quota Borda System, QBS, in elections, and the matrix vote in governance - can be the very catalysts of consensus; hence the generic name. 
 As implied above, numerous analyses have been conducted, in Belfast, Berlin, Dublin and Tianjin.

The platform is designed to support and structure multi-scaled deliberation and stimulate reflection. Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) offer students to work on long-term research and development projects with faculty and graduate students for academic credit.[1]  Origins and Development  The Reflect! platform has and continues to been designed and tested by students at Georgia Tech's Vertically Integrated Projects be built on AGORA-net, a computer-supported collaborative argument visualization tool: http://agora-net.com/The project was awarded the Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Grant by the National Science Foundation from September 2016 - August 2019. [2]  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The Reflect! Online deliberative platform attempts to facilitate or achieve the following:Talk to People With Dissenting OpinionsObviously, we feel much more comfortable talking to people who share our views. But this is not sufficient when it comes to wicked problems and the resolution of conflicts. Instead of rehearsing time and again the same opinions, we need to talk to people whose opinions we do not share.Deliberation and Self-ReflectionPeaceful decision making and conflict resolution are only possible if people are able to change their mind based on the better argument. This again requires to organize deliberation in a way that supports reflection on one's own reasoning. People need to be enabled to identify—in the process of deliberating with others—weaknesses, gaps, biases, and limitations in their own thinking, and they should be supported to improve it.Creative, Collaborative Decision MakingRather than framing decision-making as a 'winner-take-all' argument, the Reflect! platform takes its cues from the real world of face-to-face collaboration, stimulating cooperation and creativity so that stakholders can find more innovative and widely acceptable solutions to 'wicked' problems.Gamify Public DeliberationParticipating in public deliberation should be an exciting and rewarding experience. The Reflect! platforms attempts to 'gamify' deliberation, incentivizing increasing participation by mapping the development and evolution of a proposal as it becomes more and more acceptable to stakeholders.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The Reflect! platform is still being trialed but according to its principal investigator, Michael Hoffman, it is undergoing rigorous academic analysis:""The primary goal of the proposed project is to design, test, and iteratively improve the new argument-based reflection system Reflect! that combines the strengths of the two existing reflection tools, but opens up a new world of scripted collaboration on wicked problems. The design of the envisioned reflection system will be informed by analyses of how experts, using the two available tools, approach wicked problems, assess arguments, and improve them. The effects of specific features of the new reflection tool and interaction scripts on participants’ reflection and self-correcting reasoning will be assessed in a series of experiments.""[2]  See AlsoOnline DeliberationReferences  [1] Vertically Integrated Projects, ""Digital Deliberation,"" March 24, 2017,  http://www.vip.gatech.edu/teams/digital-deliberation[2] Michael Hoffman, ""Fostering self-correcting reasoning with reflection systems (NSF),"" September 2, 2016,  https://agora-info.spp.gatech.edu/project/related-projects/self-correcting-reasoning-with-reflection-systemsExternal Linkshttp://reflect.gatech.edu/Notes  The majority of this content was submitted byMichael-Hoffmann, an advisor on the Digital Democracy Program of the Vertically Integrated Projects.

Speed dialogue is best used towards the mid-point of a deliberative process like a  citizens' jury  or  assembly . It is a useful and fun technique for participants to extract the information they want from expert witnesses or panellists. It is best used at the mid-point because participants will likely have begun to identify some key issues they want to find out about, but as yet they have not begun to compile their recommendations or decision yet.  Origins and DevelopmentKnow how and why this tool/technique was developed? Help uscomplete this section! How it Works  Speed dialogue can take different forms. During the UK Pilot Citizens' Assemblies, participants had 3-10 minutes to 'interview' or question a witness or panellist.[1] Witnesses spent the same amount of time with each small group and rotate round, like speed-dating.Speed dialogue can also just involve participants deliberating in small groups with the assistance of a facilitator. This might be used as part of either idea generation or decision-making phases [2].  Speed dialogue may be just one technique of many in a practitioner's toolkit. In a citizens' jury for example, it will likely be one of several methods used throughout the process. However, whole events can be organised around the concept - much like speed-dating. Speed-dialogue events are often about networking or used as a way of bringing different groups of people together.  Speed dialogue can also be used simply as an icebreaker for groups of most sizes. In its simplest form it just involves turning to your neighbour and introducing yourselves.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The benefits of speed dialogue during  deliberation  are that it gives more opportunity for more voices to participate. Not everyone is comfortable asking a question in front of a panel or audience. Speed dialogue offers a more intimate atmosphere.  Because talking time is limited, participants may be able to refine their questioning skills to use the time effectively - there is no time to explore tangents in 3 minutes! Speed dialogue can encourage greater focus from participants.  Speed dialogue encourages greater participation than the typical  Q&amp;A  format. Often during a deliberative process, participants get information overload and fatigue. Speed dialogue re-injects some energy into the room and can really bring the issue to life for some participants.  Speed dialogue gives participants a sense of ownership in a deliberative forum. They no longer have to wait for the chair or facilitator to pick their question. Small groups can pursue issues that maybe others in the room aren't interested in. Speed dialogue is empowering.  Finally, with experts being interrogated, running from table to table whilst citizens lean into a tight huddle and hone their next question, facilitators ringing bells to signal time, speed dialogue brings energy and a sense of fun to proceedings.

4451,method,Participatory Arts,https://participedia.net/method/4451,"Participatory arts are forms of artistic expression which enable shared ownership of decision-making processes and often aim to generate dialogue, social activism, and community mobilization. Thus, these arts offer a new medium for political participation.",0,2016-06-25,2021-07-13,110904,"""Scott Fletcher Bowlsby""",https://participedia.net/user/110904,417734,"""Jaskiran Gakhal Participedia Team""",https://participedia.net/user/417734,en,0,facetoface,,open_to,,moderate,,participatory, collaborative, community,,,,city/town, neighbourhood, regional,acting, discussion, storytelling,idea,,,,,develop, deliver,," Problems and Purpose  Participatory arts are forms of artistic expression – through media such as drama, music, writing, video, and photography – that stress shared ownership of the decision-making process and that are often aimed at non-arts agendas, such as generating dialogue, social activism, or mobilizing communities towards a common goal.[1.1]  Art historian Grant Kester suggests that participatory art happens when the creative inquiry is shaped by the participants, the art is co-authored by the participants and participants give informed consent, and are involved in ongoing negotiation about the content and direction of the process. The social interaction component inspires, drives, or, in some instances, completes the project.[2][3]  From  ""Participatory Arts With Young Refugees""  by Christina Hayhow, May Maani, Naqibul lah Salarzai &amp; Leslye Womack:  ""A participatory activity is defined as one that goes beyond “mere consultations” with participants, and “aims to activate critical thinking and decision-making, transforming participants into active citizens.""[1.2]  This engagement occurs along three main dimensions: (1) production, or the actual “making” of art; (2) decision-making, which determines what type of art is produced, and by and for whom; and (3) consumption.[4]  Increasingly, participatory arts are being utilized by individuals, communities, and organizations as a way to promote political literacy and engaged citizenship. Researchers have suggested that the ‘political/civic value’ of participatory arts lies in providing a different medium for political participation and democratic engagement.  The process of participatory arts involves a ‘bottom up’ and democratic approach to the creation of art and invites participation in the creation of the message, rather than imposing and delivering an elite message to a ‘passive’ audience. As such, the essentially democratic and egalitarian structures of participatory art can reinforce the aims or political motivations of the movements.[5]  Flinders and Cunningham suggest there are at least two ways in which participatory arts may contribute to the encouragement of political participation:By encouraging participation in a more ‘traditionally’ understood idea of political activity and/or political confidence. This has been seen to occur in studies such as Catterall et al.[6] or Bowler et al.[7] both of which show a correlation between arts activity and political engagement. While the correlation between art-making and political engagement is complex, studies such as Lawy et al.[8] suggests arts activity of a certain nature can increase political literacy and ability for democratic decision-making.  Participatory arts create a new medium and space for political expression, liberating from limits of formal political engagement. Art can ‘show’ rather than ‘say’: it can break down the barriers created by formal political language and express political sentiment directly through art. In this way, participatory art is a political act - the art itself becomes political expression, rather than a means to increased political activity.[5]Origins and Development  While participatory art is connected to older traditions of cultural emancipation and collective expression, the contemporary roots lie in the artistic, social, and political experimentation of the 1960s, including the participatory politics of feminism and the civil rights movement.[9] Over the past several decades, participatory art has also emerged in a global context[3] and in relation to twentieth-century performance and theater innovations.[10] Commended works by advocates that popularized participatory art include Augusto Boal in his Theater of the oppressed, as well as Allan Kaprow in happenings.  Francois Matarasso argues that the term ‘participatory art’ is in fact a kind of replacement term for ‘community arts’, which although still occasionally used, has widely fallen out of usage amongst practitioners.[11] Part of the dismissal of ‘community arts’ is tied up with neo-liberalism and its overtly instrumentalist aims. It has often been associated (both justly and unjustly) with patronising initiatives aimed at ‘social minorities’ or ‘the socially disadvantaged’ with an entire lack of focus on artistic excellence.[5]  Participant Recruitment and Selection  While some participatory art projects focus on engaging the general public in political issues or campaigns, other efforts offer participatory art programs to reach underserved populations such as immigrants and at-risk youth, while others focus on activities that will increase the overall vibrancy and connectivity of local communities.  For example, in Los Angeles, Active Arts® at The Music Center is reimagining how a long established arts institution can actively engage residents and bring new life to urban, downtown public spaces through large dance events, group sing-alongs, drum circles, and opportunities to practice music. The Oakland, CA nonprofit Banteay Srei uses monthly cooking events and a community oral history project to create cultural bridges between isolated elderly immigrants and some of the city’s most at-risk teens. Make Music New York brings music and the spirit of participation to New York City’s seven boroughs, with thousands of public performances by amateur musicians in a dizzying range of styles, including classical, jazz, rock-and-roll, and even Indonesian gamelan music played on the city’s cast iron buildings.[12]  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The concept of ‘co-production’ has been used as a way to describe how participatory art facilitates public interaction. For example, INSIDE OUT is a global participatory art project that uses large‐format street ""pastings"" and portrait photography as a way for people ""to share their untold stories and transform messages of personal identity into works of public art."" Participants self-organize through the website to create portraits of people in their community and then the Inside Out team prints the portraits posters and ships them back to the communities.  Participation is based on people contributing a key creative element to the realization of the art project. This can happen in the planning, design, execution, and/or exhibition.  Typically, the type of co-production involved in participatory art-making embodies some of key democratic features such as weighing diverse perspectives and collective decision making. It ""encourages the use of a collective statement but does not neglect individual development or the need for individual expression”.[13] As a result, participatory art is a careful balance between the individual and the collective and between the artist(s) and the participants. Because the context of every participatory art project is unique, the specific goals and subject matter is a negotiation between the artist(s) and the participants. This relationship between the artist(s) and participants is a contentious topic in much of the literature on participatory arts.[2][3][11][14]  Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsPolitical Capacity Building  - Evidence to suggest that the process of creating art can be especially important in creating the social cohesion and confidence needed for political engagement. A study conducted by Matarasso showed engagement with the arts can make us more likely and inclined to participate with non-artistic modes of engagement, such as local projects (including local campaigns or protest groups).[15] Furthermore, the encouragement of political interest[7] and democratic literacy[8] can encourage informal political engagement.Bridge building  - Often the intended outcome of participatory art is to to bring collective imagination to bear on artistic challenges while considering other viewpoints and making room for larger common issues. Because participatory art-making combines multiple and overlapping social networks, and in this way supports bridge building between communities.[16]Collective Efficacy  - Participatory art is utilized to build a greater sense of efficacy among community members that they have the collective capacity to make change. In fields such as public health, community development, and urban planning, participatory art in used to as a way to increased sense of social identity and human worth, develop stronger communication skills, strengthen a greater sense of autonomy and responsibility, and increase participation in political decision-making.[12]Reclamation of Public Space  - Participatory art-making programs that take place in public often shape and even define how places are used. Art-making and creativity in new, familiar or forgotten places encourages residents to re-imagine and re-purpose neighborhoods, empty lots, civic plazas and parks in new ways. When unused, forgotten, or single-use spaces are reimagined and repurposed by participatory art-making events, the public realm becomes more visible and accessible, and formerly “narrow-minded” spaces become flexible and approachable.[17]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Assessing and demonstrating the cultural value of any arts-based project is complex and multi-dimensional. As Flinders and Cunningham[5.1] state:  “Research findings have started to substantiate a strong and positive link between participatory arts and civic/political engagement. It has therefore revealed the potential utility of 'art for politics'; that is, the use of participatory arts as a form of political expression and a medium through which sections of society can not only express themselves politically but also how they can nurture the skills of political literacy and the values of active citizenship. In the context of rising disengagement with politics, particularly amongst young people, this is an important and increasingly urgent area of research in terms of cultural value and a well balanced and equal democracy.”  See AlsoParticipatory Arts with Young Refugees Artworks Creative Communities 'Get Your Pen Out' Homelessness Project  Grassroots Jerusalem's Mapping and Storytelling Project   References  [1] Lockowandt, Mara, “Inclusion Through Art: An Organisational Guideline to Using the Participatory Arts with Young Refugees and Asylum Seekers.” Refugee Support Network. 2013.

Kitchen table discussion groups are often used in conjunction with other methods as part of a wider community engagement process, as in  Protecting the Snowies  engagement in New South Wales, Australia.  During the meeting, participants discuss issues related to a broader project or topic. They may be provided with a guide or set of questions from interest groups or local governments, but there is no formal agenda for the meeting  [1] .  Kitchen Table Conversations are related to  Conversation Cafes ,  Socratic Cafés , and  World Cafes .  The aim of kitchen table conversations is to enable dialogue within the community, that is informal and relaxed. Often the discussion is part of a suite of community engagement tools, and participants can receive a guide to the issue at hand, and possible questions they might want to discuss. The conversation can be about something broad like ""what is important to you?"" to a specific question like ""what methods could be used to control wild horse populations in Kosciuszko National Park?""  Kitchen table discussions aim to build and deepen a sense of community and explore the range of opinions on an issue. It fosters community organising and can stimulate and nurture public debate:""A main objective is to give interested parties an opportunity to learn from and share with each other, create a sense of community, and discuss options and alternatives""[1]Origins and DevelopmentKnow how and why this tool/technique was developed? Help uscomplete this section! How it Works  Kitchen table conversations are hosted by volunteers who want to take part. In general, they are part of a broader engagement process or connected to a particular organisation. Hosts can then invite who they want to join the discussion, generally around eight or nine people  [2] . It may be a group of friends, acquaintances or family.  Hosts of the conversation act as a facilitator, providing participants with any questions or information about the topic. They also lay out the ground rules, ""by reminding everyone that there are no right or wrong ideas, and that everyone's contribution is valuable. The host also encourages people to listen, to ask clarifying questions, and to avoid arguing or interrupting""  [3] . One person also volunteers as a scribe.  The conversation can last up to three hours, with the general idea being that everyone has a chance to share their opinions and be heard. Most guides includes 'starters' - either questions or information to help get the conversation going.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Kitchen table conversations have been used effectively in Australia to stimulate community engagement.  Voices for Indi , a community organisation in north-east Victoria has used the kitchen table model to encourage residents to discuss issues relevant to their locale. In total 53 conversations took place with 425 participants. Feedback was provided from the individual meetings and led to the production of a  community report  summarising the views represented from the kitchen tables on issues of politics and representation and community concerns. The conversations in Indi aimed to redirect attention and dialogue on the genuine concerns of the electorate - as opposed to the agendas promoted by partisan politicians. Following the campaign, an independent candidate won the seat in Indi. Commentators have suggested that the kitchen table campaign played a role in this [ 2;4] .  Kitchen table conversations have been championed in various academic fields including political science  [4] , history  [5] , health  [6]  and human geography  [7] .  The kitchen table model has the potential to play a key role in a healthy public sphere, contributing to democratic debate through encouraging dialogue and engagement on important issues.

It is based on two essential principles – “learning together” and “triangulation”.  Learning together refers to the approach of working in partnership with poor communities, providing them with opportunities to apply their knowledge, experience and capabilities to analyse their own realities.  Triangulation is about taking advantage of multiple methods and sources of information to cross-check every interpretation and deepen understanding.[1]  Origins and Development  Participant Recruitment and Selection  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  ""As well as an approach informed by certain basic principles, PRA is a “toolbox” of useful techniques for facilitating joint analysis at the local level. PRA tools include a variety of ways of visualising or representing aspects of local reality to promote a rich and revealing discussion among groups of local people. In contrast with the questionnaire approach used in censuses and surveys, the emphasis is placed on an open-ended enquiry in which local people take the lead.""  Toolbox includes:""Social mapping, modelling and transects: enables situational analysis of social structures and services. It helps analyse performance/coverage of existing services and also identifies services that are needed but are not available.  Natural resource mapping: enables an analysis of the state of natural resources and their use. The dependence of people’s livelihoods on natural resources and the resultant levels of vulnerability can also be analysed through natural resource mapping.  Well-being ranking: explores people’s perceptions and criteria of well-being, and enables them to use them to categorise individuals and households in their community. This method allows expression of people’s own definitions of poverty or ill-being and also enables them to identify the worse-off and the well-off in their communities. Discussion on how and why households move, or can move, from one category to another is also possible through well-being ranking.  Network and Venn diagramming: examines institutional relationships, linkages and influences affecting local people, households, and community from within and outside their area. Institutions can include government service providers. The method also enables an assessment of the nature of the affect, i.e., whether positive or negative.  Seasonal calendars, historical time lines, decades matrix, and daily activity patterns: enables temporal analysis of, and the trends evident in relation to, selected variables. These methods can also enable an understanding of the interlinkage between variables.

Using both the quantitative and qualitative data, together with the value judgement weightings, the computer software determines the best options""  [2].Origins and DevelopmentKnow how and why this tool/technique was developed? Help uscomplete this section!How it Works  There is no specific selection method for MCA but in their WA cases, 21st Century Dialogue employed three methods of recruiting participants with an equal split consisting of:  stakeholders , a random sample, and people who responded to public notices of the conference. An MCA forum can have 60-100 participants.  Central to the process is a panel of technical experts on the issue. The role of participants and experts is deliberately kept separate in the MCA process. Participants (the community) develop the options and criteria for them to be weighted against, whilst the  expert panel  does the weighting. Hartz-Karp [3] argues that this separation of roles is useful in avoiding conflict during  deliberation  about the proper place of expert vs. community viewpoints.  Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCA) is a way for decision-makers (citizens or otherwise) to weigh up different options. Usually during deliberation, options are weighed up qualitatively, through discussion. MCA enables the weighing of options to be carried out in a more quantitative, rigorous manner. There are several stages.  1. The first step is to develop possible options or solutions to the issue at hand. This is done during a one or two day forum with participants from the community and  stakeholder groups . During this forum, experts make presentations and  answer questions  from participants. Participants then use this information to identify possible policy options or solutions. They also develop a list of criteria against which the options will be weighted. The task is to simply define criteria because all options and criteria will be put forward.  2. Following the forum, an expert panel meets and deliberates in order to weight the options against the criteria. Ultimately, the task of the panel is consider the relative impact of each option with relation to different criteria. For example, during  Western Australia's freight network review , 21 possible options and 39 criteria were defined. These criteria were derived from the 'triple bottom line' criteria of economic, social, and environmental impacts. Thus, the role of the expert panel was to consider the impact of each option on each criterion and give it a numerical score. During this time, the panel is provided with any additional technical information that they require. The process can take several weeks to a few months depending on the complexity and number of options/criteria.  3. When the expert panel has completed their analysis, a second forum is convened. The same participants from the first forum are invited to attend. During this session, participants review the decisions of the expert panel. Their task here is give different weighting to the criteria ie. rank the criteria in order of importance. Although deliberation in small groups take place, participants individually decide how much weight to give to each criteria.  4. The ultimate decision is made through computer analysis, once all the relevant information including the options and their relative weighting against the criteria, plus the weighting of criteria, have been fed into the computer. The final option presented is a 'best-fit option' [2]. The results are calculated and immediately shown to the forum participants to reflect upon.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The benefits of using MCA are the separation of roles of experts and community participants, and the facilitation of a rigorous, systematic decision-making process. It may be particularly useful for a complex issue where the weighing of options qualitatively may be more difficult.  However, there are some limitations and challenges to consider. 21st Century Dialogue note that in cases, although participants accepted the final decision of the MCA, they also expressed frustration or dissatisfaction with the outcome. In the  Albany Citizens' Jury , Hartz-Karp [4] notes that some participants felt that others had not been completely honest in their individual weightings, ""biasing the final results in the direction they had preferred at the outset"". This illustrates the disadvantage of private/individual choices vs. open collective deliberation to make decisions. The private element of the MCA resulted in a loss of trust between participants and ultimately, a lack of confidence in the final outcome. In the  freight network MCA , although the outcome was accepted by participants, it was not widely accepted in the community and the issue continued to be a contentious and political issue.  MCA can also become a very labour and time intensive option. In the  freight network review  MCA, the extent of options and criteria submitted meant that the expert panel required additional time and resources to carry out their task. On the other hand, another MCA conference in WA on haulage routes yielded just two possible options for consideration, reducing the complexity and workload for the expert panel.

Origins and DevelopmentKnow how this tool or technique was developed? Help uscomplete this section!How it Works  In dotmocracy, the facilitator gives all participants an equal number of stickers – usually dots, but any stickers will do. Markers can also be used in place of stickers. The options are written legibly and largely, usually on individual flipchart sheets that are posted on a wall. Participants are then invited to “vote” for their favorite options by placing their stickers on the flipchart sheets. Participants may spread their votes among a number of options, or consolidate their votes on a single option. The option(s) with the most dots at the end of voting “win.” One variation of dotmocracy uses different color stickers to signify different values, for example, a green dot means something is liked and a red dot means it is disliked.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  When using dotmocracy, facilitators should be conscious of at least two important issues. First, they must attend to the number of options being put up for a vote. There is a balance between having too few options (where there is not much from which to choose) and too many options (where participants cannot effectively review, consider, and compare ideas). Expanding the number of options is probably best left to the participants, though if necessary, facilitators could unpack different ideas that have been consolidated into a single option. Reducing the number of options can be done by consolidating similar ideas or generalizing unique ideas into broader concepts. Second, facilitators should be aware of posting options that are very similar, as this can cause vote-splitting and ultimately lead to the penalization or dismissal of ideas.

When there is concern about some members not participating.  When the group does not easily generate quantities of ideas.  When all or some group members are new to the team.  When the issue is controversial or there is heated conflict.Nominal Group Technique ProcedureThe materials needed for this technique include paper and pen or pencil for each individual, flipchart, marking pens, and tape.[1]  The nominal group technique process is generally as follows:  ""State the subject of the brainstorming. Clarify the statement as needed until everyone understands it. Each team member silently thinks of and writes down as many ideas as possible in a set period of time (5 to 10 minutes). Each member in turn states aloud one idea. Facilitator records it on the flipchart. No discussion is allowed, not even questions for clarification. Ideas given do not need to be from the team member’s written list. Indeed, as time goes on, many ideas will not be. A member may “pass” his or her turn, and may then add an idea on a subsequent turn. Continue around the group until all members pass or for an agreed-upon length of time. Discuss each idea in turn. Wording may be changed only when the idea’s originator agrees. Ideas may be stricken from the list only by unanimous agreement. Discussion may clarify meaning, explain logic or analysis, raise and answer questions, or state agreement or disagreement.

Titchener termed “empathy” the English equivalent for the German “Einfühlung” (“feeling into”)”, referring to the capacity to lose one’s self-awareness by fusing their identity with the object of perception.[5] In other words, it is the ability to understand the position of another by placing yourself in their proverbial shoes. Beginning as a topic of study for interpersonal communications scholars, empathic listening was originally studied within the dyadic and therapeutic context.[6] In the 1960s, David Berlo theorized about empathy in speech communication as existing in two forms: inference based on similar prior experiences and role-taking.[7] Berlo was one of the first to insist upon the importance of empathic understanding in successful communication, with his ideas being expanded on by contemporary sociologists, psychologists, and psychiatrists.[8]  Psychotherapist Carl Rogers went on to qualify empathetic understanding as understanding the “inner world” of another without losing one’s own identity.[9] For Rogers, empathetic communication had the purpose of facilitating personal growth in the individuals involved.[10] As such, empathetic listening has moved beyond its original psychotherapy context to be used as a communication tool in education, nursing, and marketing.[11]  One of the first mediators to write about empathetic listening as a technique was William Simkin in 1971, former director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.[12] He noted that successful mediation would require not only understanding, but the ability to project this understanding to the respective parties; in order to do so, mediators ought to consider “the emotional background of an issue and the personalities involved” just as much as the “facts” through empathic listening.[13]  How it Works  Empathetic listening is “the process of the listener attending to the conversational partner to identify the partner’s perspective and feelings” in order to reach greater understanding, so as to support the partner’s welfare and well-being with their response.[14] Empathetic listeners absorb information in a non-judgmental way, acknowledging the “speaker in a way that invites the communication to continue, and provides a limited but encouraging response” so that the focus remains on the speaker’s expression.[15] To do so, empathic listeners allow the other parties to dominate the discussion, being carefully attentive and not interrupting.[16] They often use open-ended questions, and reflect the feelings being expressed by the speaker back to them.[17]  Empathetic listeners are actively involved in conversations, taking care to indicate to the speaker that they are absorbing the information and that they are sensitive to the emotions being expressed. They often provide this indication by demonstrating that they remember information, asking for clarification when needed, and reflecting the emotions back to the speaker.[18] When it is time to respond, they ask questions or paraphrase what was said, while “using nonverbal signals and backchannel cues” to show their acknowledgement of the speaker’s message.[19]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Empathetic listening is considered “a core component of competent communication” and has been associated with outcomes for listeners that have been positive.[20] These outcomes include “more satisfying friendships and intimate relationships, better understanding” and increased perceptions of credibility and likeability; individuals who engage in empathetic listening are also often seen to be more persuasive.[21] In mediation settings, more effective outcomes have been observed, with  consensus  able to be reached, even in intensely emotional circumstances.[22]  Empathetic listening is a useful technique for encouraging the “surfacing of important information, [reducing] defensive, and [creating] an environment conducive to collaborative problem-solving.”[23]  However, there are “few validated instruments to measure empathic listening,” a necessary prerequisite to being able to test its effects.[24] However, Graham D. Bodie has developed an Active-Empathic Listening (AEL) scale that shows promise in being able to measure empathy, a direct outcome of empathic listening. Bodie conducted several studies that demonstrated both construct validity and inter-rater reliability for his measurement.[25] However, there remains a lack of a “unifying theory that unravels the tangle of underlying effects, results, and processes” of empathetic listening.

 This technique is best when there are a range of issues being discussed and enough participants to form groups at each 'station'. 
 Origins and Development 
 21st Century Dialogue used the station-rounds technique during  a consensus conference on the issue of road trains in Western Australia.  
 How it Works 
 Participant selection varies depending on the overarching method of deliberation in use. In the Western Australian example a variety of selection methods were used to ensure a wide range of community members, industry representatives, and government representatives were present at each consensus conference. 
 For every issue being discussed, there are flip-charts place around the perimeter of the room. In small groups, participants go around to each 'station' (flip-chart) and spend several minutes brainstorming ways to address their select issue. After a set amount of time, each group travels to the next flip-chart where they look over those options written by the previous group, determine their level of consensus with them, and add any more ideas. 
 After every group has visited each station once, teams split up and individual members place coloured stickers prioritizing their top three options for each issue (one colour each for long, medium, and short-term priorities). These are then tallied up by facilitators to determine the level of consensus among the group on each option for every issue. 
 Other techniques for group discussions and brainstorming can be used along with stations rounds. For example, in Western Australia, 21st Century Dialogue used the  Nominal Group Technique  - ""a structured method  for group brainstorming that encourages contributions from everyone""[ 1]  - during station-rounds. 
 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 By presenting participants' choices visually, station-rounds allow facilitators to neatly sum up the level of consensus on each option for every issue. While the initial brainstorming rounds may produce a large number of options at each flip-chart, the second stage only allows each individuals three choices thus narrowing down the available options left to discuss. 
 In the Western Australian case cited above, facilitators chose to record the full list of prioritized options (three for each issue) and present this to the event's government liason, the Planning and Implementation Committee. 
 In theory it would also be possible to hold another turn of station rounds whereby each group chose only one option from the paired-down list. This depends in part on how many options the event's sponsors are willing to consider. 
 The number of consensus options generated during the station rounds in Western Australia were ""far broader than any of the stakeholders had anticipated."" However, in this case the government was committed to honouring the public's decisions. According to 21st Century Dialogue, it was found ""necessary to reorganise the Main Roads department to deal with the new agenda. The acceptance of interstate transport ministers and senior bureaucrats had to be elicited to bring in compulsory accreditation of all road trains. This was achieved. New ways of dealing with the public on changes to freight road designations were trialled; and government policies and priorities were re-formulated.""

4591,method,Strategic Questioning,https://participedia.net/method/4591,Strategic questioning is a technique often employed in Citizens' Juries or when an initiative requires participants to formulate questions to pose to a panel of experts or witnesses. ,0,2016-09-27,2018-10-18,110904,"""Scott Fletcher Bowlsby""",https://participedia.net/user/110904,110904,"""Scott Fletcher Bowlsby""",https://participedia.net/user/110904,en,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Problems and Purpose 
 According to prominant activist and changemaker Fran Peavey, Strategic Questioning is ""a way of talking with people with whom you have differences without abandoning your own beliefs and yet looking for common ground which may enable both parties to co-create a new path from the present situation. In every heart there is ambiguity; in every ideology there are parts that don’t fit."" (Ede, 2012). 
 Employing strategic questioning enables participants to move from 'communications of the first kind to the second'. For example, the question ""why is the sky blue"" is of the first kind - it has a 'correct' answer and the questioneer learns little else about their interviewee. In contrast, communications of the second kind - and those developed under the strategic questioning technique - calls forth new information, alternative suggestions and demands creative thinking. 
 Origins and Development 
 Strategic questioning has been in use since the late 1990s. 
 How it Works 
 Participant selection varies depending on the overarching deliberative method employed. For example, citizens' juries may use a targetted or randomised selection method but employ strategic questioning during the jury phase in both cases. 
 Strategic questioning is split into two exercises: the identification and asking of context questions followed by the formulation and posing of strategic questions. 
 Sharon Ebe distills these two different categories of questions as follows: 
 Context questions reside include: ""Focus Questions: gather information that is already known, identifying the situation and they key facts necessary to understand the situation. Example: ‘What are you most concerned about in your community?’ 
 Observation Questions: concerned with what someone has seen and the information someone has heard regarding the situation. Examples include: ‘What do you see?’, ‘Which sources do you trust and why?’, ‘What do you know for certain and what are you not sure about?’ 
 Feeling Questions: concerned with body sensations, emotions, health. Examples include: ‘How do you feel about the situation?’, ‘How has the situation affected your own physical or emotional health?’ 
 Visioning Questions: concerned with identifying ideals, dreams and values. Examples include: ‘How would you like it to be?’, ‘What about this situation do you care so much about?’"" Strategic questions include: ""Change Questions: move from the static to the dynamic, how to get from the present to a more ideal situation. Examples include: ‘Who can make a difference?’, ‘How did those changes come about?’, ‘What will it take to bring the current situation towards the ideal?’ 
 Considering Alternatives: questions which enable someone to imagine or identify (preferably more than two) alternatives. Examples include: ‘What other ways could you meet your goal?’, ‘What are the consequences of each alternative you see?’ 
 Personal Inventory &amp; Support Questions: identifying someone’s interests, potential contributions and the support required for them to act. Examples include: ‘What would it take for you to participate in the change?’, ‘What support would you need to work for this change?’ 
 Personal Action Questions: designed to get to the specifics of what to do, when to do it, and how. Examples include: ‘Who do you need to talk to?’, ‘How can you get others to work on this?’"" Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 Strategic questioning can be used in several different contexts and wields various results. Some context when strategic questioning is helpful include: ""[When] your organisation is undergoing major change 
 When you need to understand the life experience, rationale or degree of commitment of the resistance to your campaign 
 You have been working on something for a long time and have run out of ideas 
 You are feeling isolated or are cynical that anybody cares about the things you care about 
 Your group is fragmented and conflicted – strategic questioning will help clarify positions and look for new alternatives 
 A group only sees one or two alternatives and needs to do some creative thinking together"" There may not be a 'right' answer let along one answer that follows from the strategic method technique. However, Peavey sees this not as a downfall of the method but as an intended positive: 
 ""People need to come up with their own answers. Questioning can catalyses this process. A powerful question has a life of its own as it chisels away at the problem. Don't be disappointed if a great question does not have an answer right away. A very powerful question, a long lever question, may not have an answer at the moment it is asked. It will sit rattling in the mind for days or weeks as the person works on an answer. The seed is planted, the answer will grow. Questions are alive!"" 
 While strategic questioning may not immediately yield a 'correct' or 'obvious' answer to the initial question, it gets participants thinking and, from there, other techniques may be employed to wittle down these various thoughts and conclusions into a managable list of points of consensus. 
 For example, when strategic questioning was used in the Western Australian Citizens' Jury cited above, various different conclusions were drawn which were then divided into three different themes. From there participants worked to draw up recommendations from the information collected. The final list of recommendations was compiled and, after being accepted by the Executive, a small number of jurors were chosen to come up with an action plan.

Occupation is usually pursued in protest against a particular policy, societal or political inequalities and injustices, or simply against an objectionable status quo.  The Occupy Wall Street Movement, for example, began with an occupation of Zucotti Park in Manhattan's financial district[1], in a general  protest  against global capitalism and its concomitant inequality. A more specific example is the 2018 occupation by University of Sheffield students of one of the university's main buildings, in support of university faculty on strike against proposed pension cuts.[2]  With the problem occupation seeks to address or highlight, the precise aim of an occupation will vary. Some occupations may serve to draw attention to a particular problem and highlight its importance. Other occupations, such as the 2011 occupation of Tahrir Square in Cairo protested specifically against the then political regime in Egypt,[3] and as part of a broader movement resulted in the demise of President Hosni Mubarak.  Origins and Development  Although occupation has been used as a form of collective action for many years, the past decade has seen renewed action and interest through the Occupy Movement which began on Wall Street and subsquently spread to many cities throughout the world.

Jams can be self- or group-initiated, or planned in advance and facilitated. The format of a jam is flexible to the problem that is being addressed.  The  Vancouver Design Nerds  outline the purpose of a design jam as follows:Collaborative Rapid Idea Generation  Participant Empowerment""A Design Jam is an idea factory. It’s a fun, fast, creative brainstorming session intended to create a range of diverse visions that address an issue. In the design, architecture and urban planning fields, Jams are employed as one of the many stages of a larger planning, strategy and design process undertaken by the lead design organization and stakeholders involved in a project. By changing the way we think and interact, we change the way we behave and respond to complex problems, therefore creating the social, urban and environmental transformation we seek."" [1]Origins and Development  Rooted in design thinking theory made popular by the internationally renowned design studio  IDEO , divergent idea generation is widely accepted as a critical phase in the design process. As design thinking became more mainstream, organizations such as the  Design Nerds  emerged and systematized multiple iterations of group brainstorming processes that are adaptable to multiple design contexts and stakeholder groups, dubbed: "" nerd jams "".  Jams have been also implemented by municipal governing bodies and civil society groups to empower citizens to be part of the generation of ideas and solutions. This is a departure from more traditional community consultation models, where solutions are proposed and feedback is requested. One such example in the Canadian context is the ""Engaged City Task Force"", launched by the City of Vancouver, when it hosted a series of public jams to generate citizen solutions to issues such as social isolation.[2]  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Jams can be events that are open to the public, or for closed groups of selected stakeholders. Jams work best when there are multiple participants, and facilitated jams flow more smoothly when there is at least one facilitator for every 5-8 participants in breakout groups.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  A combination of idea ""pitching"",  dotmocracy  for concept selection, and breakout groups make up the typical process elements of a jam. Breakout groups work independently to generate solutions to pitch back to the wider group. Sometimes this process is repeated, with a mixing of groups and additional dotmocracy rounds in between. Ideally, food and beverages are provided, along with substantial breaks to allow for socializing and conversations among participants. The balance of informal and formal activity and the element of fun within a jam is what differentiates it from a more traditional engagement process.[3]  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Some revolutionary ideas have been imagined during jams, and many have been realized, including successful business models, follow up projects, and even  public art installations . Depending on the jam and stakeholder needs, a report can be generated to summarize the ideas that emerged during the event. This can have downstream influence in the decision-making process of local governments or trigger follow-up action by stakeholders.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  A common critique of the process is that ideas generated during jams sometimes do not go anywhere. If the stakeholders or participants are not motivated to follow up, no one is responsible for ideas being taken forward and they may be lost. It is therefore critical that some level of post-jam oversight and accountability is in place before the process is started.

 Request for Comments (RFCs) is a online tool consisting of the following steps: proposing a question, holding a public debate, collecting the general audience's thoughts, generating a report that will serve as a basis for further discussion or policy. 
 Whilst RFCs can be used in any variety of policy areas, they have been particularly popular in the area of technology policy. It has been adopted by internet-governance organizations like the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Internet Society (ISOC), and regulation bodies like the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). 
 Requests for Comments is a transparent way of hosting an online dialogue, where typically users/followers can comment directly on the topic as well as each other's comments. RFCs are open to the general public, usually regardless of nationality. RFCs are similar in practice to Twitter Chats. 
 Origins and Development 
 In 1969 Steve Crocker, a UCLA graduate student, was note-taker for a working group meeting that wanted to discuss which protocols the internet (ARPANET at the time) should use. In this meeting he pioneered the ""Requests for Comments"", the label for his notes, because he wanted to make sure ""anyone could say anything and that nothing was official.""

 Like consensus conferences, consensus forums are a popular method of deliberative democracy when complex, broad policy issues require a workable if not peaceable agreement among disparate groups. Where the two differ is in the number of active participants in the plenary session. While consensus conferences call together a limited number of people (10-15) to formulate questions to a panel of experts and so come to a decision, consensus forums often involve 80-130 individuals who work in small groups to develop points of consensus (NCDD 2008). The forum format is more amenable to situations in which the policy issue is sufficiently broad to demand a range of suggested approaches rather than one plan of attack (Aspiri 2010). For example, consensus conferences tend to be used in the area science and technology to determine which kinds of advancements should or should not be pursued. Consensus forums are often deployed in broader policy areas such as sustainability and the environment where a number of different approaches may be taken to effect the same result. Deliberative democracy scholar and practitioner Janette Hartz-Karp defines consensus as ""accepting differences and working together on common ground and/or agreeing on a process to make decisions (rather than mediation, conflict resolution, or Alternative Dispute Resolution)"" (Hartz-Karp 2004). 
 Origins and Development 
 Consensus forums are not a new form of deliberative decision making and have been in use if not since the first consensus conferences in the 1960s then shortly thereafter. Western Australia deployed the forum methodology to varying degrees of success between 2001 and 2005 when then Minister of the Department of Planning and Infrastructure Alannah MacTiernan worked closely with 21st Century Democracy to increase the number of public consultations on various policy measures. 
 Participant Recruitment and Selection 
 There is no one participant selection method used in the service of consensus forums but many different approaches taken depending on the context. For example, the NCDD recommends that a Community Reference Group - made up of but not limited to stakeholders, community leaders, and government representatives - be established to oversee the entire process and ensure that it is transparent and respectful (NCDD 2008). As well, to ensure that a broad range of views and opinions are represented and that there is a balance of stakeholders and non-aligned citizens, the NCDD recommends three selection methods: ""Community members responding to invitations sent to a large random sample of the population, usually targeted to geographical areas and other relevant demographic criteria 
 Community members responding to advertisements in state wide and local newspapers 
 Invitations sent to the broadest range of stakeholders, including industry groups, community lobby groups, interest groups, state and local government"" (NCDD 2008) The final group of participants, numbering between 80 and 130, should have a roughly equal share of persons draw through each of the three methods. 
 How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making 
 After the Community Reference Group is established it is possible to work on the second step of the process while the participants are being selected. This step consists of drawing together an information package to hand out to the participants days if not weeks before the start of the actual event. The package should present general background material on the issue including both (or all, as the case may be) view points and opinions. It is the job of the Community Reference Group to ensure that the briefing is an accurate, balanced representation of the issue from both its proponents and detractors and that it highlights the key issues in need of resolve. 
 Along with their individual pre-forum reading, participants may be asked to being formulating questions for the panel. 
 Once at the forum, participants will be divided into small, pre-determined groups of 8-10 people. It is important that the Community Reference Group establish a seating chart before the event to ensure an equal balance of stakeholders, proponents, opponents, and non-aligned citizens are represented in each working group. 
 Overseeing the entire process is a head facilitator and each working group is given their own facilitator/coordinator. The NCDD recommends that the small group coordinators be government representatives, bureaucrats or head business men and that they be given instruction on proper moderating techniques. The table facilitator’s main role is to listen and provide clarifying answers whenever possible. The key decision maker – usually but not always a head government official – is also expected to be present during the forum as a reminder of the focus on strategic partnering between all those affected by the issue and policy decisions at hand. It is recommended that the individual make themselves available to all groups when needed, going around the room “answering questions, clarifying the government or organization’s position where needed, and listening” (NCDD 2008). 
 Once seated, the participants introduce themselves and are reminded of expectations such as respectful or empathetic listening and the reaching of a consensus. The briefing papers are then presented to the table with panelists representing the different points of view answer questions, clarifying their positions and highlighting the key issues at stake. Working as a group, participants brainstorm various measures and actions to be taken in resolving each of the key issues. The method(s) through which common ground is reached and the options are prioritized can vary from forum to forum. For example, ‘station rounds’ may be used to better visualize the number of key issues, the breadth of possible modes of address and the level of preference for each among participants. Other techniques such as De Bono’s Six Thinking Hats or empathetic listening may be used to help participants visualize the issue from different points of view. The forum discussions may take up to three days in order for a consensus to be reached and all prioritized decisions recorded. 
 Influence, Outcomes, and Effects 
 Following the forum, the lead decision maker chooses and leads an Implementation Team consisting of a diverse group of forum participants. The Team is charged with compiling all consensus decisions and developing a 'plan of attack'. Depending on the breadth and complexity of the topic addressed at the forum, sub-Teams or 'Project Teams' may be established to deal with different areas of the issue. For example, a forum held on sustainability may require one Team to work on air pollution and another to focus on agricultural degredation. To assist them in their endeavours, each project Team is supplied with one or more industry experts to deal with the more technical aspects associated with the implementation of the forum's recommendations. It is preferable that each project Team consist of at least one member from the head Implementation Team (Hartz-Karp 2004). 
 The final step relies on event coordinators having establish a stable line of communication with participants following the forum. It is expected that participants be kept up-to-date on the implementation process and, when appropriate, that ""the Forum is reconvened some time later to review the implementation outcomes in order to ensure that the Forum’s intent has been actioned"" (Hartz-Karp 2004). 
 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 It is important that event planners be open to criticism both before, during and after the forum so that problems can be addressed as they come up and so that we, as practitioners and scholars, may learn more about the efficacy of certain modes of action. During the forum, table facilitators will check-in periodically with the lead moderator to provide feedback on the process. The facilitators will also be debriefed following the event so they can discuss what they learned and what aspects of the process might be improved in future. 
 Participants are also a welcome source of feedback on the process either through surveys. open-ended questionnaires or in-person interviews.

Enquiry-by-Design is used in cases where an urban redevelopment project is thought to have postitive, regenerative effects on the community. This creates a win-win situation between the government or other implementing body and the citizenry: where the former requires an urban area be altered, the latter will most likely be keen to have a say in the process. The Enquiry  workshops  bring together a technical team and a consultation group to develop a both a mutually satisfying design and a feasible implementation strategy.[1] It is therefore suggested that the Enquiry-by-Design method be employed in cases where interrelated urban challenges are being discussed; while the technical team could adequately address the immediate design concerns on their own, the consultant group is necessary to ensure the design fits in with the broader goals of the community. For example, the Enquiry-by-Design method was used in  Bassendean, Australia to redesign a train station  which, it was hoped, would provide an ""attractive and safe focal point, as well as [a] catalyst for further renewal of the Bassendean town centre area.""[2]  Origins and Development  The Enquiry-by-Design process has been used in Australia, New Zealand, and England.[3]  Two case studies include  the Bassendean Train Station Enquiry-by-Design in 2001  and the comprehensive, long-term  community planning of Port Hedland in 2004 .  Participant Recruitment and Selection  The method used to select participants can vary from case to case and is primarily determined by the scope of the project and the level of actual or anticipated contention among stakeholders. The Bassenden case used a random selection method, public advertisements, and targeted invitation of key  stakeholder groups . In contrast, the Enquiry-by-Design in Port Hedland used a telephone survey prior to the event followed by a random sample, public advertisements and the establishment of a steering group made up of stakeholders, local councils representatives and members of the regional development commission.[4] The technical team is usually comprised of ""multidisciplinary experts including local and state government representatives and consultants such as urban designers, economists and architects, notionally around 20 people.""[5]  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The Enquiry can last anywhere from 2-4 days and is attended by members of the technical team and the consultation group. The first half day is dedicated to briefing members of both groups on the event process, the design principles, and project scope. As well, a discussion of the community values is held which, it is expected, both teams will take into consideration in their decision-making. This time period may also include brief presentations on specific issues by technical experts.  The rest of the first day and the morning of the next are dedicated to the development of urban design concepts by the technical team. Depending on the complexity of the project, it may be useful for smaller sub-teams to conceptualize and brainstorm ideas which are then fed back to the main team for consideration.  At the end of the second day, the technical team meets with the consultation team and relays their work thus far. The consultation team then takes the rest of the day to independently review the progress and suggest any changes.  The technical team takes the final 1-2 days to incorporate the consultation team's advice into its final design plans which are again reviewed by the consultation team before the final report is written. The final report is to contain ""the process, the community's input, the technical team's response, and implementation strategies.""[1]  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  The novelty of the Enquiry-by-Design process lies in what Hartz-Karp terms a ""live environment"" which ""provides immediate feedback to the Technical Team developing the plans"".[1] The final report is thus far more complete than those of other processes such as  citizens' juries  or  consensus forums  since it is not only a measure of public opinion but an amalgamation of public opinion, technical know-how and stakeholder approval. In short, the final report presents the convening body with a 'ready-to-go' implementation plan — both technically feasible and community approved.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The enquiry-by-design method is unique in providing multiple instances for the collection of feedback from the participants. At the end of each of the technical team's two working days, the consultation team is provided with a report not only of the design plans but of the procedure followed to create them. The consultation team is to assess all aspects of the technical team's work and may therefore provide 'live' feedback on the procedure itself. The enquiry-by-design's success hinges on the ability and willingness of the technical team to take in and act on the consultation team's advice.  As well, the enquiry-by-design method is meant to include all stakeholders — including lay community members — from conceptualization to design to implementation. While the final report is a product of technical design and community consultation, and could, in theory, be placed solely into the hands of officials for implementation, the enquiry process demands that the report be distributed to all participants for further consideration and consensual development of further action plans.[6] Practitioners looking to use the enquiry-by-design method should take seriously the continued engagement of the original technical and consultation teams during and after the implementation process if the totality of positive, regenerative effects of the design are to be actualized.

The meetings are part of a larger, continuous process of monitoring the government’s adherence to campaign promises and their use of public funds.  The  Democratic and Election Monitoring (Good Governance) Project  was initiated by the JDPC after the 2011 Ogun state elections. During the campaign period, evidence of widespread government inattentiveness to citizen concerns was brought forward as were charges of harassment, intimidation, and exclusionary politics. Sensing the need for more participatory oversight mechanisms and civic engagement, the JDPC Good Governance Project provided arenas such as the people’s parley for citizens to voice their concerns, share and discuss their political views, and hold their representatives accountable.[2]  Origins and Development  While  town hall meetings  have apparently been used in Nigeria for some time, the People’s Parley was introduced by the JDPC's Ijebu-Ode chapter in 2011 to deepen the level of effective communication between citizen and government representative. The Parleys largely build on the format of the town hall but emphasize two-way communication. People’s Parleys were held between 2011 and 2015 with nine out of twenty local governments in Ogun state.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  While the People’s Parley is itself open to anyone interested in attending, the JDPC makes a point of soliciting complaints, grievances and comments about governance from known stakeholders prior to the event. Once these have been received and vetted, elected representatives are invited to meet with the people. The People’s Parley is then scheduled and public announcements are made so that anyone wishing to listen to or  ask questions  of their representatives may do so.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  From what can be gleaned from the video footage available on the JDPC’s website, the process of each People’s Parlay varies, ostensibly, with the location it is held in. One Parley appears rather informal, with citizens and representatives sitting in a half-circle with no apparent divisions between them. There is a general introductory period followed by a moderated  question and answer session . While there is evidence of a facilitator being present at one of the Parleys, they do not appear to play a large role in the process; the conversations between participants and representatives appear entirely civil with the informal atmosphere and intimate seating arrangements certainly helping to engender trust and respect between the two groups.[3]  Another video shows a very different Parlay, both in format and proceedings. This event appears much more formal, with participants seated at long tables directing their questions to representatives sitting separately at the front of the room. The question and answer period was, at times, heated but a moderator was present and each speaker was respectfully listened to when talking.[4]  The third Parley with video documentation is, again, formal with participants seated audience-style facing the four elected representatives at the front of the room, but, similar to the more informal meeting, the question period advanced with little to no need for a facilitator.[5]  Video of one of meeting shows it ending with the taking of attendance, presumably, to keep a record of how many citizens participated and, therefore, how many were witness to any comments or promises made by representatives during the meeting.[6] This, again, would appear to serve the overall goal of these meetings: giving people the power to hold their electives to their word.  While the format appears to depend largely on the number of participants present and, possibly, the state of relations between a locality’s citizens and representatives, one thing that remains consistent are the ‘scorecards’ handed out to each participant before the event begins. A list of campaign goals and promises is compiled after the election and the scorecard provides a way for monitors to visually represent the government’s progress on each issue. When questioning representatives during the Parley, the scorecards allow citizen-participants to back up their charges with proof. The events also allow for participants to question or evaluate the budgeting of policies and programmes ‘scored’ as underway. This gives citizens if not more control, at least more oversight on the spending of public funds.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  According to Bonny Ibhawoh, the introduction of People’s Parleys has increased the level of communication between representatives and their constituents.[7] Citizens are now more aware of the government’s actions and their increased knowledge of the political process allows them to ask more informed questions thereby increasing the transparency of budget allocation and policy (in)action. Akachi Odoemene gives praise to the JDPC’s organization of these town-hall-like events because “not everybody will have access to these political office-holders in their offices.”[8] By increasing the visibility and power of the electorate, the People’s Parleys have ensured representatives respect and work more closely with constituents to effectively address their needs.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Something that is not apparent in the video documentation but which bares pointing out is the inconsistent attendance record of government representatives at the Parleys. According to Ibhawoh, some representatives sent on behalf of government Chairmen knew “little to nothing about their policies and positions on fundamental issues of their area.”[9] This is discouraging for participants wanting answers to their questions and to have their concerns heard and acted upon. Some officials were unwilling to cooperate with the JDPC in implementing the Good Governance project altogether, going so far as to ignore or refuse the invitation to the Parley.  It was also difficult, at times, to get citizens to participate but, as Ibhawoh points out, those that who attended became “more and more aware of the various antics of the government towards enslaving the people.”[10] As knowledge of this spreads and as the Parley becomes a more accepted, institutionalized channel of citizen-government communication, it is likely that attendance by constituents will increase.  What stands out as consistent across events is the level of respect participants have for the process. From what video footage is available, there was no recorded instance of a representative or another participant interjecting or cutting-off a questioner before they finished. This, it may be speculated, is evidence of the success the JDPC has effected with the Parley and the Good Governance project more generally. The meetings reflect a genuine understanding among the representatives that they are the ones under scrutiny and that citizen-participants are not simply votes to be bought and sold but politically powerful agents, capable and willing to hold their representatives to account.

4646,method,The Ethiopian Qero Management System,https://participedia.net/method/4646,An “indigenous management system” (IMS) – in reference to the Ethiopian Qero management system over the Gaussa-Menz – is a collaborative and participatory form of environmental sustainability and conservation practice led by local indigenous groups within a state.,0,2016-11-02,2018-08-02,195654,"""Paul Emiljanowicz""",https://participedia.net/user/195654,110904,"""Scott Fletcher Bowlsby""",https://participedia.net/user/110904,en,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Problems and Purpose 
 The Ethiopian Qero management system involves the creation of an inclusive indigenous regulatory framework for environmental and food governance, over a presiding resource or biodiversity system. While the basic framework of an indigenous management system is generalizable, it is context dependant and conforms to local historical, social-cultural, political-economic, and ontological contexts. Not to be confused with “resource co-management,” IMS involves the institutionalization of indigenous governance and direct indigenous collaborative deliberation over land-use, practice, and distribution by effected community members. It builds off of longstanding traditional cultural practices, knowledge and ‘adapts’ them to the contemporary realities of the resource in question and the communities involved to create a more non-antagonistic, inclusive, and effective environmental regulation. 
 There has been renewed interest in indigenous led forms of resource management and environmental conservation by policy practitioners and as outlined in the background papers for the United Nations post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals. This has coincided with an increase in visibility – largely through the efforts of independent media, scholars, activists, and NGOs – of indigenous led social movements to re-appropriate resources and trusteeship, from corporations and governments, over the environments in which they live and depend. Given the realities of indigenous sovereignty within states, methods that allow indigenous communities to deliberate and form regulatory controls/institutions based on local knowledge, tradition, history, social-cultural, and political-economic contexts, become necessary for effective democratic and environmental governance. 
 In the case of Ethiopia, parties traditionally involved over the management of the Guassa-Menz under the Qero system, unanimously appointed a headman to act as a regulatory overseer (Ethiopians refer to as the Abba Qera or Afero). Resource usage was sub-divided amongst ‘parishes’, each of whom had a representative whom consulted with the headman. Both socialism and the liberalization of the Ethiopian economy resulted in ineffective regulatory land tenure and environmental framework, leading to degradation, corruption and large scale land grabs. Responding to these contemporary developments, the Qero system – as an IMS – has evolved into the representative Conservation Council Committee – comprised of women, elders, youth, and religious/spiritual leaders – with nine peasant associations. Each position is subject to immediate democratic removal. Through this indigenous management system they collectively implement regulatory bylaws and resource use rules that reflect local conditions (ex, when to end the use of grassland for grazing or determining the length of the agricultural season which is relative to crop harvest rates). Since 2012 the indigenous management system has been recognized by the Ethiopian state and Ethiopian law, allowing the Committee to set significant legal and financial reparations for violations of indigenous environmental regulation. 
 Origins and Development 
 The Gaussa-Menz central highlands in Ethiopia, once subjected to the Astme Irist and Qetro indigenous management systems, became subject to a socialist public land-tenure regime through the 1975 Agrarian Reform Act. This caused significant environmental degradation and inefficient local production rates. The new state-centred system bureaucratized land management by introducing nine farmers associations, resulting in corruption, open competition, and inefficient environmental regulation. Despite this, the Qetro indigenous management system ‘modernized’ their governance structure under the title “the Guassa Conservation Council Committee.” There are now nine Kebeles (peasant associations) that elect representatives, each of whom is a local descendent of the Gero or Asbo, and the Committee is composed of the Kebeles, an elder women/man, a youth and women representative, and a spiritual leader. The inclusion of women in the indigenous management system is a significant shift that overcomes the longstanding 17th century practice of confining women to homesteads rather than out in the Gaussa-Menz. The Ethiopian government, in supporting the policy capacity of indigenous Gaussa communities to manage their grassland resources and environmental-animal biodiversity, implemented legal guarantees for indigenous management over the Guassa-Menz by the Conservation Council Committee in 2012. The region is now formally recognized as the Guassa-Menz Community Conservation Area. Following this, in 2013 these indigenous conservation efforts were recognized with the Mountain Protection Award and the UNDP Equator Prize. This model of IMS has become the norm for local environment regulatory practices in Ethiopia. 
 Participant Recruitment and Selection 
 Committee membership has to be sensitive to local population demographics and traditional practices; it therefore cannot be comprised of ‘outside experts’ or centralized state government officials. It is, by definition, an indigenous led regulatory process informed by indigenous knowledge, customs, seasonal cycles, and membership. This does not mean that IMS are anti-state cooperation, as this was not the case in Ethiopia. Participant inclusion in IMS is based on the populations of the affected resource or biodiversity system in question; this also extends to the number of representatives and those who sit on the Committee. All members of the community are expected to participate in the deliberative selection and regulatory discussion processes (ex, farmers need to report harvests to better determine end-season regulation). 
 How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making 
 The process by which representatives and Committee members are selected is through direct deliberation by everyone in the effected community – in the Guassa-Menz for example participation in matters concerning environmental governance is mandatory, it is seen as a duty as member of a community. 
 Influence, Outcomes, and Effects 
 IMS in the case of the indigenous Gero and Asbo over the Gaussa-Menz grasslands in the Ethiopian highlands has resulted not only in formal state legal-policy recognition, but the creation of a quantifiably more effective environmental and resource regulatory and management system than was previously implemented at the state level (UNDP, 2012 and Ashenafi, 2016). 
 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 In the case of the Gaussa-Menz in Ethiopia, participation amongst those most affected – within an IMS framework – literally determined the management effectiveness of the Conservation Council Committee. Through IMS processes, those who would have been excluded from policy planning/implementation, or at best designated a subordinate role to experts and state officials, are given exclusive participatory control. The potentials for IMS in other geographic and political contexts in which indigenous voices are being marginalized from policy or there is an ineffective exclusionary environmental regulatory system, in Africa and beyond, is significant. However, the success of IMS also depends on the willingness of the state to relinquish forms of control and to formally increase policy capacities of local indigenous communities (through instruments like law).

Most importantly, JDPC developed PLI as a way of empowering locals to advocate on their own behalf and effect good governance on their own. PLI can thus be described as a method of ‘pro-poor activism’.  The  Democratic and Election Monitoring (Good Governance) Project  was initiated by the JDPC after the 2011 Ogun state elections. During the campaign period, evidence of widespread government inattentiveness to citizen concerns was brought forward as were charges of harassment, intimidation and exclusionary politics. In response, the JDPC began implementing its Good Governance Project using three interrelated methods: Pragmatic Local Intervention, Strategic Global Intervention, and  People’s Parley  . All together, these strategies aimed at increasing the amount of civic engagement through grassroots participatory channels as well as providing citizens with the education necessary to hold their official accountable through election monitoring and regular questioning.  Origins and Development  The Pragmatic Local Intervention method is reflective of the wider goals and philosophy of the JDPC. The JDPC Ijebu-Ode chapter specifically states its adherence to the concerns of the church. In 1967, the Justice Development and Peace Commission was established by Pope Paul IV who declared the development of the people to be of utmost importance. As a faith-based organization, the JDPC adheres to certain guiding principles, namely: fundamental human dignity, the common good, subsidiarity, and solidarity. PLI is reflective of many, if not all, of these principles. According to Akachi Odoemene, the principle of subsidiary “is an organizing principle that holds that matters ought to be handled by the smallest, lowest, or least centralized competent authority.” [1]  PLI was born of JDPC’s recognition that, in order to be effective and self-sustaining, change needs to happen “in partnership with the poor” and directed towards “the social structures and relations that disempower them and imprison them in poverty.” [2]Officially begun in 2011, PLI is just one strategy used by the JDPC to effect good governance through their  Democratic and Election Monitoring Project  .  Participant Recruitment and Selection  PLI has two main goals: 1) bringing elected officials out of the confines of their private residences to commune with their constituents, and 2) educate and empower citizens to lead the good governance initiative on their own. PLI is, therefore, a two-pronged approach requiring the participation of government officials and that of the electorate. While a more responsive and responsible government is the objective, this ultimately has to begin with mobilizing the citizens. PLI is, therefore, directed, firstly, at those less fortunate in society and, secondly, through these empowered citizens, at government officials.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  PLI is just one of three strategies employed by the JDPC as a way to effect positive, lasting and self-sustaining political change. While the main activities encompassed under PLI are citizen-directed, they are aided by another model, ‘Strategic Global Intervention’ (SGI) which focusses on networking with various local and global organization to secure the connections and resources necessary to making PLI effective. [3]Keeping in mind the facilitating efforts of SGI, PLI can be said to encompass several different activities all with the goal of providing locals with “the required knowledge, perspectives and skills and to help them organize themselves into watch-dogs; to hasten their rise to the point where they are themselves able to take on and lead their own struggle for justice, development and peace with the JDPC marching beside them.” [4]  To this end, information sharing, civic education and dialogue forums are all engagement techniques used by the JDPC. Held in Ijebu-Ode town, Ijebu-Igbo town, Atan-Ijebu town and Tigbori village, these forums were open to all interested citizens, specifically those less fortunate or suffering from discrimination or other human rights violations. [5]  The major focus of these forums is to educate citizens in non-violent means of pressuring public officials to respect the desires of the electorate and to honour their campaign promises. This is achieved through basic education on civic rights and duties as well as more complex training in election observation and budget monitoring. However, it should be noted that the participants chosen for these more involved roles were local employees of the government as well as some learned stakeholders. This is justified on the basis that election and budget monitoring require more advanced levels of education and administrative ability.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Through the use of PLI, as Bonny Ibhawoh puts it, the JDPC “became less visible, while the electorate became more visible as a coalition of community institutions remained at the center of activities.” [6]  According to Ibhawoh, between 2011 and 2015, over 500 people were reached through these educational dialogues, informed of their civic rights and obligation, and, therefore, better able to participate in the  People’s Parley  (townhall meetings) with local officials. As well, the organizing of the People’s Parley in conjunction with an more engaged public has helped to accomplish PLI’s other goal: to ‘draw out’ elected officials from their seclusion and avail themselves to questioning by their constituents. While it is unclear whether or not public officials have moved closer to their constituencies, it can be concluded that PLI has, at least, opened up the possibility for more communication.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Pragmatic Local Intervention is a unique methodology in that it seeks to make the implementing organization ‘less visible’. However, ‘less visible’ does not mean negated from the process completely and, indeed, the JDPC continues to play an important albeit secondary role in the pursuit of good governance. For example, while its trained election monitors were carrying out their duties, the JDPC’s presence “helped to maintain law and order in some parts of the country where there had been high rates of violence resulting in deaths.” [7]The JDPC also continues to play an important role in organizing civic education especially among youths and in schools. As well, the People’s Parleys are often organized by JDPC staff and the organization acts as a ‘go-between’, collecting stakeholder and citizen concerns and inviting public officials. [8]It can thus be concluded that, while PLI is, arguably, one of the most effective pro-poor methods of advocacy, it is not possible without the continued support and work of the implementing organization. Furthermore, PLI is unlikely to gain any traction where there is not a concerted effort to make the surrounding political and social environments amenable to its implementation. Without the support of local officials and the networking activity of Strategic Global Intervention, PLI may be less successful at least in effecting policy change.  However, even without a change in policy, it is notable that PLI, as a pro-poor strategy of advocacy, focusses on the ability of the people to lead their own movement of change. This is in stark contrast to many other organizations that pursue a top-down development agenda. Odoemene commends the JDPC for their inclusive approach, empowering citizens irrespective of religious beliefs: “thus unlike most other such groups that constitute a political group in themselves, but not for themselves ... the JDPC challenges the state’s exclusion of any or other religious or sociopolitical groups.” [9]Speaking to the JDPC’s more targeted selection of election and budget monitors, Ibhawoh argues that the crossing of religious boundaries is more a reflection of the Commission’s close links to other, more ‘Universalist’ orientated aid organizations. Perceiving “faith-centred selection approach [as] negative,” these other organizations “influenced the Commission’s orientation to select directly from the local government councils, where it is believed that poor and marginalised people could be reached easily.” [10]  If anything, this highlights the potential trade-offs large-scale development projects have when they must rely on other entities for funding.

SGI can be thought of as a necessary component to the Good Governance project but, required alongside it, are two other approaches:  Pragmatic Local Intervention  (PLI) and  People’s Parley  (town halls). SGI focuses on networking with other development organizations and securing the resources and support needed for its project. In essence, SGI creates a fertile environment from which PLI and the People’s Parley can be effectively deployed. Where SGI works from the outside, PLI and the People’s Parley work from the inside; supplying the educational forums and participatory channels necessary for the direct engagement of representatives by the citizens.  The  Democratic and Election Monitoring (Good Governance) Project  was initiated by the JDPC after the 2011 Ogun state elections. During the campaign period, evidence of widespread government inattentiveness to citizen concerns was brought forward as were charges of harassment, intimidation and exclusionary politics. In response, the JDPC began implementing its Good Governance Project using three interrelated methods: Pragmatic Local Intervention, Strategic Global Intervention, and People’s Parley. All together, these strategies aimed at increasing the amount of civic engagement through grassroots participatory channels as well as providing citizens with the education necessary to hold their official accountable through election monitoring and regular questioning.  Origins and Development  SGI as a method of networking for a specific purpose – namely, Good Governance – began with the initiation of the Democratic and Election Monitoring Project in 2011. Networking as an activity is not new to the JDPC who has long sought to work in collaboration with other groups and organizations regardless of religious denomination, social status, political affiliation or ethnic designation. [1]  According to Akachi Odoemene, this inclusive strategy of networking has increased the ability for the JDPC to strengthen peace and increase its geographic sphere of influence. As well, in relation to the promotion of Good Governance, inclusive networking “has created a more conducive environment between the different groups and has encouraged friendlier dispositions and the desire for further cooperation.” [2]  While SGI is, for any organization or entity, an ambitious undertaking, the JDPC’s efforts were surely aided due to this history of local and international collaboration.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  While there is little information on how the JDPC chooses which organizations to actively seek collaboration and support, Odoemene’s historical overview of the Commission suggests that they are largely ‘partnerships of convenience’, chosen for their strategic placement rather than their religious, political or social affiliations. For example, during the run-up to the 2010 elections, the JDPC carried out a campaign to increase voter mobilization. To this end, the Commission worked with Nasrul-Lahi-Il-Fathi Society of Nigeria (NASFAT), an Islamic community based organization; the Chief Imam of Ijebu-Ode; and several different churches including that of the Pentecostal faith. [3]Bonny Ibhawoh notes that, as an organization dedicated to peace and development, the “JDPC networked with local and international humanitarian and development agencies such as the Catholic Relief Service, Caritas Internationalis, the United Nations Development Programme, the Mennonite Central Committee, Trocaire, etc.” [4]  According to Ibhawoh, many of these ties are not new; for example, Misereor has supported the JDPC since 1993.  Also aiding the selection of participants for SGI was the fact that the JDPC is a well-known actor in national and international aid circles. Support for their Good Governance Project would not have seemed out-of-step with their past activities such as civic education – on which they have teamed up with the United Nations High Commission on Refugees – and election monitoring – for which they have been part of Nigeria’s Transition Monitoring Group since 2003. [5]Finally, support from government officials – while not always forthcoming – was at least eased by the JDPC’s history of political organizing. Odoemene notes that the Commission has organized town hall meetings since 2007 and are therefore known among public officials. [6]How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The primary strategies of the Good Governance initiative are  Pragmatic Local Intervention  and the  People’s Parley  which seek to provide citizens with “the required knowledge, perspectives and skills and to help them organize themselves into watch-dogs; to hasten their rise to the point where they are themselves able to take on and lead their own struggle for justice, development and peace with the JDPC marching beside them.” [7]  Resources and cooperation from local and international organizations as well as local and state-level government officials are clearly necessary for such an ambitious undertaking. To this end, Strategic Global Intervention really occurs on different scales. Adebisi Alade observes that, locally, SGI involves the organization and visual engagement of “relevant stakeholders in thematic discourse on the issues of Social Contract, Sovereignty, downward accountability etc.” [8]  This, in turn, provides the JDPC with key national and international connections (individuals, organizations, and institutions) which are sometimes called on to “lobby for policy change to further make PLI more relevant and effective.” [9]Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  While there are no reports on the effectiveness of Strategic Global Intervention specifically, the positive outcomes of the Good Governance Project as a whole suggests it was a successful method of engagement. For example, People’s Parleys were held in all nine local government areas under the JDPC’s jurisdiction in Ijebu-Ode. These events were likely resource intensive and dependent on the cooperation of government officials and the participation of local citizens. Without the work accomplished through SGI, it is unlikely the JDPC would have had the resources, the organizational capacity, or the clout necessary to hold the Parleys.  Pragmatic Local Intervention was also a success with hundreds of people attending JDPC-organized educational dialogues on civic rights and obligations.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  While it was necessary for the JDPC to seek resources for its ambitious Democratic and Election Monitoring (Good Governance) Project, relying on the support of others often leaves the door open for unwanted intervention or the demand for reciprocal action. While there does not appear to have been any negative influences, it is important to note that some of the JDPC’s actions were shaped by their financiers. For example, the selection of participants for election monitoring was more stringent and exclusionary that for civic education. According to Ibhawoh, many international aid agencies take a Universalists view of participation, considering the “faith-centred selection approach negative [which, consequently] influenced the Commission’s orientation to select directly from the local government councils, where it is believed that poor and marginalised people could be reached easily.” [10]Another thing to keep in mind is the fact that, despite the numerous connections that resulted from Strategic Global Intervention, State Officials ultimately had the power to refuse the invitation to participate. Regardless of how much clout these aid agencies wield, the success of their projects ultimately hinges on government acquiescence.  On a more positive note, it can be concluded that, ultimately, the connections built through SGI were invaluable to the JDPC’s Good Governance project. Financial independence from governing authorities allowed the JDPC to “refuse, completely and consistently, all manner of political patronage from the state and its agents.” [11]  This ability was crucial to the project since it allowed the JDPC to maintain its status as a consistently pro-poor advocate and civil rights proponent.

Through extensive review of past approaches to conservation planning being used internationally, the CMP designed the Open Standards to learn from the shortcomings of past models and act as “a dynamic and active catalyst for promoting innovation in monitoring and evaluation in conservation” [1].  Initiated with this intention, the Open Standards is made distinctive by its focus on synthesizing goals of human well-being and ecological integrity; linking actions to desired impacts; and incorporating adaptation and evaluation from the very beginning of the planning process. This framework operates on the premise that conservation planners do not need, nor have time to wait for perfect information. Therefore, OS instead encourages a synthesis of all different types of information throughout the planning process. The iterative nature of this approach allows for faster implementation – instead of a 400-page conservation plan, it encourages practitioners to start with just a couple of key elements that can be revisited and made more comprehensive at a later time.  Origins and DevelopmentKnow how this tool or technique was developed? Help uscomplete this section!    How It Works  The OS is intended to be neither formulaic nor prescriptive. Indeed, the name ‘Open Standards’ was selected because the format is open-source, permitting practitioners to engage with the framework and use it freely. In the case where the suggested format is followed, however, the steps are outlined with thorough detail and guidance. The five steps of the Open Standards are as follows:Step 1: ConceptualizeAt first, this step involves identifying the planning context. Such questions in this phase may include:What do we care about and think is critical?What is the project area?What is the timeframe of the project?Who are the players?After these initial questions are addressed and conservation priorities are established, planners must assess the health of the species being conserved and determine what threats are harming those species. Furthermore, this phase is apt for determining what threats are the most concerning and what factors may be contributing to the current situation. Above all, this helps to develop a preliminary conceptual model that outlines the cause and effect relationships within a conservation situation, wherein conservation targets, direct and indirect threats and opportunities, and conservation strategies are all visually and conceptually mapped.  One way to approach conceptual  mapping  is to identify the ecosystem services that nature provides to humans and how each service links back to a conservation target and identifies trade-offs between varying targets, as seen below:Ecosystem Services as the LinkConservation Scope —Ecosystem Services—Human Well-beingSpecies—Provisioning—Livable communities (+)  Habitat—Supporting—Recreation fishing (-)  Ecosystems—Regulating—Resource industries (-)  Cultural[(+) increase conservation (-) decrease conservation]  Another important aspect of conceptual modelling is assessing threats. This could include the impact of dams on watersheds, or an unsustainable timber harvest on a forest ecosystem. As shown in Table 1, threats can also be human well-being targets, so it forces a project team to determine trade-offs through a  collaborative  decision-making process. The overall intention here is to remove value judgements that may lean toward either conservation or the economy, and instead recognize the interests of all stakeholders by recognizing how stakeholders like hunting-guides, ranchers, developers, loggers, mountain bikers, and others will perceive the threats identified in a plan. Once a more inclusive process is established, this allows for threat-ranking (from low to very high) to take place, which can be based on the following criteria [2]:Extent/Scope: spatial proportion of the biodiversity target affected within 10 years given continuation of current circumstances and trends  Severity: level of damage given continuation of current circumstances and trends  Irreversibility: degree to which the effects of a threat can be reversed and biodiversity target restored, if the threat no longer existedIn practice, a conceptual model for a watershed using the Open Standards may be outlined as follows:A conservation target of increased fish population;  Threats, such as pollution, are identified;Direct factors influencing the threat of pollution may include urbanization and inadequate zoning regulation and enforcement;Indirect factors could include government policies that promote urbanization and a lack of capacity for municipalities to undertake effective land use planning.This process would be repeated for all other threats applicable to that particular conservation target as well as any additional targets (ex: riparian zones, bird habitat). Afterward, both targets and threats are ranked based on their overall magnitude so that planning prioritizes the most pressing conservation actions.Step 2: Plan Actions and MonitoringThe second step of the Open Standards involves a higher level of detail in order to formulate a formal action plan. Questions to be asked in this step may include:What are our ultimate goals?What should we be measuring (ex: how many trees? how many salmon?)What should we be reporting on?Who is responsible?  What change would we like to see?How are we going to do it?These questions lead to a more comprehensive outline of goals, strategies, assumptions, and objectives for a conservation project.Goals  – These represent the long-term desired result of conservation planning. Ideally, goals will be “linked to targets, impact oriented, measurable, time limited, and specific.” [2, p.18]. For example, if a goal such as ‘human wellbeing’ is chosen, the project team will have to define the targets linked to that goal, which may include, for example, access to food through improved pollination and other ecosystem services.Strategies  – This encompasses the ways to intervene so that the threats identified in Step 1 can be resolved or mitigated. What is critical at this step is weighing the benefits and costs of different strategies and deciding where and where not to intervene. For example, if a goal is to incorporate climate change adaptation into planning for conservation of wildlife, it would be important to determine if the uncertainties of future climate impacts would make it difficult or detrimental to incorporate this into the overall strategy for conservation.Assumptions  – There are often assumptions made in planning that indicate how a strategy will lead to a particular goal. The Open Standards outlines assumptions through ‘results chains’, which visually outlines how a strategy will transform a ‘current state’ to a ‘desired state’.The second essential component of Step 2 is developing a monitoring plan. Doing so requires the project team or manager to identify the intended audience of the conservation act as well as the information needs of this audience. A sample of audiences and information expectations would look like this:Common Monitoring Audiences and their Information NeedsProject teamHow is the project progressing?Are results chains assumptions valid?What is working, what is not, and why?Is your team achieving its objectives in the time frame expected?How can the project be improved?Project partnersHow is the project progressing?Are results chains assumptions valid?What is working, what is not, and why?Is your team achieving its objectives in the time frame expected?How can the project be improved?DonorsHow is the project progressing?Are projects achieving objectives in the time frame expected?Communities or stakeholders affectedHow is the project progressing?  How will the project impact them?Conservation communityDid the project achieve objectives and conservation results?  What worked, what did not, and why?Academics and StudentsWhat is working, what is not, and why?Auditors, Certifying entitiesIs the project complying with laws and regulations?  Is it following best practices indicators – good indicators must be measurable, precise, consistent, and sensitive;Your results chainsWith a clear notion of who has standing in the project, it becomes more apparent how information derived from monitoring should be communicated to a project’s intended audiences.3. Implement Actions and MonitoringImplementation is by far the most significant step of the Open Standards process, as it encompasses all actions planned and formulated in Steps 1 and 2. There are three critical phases in this step: the first is to develop a work plan and timeline for short-term actions and monitoring. This step is where a more comprehensive summary of all activities and tasks needed to complete the plan and monitoring are outlined. The work plan and timeline should account for who is responsible for each task, when each task is to be completed, and the resources (financial or others) needed for implementing each task.  The second phase is to establish and refine a project budget. While the previous step includes a preliminary analysis of budgeting for each task, this is a more refined valuation of the costs. In most cases, funding has to be prioritized based on strategies identified as the most important in the previous steps. It is important for budgeting in this phase to occur in a timely manner as it only reflects short-term implementation. Finally, the third and most crucial phase, is the implementation of a project’s actions and monitoring. If monitoring involves GIS, then mapping will begin; if it entails interviewing stakeholders, then interviewees will be selected and the process will commence. This stage sets into motion all plans formulated up to this point.4. Analyze, Use, AdaptOnce implemented, the project then requires routine analysis of data to ensure it becomes actionable and meaningful information for the project team. More specifically, analyses should focus on assessing the project budget as well as the progress of achieving stated tasks and goals.  In order to use data collected to practice adaptive management, a project must have consistent and reliable data so that a strategy can adapt to changing conditions and contexts in which a plan has been implemented. It allows one to determine if a project is on track with the conceptual model and results chains created in Step 1. Furthermore, data analysis creates an opportunity to access the usefulness of ecological indicators established, and can begin the process of adaptive learning.  The CMP recommends the following questions during this analysis phase:To what extent do you have sufficient resources (e.g., financial, human, administrative, political) to carry out your project?  To what extent do you have the right skills among your team members to implement your project well?  To what extent do you have the physical infrastructure and equipment (e.g., office space, vehicles, computers) you need to do your job?  To what extent does your project team operate smoothly or are there areas where you could improve how the team functions? (e.g., communications, delegation of responsibilities)5. Capture and Share LearningFinally, the Open Standards project cycle ends with capturing and sharing the lessons learned from plan formulation and implementation. It is important in this stage to evaluate the outcomes of a conservation project and to communicate them to all audiences of the project, as well as the broader conservation community.  One important aspect of this step in the OS is routinely documenting the lessons learned throughout the process, including successes and failures in all prior phases. This promotes double-loop learning, where experiences in a given planning scenario inform all future planning activities. The other key aspect of Step 5 is creating a learning environment where feedback is shared frequently, project leaders are committed to innovation and encourage experimentation, and where both successes and failures are shared widely to help foster a community of practice, locally and globally.Sharing and visualizing conservation plans through Miridi.orgThe Conservation Measures Partnership currently offers a platform,  Miradi.org , for undertaking conservation planning using the Open Standards framework. This platform is optional, though it provides access to conservation plans from organizations globally and is a valuable resource to all those interested in utilising this innovating planning framework and joining the OS community of practitioners.

 Problems and Purpose 
 Focussed conversation is a technique of deliberation described most fully by Laura Spencer in her 1989 book  Winning Through Participation.  With theoretical underpinnings in Chris Argyris' concept of the ladder of inference and David Kolb's models of individual experiential learning and team learning cycle, this technique is meant to replicate the ‘natural’ thought process used to reflect on and address an issue. 
 This technique is often used within a larger methodological framework or in conjunction with other discussion techniques as its focus is on reflecting on prior events before coming to a conclusion. For example, a  Citizens' Jury  may be presented with the facts of a case or may have a  Q&amp;A session  with a  panel  before embarking on focused conversations. 
 Origins and Development 
 The theoretical underpinnings of this technique can be traced back to the 1970s with Chris Argyris’ concept of ‘the ladder of inference’. It’s development also owes much to David Kolb’s work on educational theory, especially his ‘Experiential Learning Model’ and the idea of the team learning cycle. 
 How it Works 
 Participant selection varies according to the overal project needs but, for each focused conversation group, it is ideal to have 10 (or less) participants. Stage 1 – ObjectivePurpose: uncover the surface facts of the case based on directly observable data 
 For the practitioner: Think about your rational objective for the conversation. What do you want the group to learn as the result of the conversation? 
 Typical questions: What did you see, hear, feel, smell, taste? 
 What did you hear people say? 
 Which objects, cards, ... attract your attention? Stage 2 – ReflectionPurpose: to access ""gut level"" responses, associations, emotions, images 
 For the practitioner: Clarify your experiential aim for the conversation. What do you want the group to feel as the result of the conversation? 
 Typical questions: What is it about the data that angers, excites, intrigues, surprises, ... you? 
 What internal images are triggered by the data? 
 What does this [situation, experience, ...] remind you of? Stage 3 – InterpretivePurpose: to make sense of the situation by articulating the meaning, values, significance, purpose, implications 
 For the practitioner: brainstorm questions you might ask about the experience or event without regard to the reflective thinking level of the question. 
 Questions should highlight the layers of meaning and purpose, for example: What significance do you attach to the situation? 
 What storyline are we living out? Stage 4 – DecisionalPurpose: to make future resolutions 
 For the practitioner: sort questions by level and cull them to a short list of not more than 10. As you shortlist, recall your rational and experiential aims. Make sure questions are specific but open-ended; avoid yes-no answers. 
 Questions should allow people to articulate their relationship and response(s) to the situation, for example: How shall we respond to ...? 
 The next time we are confronted with ..., how could/should we behave differently? Analysis and Lessons Learned Want to contribute an analysis of this tool/technique? Help us complete this section!

4663,method,PechaKucha,https://participedia.net/method/4663,PechaKucha is a dynamic presentation method developed by two Tokyo-based architects as a way to maximize the exchange of ideas while keeping the audience’s attention. ,0,2016-11-15,2022-07-15,110904,"""Scott Fletcher Bowlsby""",https://participedia.net/user/110904,421204,"""Nina Sartor""",https://participedia.net/user/421204,en,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,local,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Problems and Purpose 
 PechaKucha is a dynamic presentation method developed by two Tokyo-based architects, Astrid Klein and Mark Dytham, as a way to maximize the exchange of ideas while keeping the audience’s attention. Given less than seven minutes, each presentation consists of 20 Powerpoint slides which, given that this method is mostly used by the creative arts community, typically consist of images and, in some cases, videos. 
 The name ‘PechaKucha’ comes from the Japanese ペチャクチャ meaning ‘chit chat’. PechaKucha as a method should not be confused with PechaKucha Nights (PKNs) which, while using the presentation format, are actual city-wide events with designated organizers. Usually held yearly, there are over 900 cities with ‘registered’ PKNs. The ‘registration’ process is informal – called a ‘handshake’ by Klein and Dytham – and is renewed yearly. It is expected that there is only one official PKN per city but anyone can use the format as long as they clear it with the official group or if they simply borrow the method for their own event. 
 The method was designed as a way to draw people to what might typically be thought of as ‘dull’ or ‘dry’ presentations. Powerpoint slides are notoriously ‘bland’ so Klein and Dytham created PechaKucha Nights (PKN) as a way to capture the attention of young designers and architects. The method is also useful in many other contexts including academia since the high presenter turn-over rate allows for a large number of people to both share their own ideas and hear those of others. As the creators put it: “architects talk too much! Give a microphone and some images to an architect -- or most creative people for that matter -- and they'll go on forever! Give PowerPoint to anyone else and they have the same problem.” [1]The creators also note that, since its creation, PKN has filled an important gap in the public sphere – short of getting published in a magazine or having enough pieces to display in a gallery, most young artists (or any graduates, for that matter) have no where to share their work. PKN provides the perfect answer since it can be set up anywhere and, given its short format, participants can range anywhere from the complete amateur to the experienced academic. 
 Origins and Development 
 The first PechaKucha Night was held in 2003 at Klein and Dytham’s “gallery/lounge/bar/club/creative kitchen”  SuperDeluxe  in Tokyo. [2]  Since then, over 900 cities have taken the ‘handshake’ with the creators and set up their own PKNs often held yearly. Pecha Kucha as a method has most likely been held in thousands of contexts but, since they are not specifically allowed to be advertised as PKNs without the go-ahead from their city’s official organizer, it is difficult to get an exact number. As the creators make clear, this method can be used anywhere, anytime – they give the example of a family get-together when numerous relatives want to share holiday photos. 
 How it Works 
 An important aspect of the PechaKucha format is it's simplicity. The youngest presenter is recorded as being 5 years old which the oldest was 69. The participant selection method can therefore be tailor to the focus or theme of the event itself rather than the methodology. For example, PechaKucha was recently used during public consultations on  Melbourne’s ‘Future 2026’comprehensive long-term municipal development plan. 
 PKNs can be held anywhere and the creators note that, since their development, PKNs have taken place in “bars, restaurants, clubs, beer gardens, homes, studios, universities, churches, prisons (disused), beaches, swimming pools, even a quarry!” [3]While the number of presenters depends on the size of the event and the organizer’s intentions, the PechaKucha method stays the same. Each presentation consists of 20 slides set to advance automatically every 20 seconds to allow the maximum number of speakers while leaving time for audience interaction between sets. Owing to this unique format, PKNs have become known as the “20 x 20” method for their 20 slides for 20 seconds. 
 One of the important features of the method is hinted at in its name ‘PechaKucha’ which means either ‘chit chat’ or, more literally, “the sound of conversation.” [4]  This method is very different from the one-way Powerpoint presentation common in most office boardrooms. It is meant to excite reaction and to encourage a dynamic performance from the presenter, one that gets the audience excited about their material while also imparting a large amount of information. 
 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 The success of the original PechaKucha, while not officially documented, is obvious – just a year later the method had already made its way to Europe and, as of May 2016, over 900 official PKNs have been held across the world. 
 While it is impossible to determine how far reaching the method has become, it’s likely that PechaKucha has or will be used in all contexts where Powerpoint presentations or other speaking events have been organized. In Australia, the PechaKucha method was used in service of a larger public consultation initiative which was ultimately successful. The PechaKucha was held alongside 30 other public engagement innovations such as design hacks and pop-up events. The topic, urban perspectives on future growth and development, demonstrates the method’s versatility. 
 It’s rather telling that the method has not changed since its first inception – its simplicity is perhaps its most lasting feature. By keeping each speaker to under 6 minutes, organizers can choose to maximize the number of speakers or, alternatively, use the extra time for more audience interaction. This makes the method perfect for deliberative contexts where a lot of information has to be presented while leaving time for group discussion. 
 As well, the visual nature of the method is likely to keep audiences more engaged. While Powerpoints tend to get mired in bullet points and large amounts of text, each slide in a PechaKucha is meant to be more of a talking point or a visual stimulus for the speaker so as not to distract the audience from the information being imparted. 
 The one downside to the method also stems from its brevity: presenters are encouraged to prepare thoroughly before hand lest they be cut off when their slide changes mid-sentence. [5]  However, if mastered, the PechaKucha can be a powerful tool for deliberative innovators.

 Founded on the idea of mutual improvement, the Ben Franklin Circle (BFC) is a small group dialogue model designed to initiate community improvement through individual improvement. This method is named after an Early American Renaissance man and Founding Father, Benjamin Franklin. Among many other pursuits, Franklin founded the University of Pennsylvania and supported many local civic organizations. [1]  Central to BFCs is a framework of thirteen virtues that Ben Franklin advocated for: temperance, silence, order, resolution, industry, sincerity, justice, moderation, cleanliness, tranquility, chastity, and humility. [2]  With these virtues in mind, participants then pose and answer two fundamental questions: 
 1. How can I improve myself? 
 2. How can I improve the world? [3]It is important to mention that “Ben Franklin Circle” is a copyrighted project name for a method inspired by, and largely based off from, Benjamin Franklin’s original weekly meeting. The official website can be found  here . 
 BFCs are meant to provide a space for open dialogue that can promote civic participation. The  NCDDframes BFCs as a response to a disconnected and digital world, as they emphasized face-to-face interaction. [4]  Successful BFCs will guide participants toward actionable projects for community improvement. Furthermore, one of the virtues, industry, speaks to taking initiative and being productive with one’s time. BFCs could also be a way for industrious citizens to keep busy. [5]  Each of the thirteen virtues can be interpreted to address some aspect of personal or social life that may be lacking. While Ben Franklin’s thirteen virtues act as a framework for guiding the discussions, essentially providing a ‘prompt’, the applicability of BFCs is quite general as a model for small-scale, face-to-face, deliberation. 
 Origins and Development 
 The first Ben Franklin circle started in Philadelphia, USA almost three centuries ago. Benjamin Franklin, an inventor and founding father of the United States, convened weekly meetings with his peers and local tradesmen. Some of the communal improvements that originated in these original BFCs were post offices, lending libraries and volunteer fire departments. [8]The Ben Franklin Circle grew out of research done by the Virtues of a Free Society Task Force between 2008 and 2013 under the  Hoover Institution  . The Task Force examined the capacity of various social institutions to support the virtues on which citizen’s liberty depends. BFCs were a way to take that research and bring it into practice. [6]  It is also possible that BFCs also are a response to a general decline in social capital, with membership and participation in traditional civic organizations declining in recent decades. [7]Currently there are 16 different official  circles  running in different cities in the United States. While most appear to be in the early stages of forming and building regularity, several have gained some momentum and have held several meetings. One such  circle  in Philadelphia has 109 members and has had four meetings in the past year. 
 The NCDD describes BFCs as a collective project shared by  92nd Street Y  , the  Hoover Institution , and  Citizen University  . [9]92nd Street Y  is an organiza tion founded in 1874, with an emphasis on innovation in visual and performance arts, and a commitment to civil dialogue. The Hoover Institution was founded in in 1919 at Stanford University as a research center that focuses on public policy. BFC is part of a Hoover Institution program called Educating Americans in Public Policy, which works to enable citizens to better perform their civic duties by providing accurate information and teaching analytical skills. Citizen University is a Seattle-based nonprofit that works to empower citizens and cultivate the values of civic life. 
 BFCs appear to be largely self-funded, although some are run out of public institutions and may be provided with a small budget. 
 Participant Recruitment and Selection 
 The official recommendation for the number of participants is eight to 12 people. It is recommended that the participants are diverse, mixing backgrounds, ages, and experiences. [10]  Otherwise, the parameters for choosing participants are quite informal. 
 The official BFC website suggests monthly meetings that last about two hours. Participants should be contacted in advance of the meeting and a facilitator should be chosen. The facilitator ideally should have some experience with orchestrating group discussions, and it is suggested that they familiarize themselves with the BFC process outlined in the  Toolkit . This facilitator will then choose one of the virtues as the theme for the first meeting and inform the other participants. Participants should also be told that their contributions would be kept confidential. 
 The actual setting for the circle is flexible, though ideally should be a “conversation-conducive space”. [11]  The organizational guides on the BFC website present the meetings as informal meetings that could take place over brunch, dinner, or cocktails. The informality is intended to encourage participation from members who may not be inclined to participate in more formal settings, such as town halls or hearings. 
 How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making 
 It is recommended that the first meeting should begin with introductions, as it is ideal if the participants do not know each other. Participants should introduce themselves and mention what they do and things that they are passionate about. The facilitator should also introduce the  13 virtues  and a brief history of Ben Franklin’s original circle. 
 Three ground rules should be established at the start of the meeting: 
 1. Everything shared is confidential 
 2. Don’t be judgmental, offer contrastive feedback 
 3. Attend the meetings 
 One suggested format for a meeting is to divide the time into three sections: 
 1. First 40 minutes: Discuss the first virtue 
 2. Second 40 minutes: Discuss next meeting’s virtue 
 3. Last 40 minutes: Ask “Ben Franklin inspired questions” 
 In this format, the last 40 minutes are based around identifying current or future projects or initiatives that the participants can contribute to. Participants can ask each other for help, advice, or guidance on current projects, or they can suggest another project that they all can get involved with. 
 It is also recommended that participants stay connected between meetings using email or some form of social media (Facebook, WhatsApp, text). Some circles also use  Meetup.com . 
 Influence, Outcomes, and Effects 
 Most of the official circles seem to be in the early stages of organization, with some having held a few meetings already. It is possible that once they start to meet on a regular basis that some tangible results could emerge. One  circle  run out of Boston, USA functions as a weekly communal dinner organized by Harvard University students. They often will invite “an esteemed guest” whose expertise will determine the topic for discussion. This circle seems to be more focused on community building through weekly dinners, which is somewhat in line with the two goals of BFCs, self-improvement firstly and then world improvement second. It is possible that groups such as these could mobilize and implement some tangible changes in their broader community. 
 Perhaps the most likely way for circles to implement tangible improvements in their community would be if participants already are involved with, or know of, existing projects. Participating in a circle also can simply provide participants an opportunity to socialize and meet new people. While the benefits gained here are harder to quantify, regular, inclusive meetings can improve quality of life for participants who are looking for greater social involvement. It is possible that BFCs could simply foster personal development that can shape and refine the behavior and worldviews of the participants for the better Depending on how the circles are facilitated, they could also function as spaces for political dialogue and depending on the composition of the group, could possibly reduce partisanship. Circles will be more beneficial to the extent that participants value face-face discussion, as well as whether tangible improvements are made in the community. 
 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 BFCs are unique in the use of the 13 virtues as a framework for guiding the meetings. There are other small-scale, somewhat informal dialogue methods, such as  Study Circles  , which have similar procedures but differ in purpose. These kinds of methods have great potential to bring participants together in a casual setting, and when facilitated well, can be successful in fostering civic engagement and community-scale action. Similar methods include  Socratic Cafésand  Kitchen Table Conversations  . Methods such as these have the advantages of being relatively easy to organize and having low operational costs. However, they are likely best for low-stakes issues and poorly suited for arriving at solutions for specific, divisive and pressing problems. 
 The challenge with BFCs and similar methods is to encourage consistent and significant participation and input from participants as well as organizers. In a sense, the circle lives or dies at the hand of the facilitator, but results will also depend on commitment from all participants. The lack of official facilitator training can also have a negative effect on the outcomes of this method. Poor or absent moderation can prevent any ‘stirring of the pot’ or alternatively the circle may devolve into mindless debate.Getting the same group of eight to 12 people to meet on a regular basis can be challenging under informal circumstances. Additionally, participants are self-selected, or chosen by the organizers. This can make forming a circle with diverse views challenging if not unlikely. A possible solution to this particular challenge would be running BFCs through a larger community organization that could organize circles and compose the groups randomly. 
 Centering the discussions around the 13 virtues can help direct the conversation, but also makes it difficult to measure the success of the meetings. At what point has the virtue in question been fully discussed or sufficiently realized? Furthermore, moving from an open discussion about the virtues to making concrete improvements in broader community can be difficult. There is a chance that in the absence of a participant with a specific project in mind, that the circle may not progress past the discussion stage. However, ideas must come from somewhere, and participants with some free time may find this method rewarding.

It is a locally designed strategy which involves grassroots women’s groups initiating dialogue with local authorities in order to influence them such that women's priorities are considered in their formulation of policies and programs. It is a pragmatic way of changing the position of grassroots women from being recipients of government programs to active partners and citizens. The methodology is a long process that begins with a collection of communities having closely related problems. The identification of such problems as well as solutions reinforces the need for community-to-community dialogues in order to map out strategies to seek redress. Having realised the significance of building  consensus  across community groups on what issues they would like to prioritise, GROOTS Kenya employed this methodology to engender “participatory development”  vis-a-vis  “participatory local governance."" [i]  This methodology seeks to promote bottom-up approaches to governance as well as allocation of public resources in response to community needs. Even as GROOTS Kenya brings grassroots women together to negotiate a range of developmental programs in ways and manners that promote participatory local governance and address women’s priorities, L2L Dialogues combine women's marginalisation with social change and thus, supports grassroots women in taking active and meaningful impact in the planning and decision making processes on issues that affect their lives and families.  Prior to the violence-ridden 2007 general elections in Kenya, statistics indicated that the country had the smallest number of women in elective positions within the East Africa region.[ii] Women constituted 10 per cent (16 elected and 6 nominated women legislators) of 222 parliamentarians. Although all citizens have an equal right to participate in decisions that affect their lives, inequality and marginalisation resulting from patriarchy, illiteracy, and the socio-political environment of Kenya posed a barrier to women’s active and meaningful participation in Kenya’s democratic processes. Not only were they excluded from elective positions, they were equally sidelined in local decision-making processes. Although women account for 52 per cent of Kenya’s total population,[iii] it is estimated that about 80 per cent of them live in rural areas, working and contributing massively to the development of the nation’s agricultural sector while men and very few women dominate leadership and decision-making positions. GROOTS Kenya, a grassroots women’s movement, systematically connects women's advocacy groups and communities in rural areas and urban slums in order to create a self-help network to bridge this gap through initiatives that are not only community-cantered, but women-led.[iv]This would not only tackle their inadequate visibility in development and decision-making forums that impact lives, but also enable a shift in perceptions of women from beneficiaries to citizen problem-solvers, change women’s relationships from being seeing as adversaries to allies in development and most importantly, reconfigure power relations between marginalized people and local authorities.[v]  Origins and Development  A major distinguishing feature of any genuine democratic state is the active participation of all its adult citizens in state affairs. In new and emerging democracies, however, a large section of the citizens are excluded from public affairs and decision making. In times past, such exclusion often followed ethnic, religious, and gender lines. Despite considerable efforts and achievements of international organisations, national governments, and civil society organisations in nation-building which have reduced ethno-religious exclusion in political participation, gender bias still characterises many democracies, especially in Africa. Therefore, Grassroots Organisations Operating Together in Sisterhood (GROOTS Kenya), a movement of grassroots women-led Community-Based Groups adopted the Local-to-Local Dialogues method to empower and give a voice to those not often heard.  The  Local-to-Local (L2L) Dialogues  methodology was first experimented with in South Asia between 1999 and 2000, primarily as a model for grassroots political participation. Although as a concept, it materialised from the discussions of Society for the Promotion of Area Resource Centres (SPARC) and Swayam Shikshan Prayog (SSP) who are experts in  community organizing  and women’s advocacy. However, Asia Women and Shelter Networks (AWAS) was the first to apply the concept as a political participatory strategy within the South Asia region.[vi] The  United Nations  Human Settlement Program (UN-HABITAT) supported the Huairou Commission (a global coalition that promotes the capacity of grassroots women leaders in development and policy-making) to conduct a pilot project with this model on six countries — Argentina, Czech Republic, Kenya, Russia, Tanzania and Uganda — in 2002.  The pilot studies exemplified the effectiveness of the methodology in opening up new democratic space for cooperative effort and building relationships among grassroots women and local leaders.[vii] By the time GROOTS Kenya picked this strategy in April 2007 for its “Women’s Leadership and Governance” Program, L2L Dialogues was already being used in over twenty countries across Latin America, Europe, West Africa and sparingly in India.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  The GROOTS Kenya team works under the facilitative support of a research expert. In selecting the team, the Huairou Commission’s recommended approach is to task Regional Co-ordinators of GROOTS Kenya to assist in the identification and selection of a team of community members to carry out the exercise. This enhances the ownership and legitimacy of the process. Physical conditions of communities are often taken into consideration by the regional co-ordinators. In other words, rural communities and urban slums which obviously suffer from marginalisation are usually selected for the Dialogues. The fact that their living conditions are poor and densely settled, often within 1200 persons per hectare, makes these rural communities and urban slums a target for the Dialogues.[viii] As female-headed households continue to increase in Kenya (with a rise above 33 per cent in rural areas), the GROOTS Kenya considers such women and their communities as those in real need of the Dialogues. This consideration is also based on the fact that these women live below the poverty line with incomes less than a dollar a day due to rural-urban migration of able-bodied men to towns. The L2L Dialogues is therefore selected in order to develop integrated bottom-up approaches for their circumstances in order to secure a structural change.  Experience shows that when only a few people turn up to  town hall meetings  or a  Peoples’ Parley  that have been arranged for them, advocacy groups who organise such meetings often draw the conclusion that citizens are not interested in politics. Based on this, they often do not try different methods that suit different groups in the community. Given the obvious weakness of traditional meetings in promoting active and meaningful participation in political processes, GROOTS Kenya move the dialogues to the communities rather than invite members of communities to meetings.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  After communities were identified and selected as the location for the dialogues, a date would then be communicated to women’s groups from the selected communities. These meetings are known as preparatory dialogues.[ix] GROOTS Kenya organises over seven preparatory meetings with women’s groups from the selected communities to facilitate a discussion necessary for the identification of their priorities before meeting with any government officials.  Attendance at the meetings is usually encouraging because dialogues are held within communities that are in close range; and women’s groups are expected to have organised around their priorities before the day of the dialogue. Reports of these meetings indicate that members of the GROOTS Kenya coordinated them. Representatives of women's groups from the selected communities are given the opportunity to outline their priorities. There and then, a  consensus  is reached on what should be prioritised and what should not.  During the meetings, the executive members of GROOTS Kenya sometimes turn the dialogue into a site of learning. Adopting a learning-by-doing approach helps to build capacities and skills of the women's groups. This ensures that knowledge and skills are passed to the women's groups throughout the preparatory meetings. For instance, women became aware that they can seek guidance from the Ministry of Local Government on issues relating to HIV/AIDS and that they need to form into settlement groups to be able to address their land issues.[x]  Even after a consensus has been reached on priorities, subsequent meetings are held to review their works. At this stage, the most valuable resources that women's groups bring to the dialogues is accurate and up to date information on their communities. This information is usually more reliable than the numbers and data that officials collect. Moreover, sharing experiences by the different community groups unveiled new innovative ideas. For example, information on the pay toilets project by the “Tuelewane Self-Help Group” which addresses sanitation problems serves as a model for other women’s group and local government authorities.[xi]  After the preparatory meetings have been concluded and consensus reached among the women's groups on their priorities, meetings with policy makers and local authorities are employed to kick-off the dialogue process. Dialogues with government officials begin with an invitation letter being sent to them by the GROOTS Kenya. An agreement is then reached on a date for a meeting with government officials. At the meetings, selected group leaders articulate their priorities and government officials are allowed to respond. This first dialogue generally ends with participants looking forward to the next consensus meeting. Also, women’s groups would be broken into six groups to discuss the issues that had emerged from both the meeting with government officials and the earlier Local-to-Local Dialogues. Each group would be asked to analyse the government responses and re-strategize.  Though this series of Local-to-Local Dialogues serves as an ideal model for community based organizations to work with local authorities, women's groups in some cases successfully negotiate access to resources for their communities on time. In exceptional cases, the negotiations go on until a result is achieved. In both situations, however, the aim of the method is achieved — that is, making women understand and practice strategic engagement with local administrators, building their information base, and helping them build strategic alliances for participatory development.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  This methodology has not only improved the living condition of participating communities in four villages in the Mathare Valley of Nairobi, but has equally given voice to marginalised women. Since 2012, the method has accelerated over 110 grassroots women to local decision-making and leadership positions, mostly as treasurers of district level committees.[xii] With these women in decision-making positions, different women's economic empowerment programs have been initiated in the 3 sub-counties of Lari (Kiambu), Kigumo (Muranga), and Kiharu (Muranga). One example is a community-led watchdog program that combats dispossession of property among widows and orphans.[xiii] In Nakuru and Kitui Counties, 3500 women were organized into 131 functional farmers groups with a focus on dairy, horticulture, and indigenous chicken trade.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The United Nations Program Officer for Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women — Gender &amp; Governance, Democracy and Human Rights asserts that GROOTS Kenya’s method has a great transformative leadership process; the learning-by-doing approach to capacity building actively engages women at grassroots level in participatory governance.[xiv]The close monitoring, assessment and support received from different development partners across the world such as UN-HABITAT, USAID, Huairou Commission, and Japan Social Development Fund, has largely influenced the GROOTS Kenya's activities. This support makes the Local-to-Local Dialogues method functional in engendering participatory development  vis-a-vis  participatory local governance.  While some difficulties are encountered in getting rid of patriarchal culture that marginalises and disempowered women in Kenya, the GROOTS Kenya recognises that reaching out and working with men on women’s empowerment has great potential for this method. In other to prevent mistrust and even gender-based violence, the involvement of men is needed to help neutralize negative perceptions and make it possible to agree on ways to address the development needs of men and women.

4683,method,Q Methodology,https://participedia.net/method/4683,Q methodology encompasses an entire philosophical approach to the study of intersubjectivity. It is an interactive and reflective process incorporating both quantitative and qualitative methods to provide a robust method of studying subjectivity.,0,2016-11-30,2018-06-14,134860,"""Lucy J Parry Participedia Team""",https://participedia.net/user/134860,134860,"""Lucy J Parry Participedia Team""",https://participedia.net/user/134860,en,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Problems and Purpose 
 The aim of Q methodology is to study shared subjectivity. It is about identifying shared viewpoints. It is not about identifying groups of people, or about generalising to the wider population. 
 A Q study involves participants sorting a set of statements or pictures to make a map of their own opinion. Factor analysis enables the clustering of shared viewpoints, discourses or narratives on a given topic. Q method is sometimes used in mini-publics as a way of studying how participants' views change through deliberative participation. 
 Origins and Development 
 Q methodology was invented by William Stephenson in 1935. Stephenson held PhDs in both physics and psychology, and wanted a scientific method of studying human subjectivity. It is speculated that the name Q came from the method's juxtaposition with R. In R (survey style research), the researcher seeks a representative sample of participants and carefully selects the varables (questions or statements). In Q, the inverse is true. The participants themselves are variables, with the researcher looking for variation across individuals' views. The 'Q-set' (items that are sorted by the participant) are designed to represent as much as possible the range of views that exist on the topic at hand. 
 Participant Recruitment and Selection 
 When conducting a Q study, the researcher invites participants on the basis that they have a relevant and interesting viewpoint on the topic under investigation. The aim of the study is not to find out what the general population thinks about the topic, but to understand the range of shared viewpoints. Therefore, there is no particular benefit to having a random sample. Furthermore, a Q study requires some in-depth thinking and ranking of statements on a topic and if participants are not interested or involved in the topic, it is more difficult to complete and less significance can be attached to their sort. 
 How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making 
 Q method has been used by deliberative democracy scholars to study preference change, before and after deliberation. Typically, participants in a deliberative process complete a Q study both before and after taking part in a process such as a mini-public.  Niemeyer and Dryzek (2007)  put forward Q methodology as a method of identifying 'meta-consensus' through a six-step process: Construct the 'concourse' - this term is used to describe the range of views that exist on a single topic. It's possible to use academic literature, media or interviews to do this. 
 Construct the 'Q set' - a set of items (they can be statements or pictures) that are representative of the concourse. 
 Select participants - participants are selected strategically to ensure diversity of views within the sample. Q typically has small numbers of participants. Usually there are less participants than in the Q-set. 
 Each participant completes a Q sort with the researcher. This involves sorting the items on a grid, usually in a quasi-normal distribution on a scale of positive to negative evaluation. It is possible to do this online, but in person gives the participant the opportunity to ask questions and discuss with the researcher. 
 Factor analysis and rotation. A variety of software packages are available to do this. Most popular is PQMethod (Schmolck 2014), a free, Q-specific package. Factor analysis and rotation enables the clustering of the individual Q sorts. 
 Interpretation means bringing mathematical factors to life - into narrative, discourses or shared viewpoints. Interpretation requires close qualitative analysis and is supported by interviews from the sorting. Q has been applied across many disciplines including education, politics, psychology, environmental sciences and organisational studies.

The process includes dividing or grouping 'themes' or 'areas' of a subject into manageable discussion points.  Small-group deliberation using thematic dialogue tables is useful in several situations:When there are a large number of participants making individual contribution difficult if not impossible  When the subject of a participatory process is highly complex or interdependent (such as environmental or health issues)In these cases, thematic dialogue tables allow a large group to be broken into small discussion tables each facilitated by one or more moderators.  Deliberation  will then proceed according to pre-determined themes or areas of contention with the option to discuss them as a whole at the end. For example, issues of health care delivery are often complex and interdependent. In these cases, table discussions may be around themes such as 'Funding', 'Areas of Operation', and 'Services Offered'.  Origins and DevelopmentKnow how this tool or technique was developed? Help uscomplete this section!    How it Works  Participant selection varies with the overarching deliberation or participatory method being used. For example, thematic dialogue tables may be used during participatory planning initiatives or consultations which may be open to all.  Thematic dialogue tables can be incorporated into larger, 'overarching' participatory processes such as  Citizens' Juries  or Participatory Planning Initiatives. Tables often come into use after participants have been briefed on the subject material or have had a  Q&amp;A session with elected officials or experts .  An example of this method's use was during a  participatory planning initiative in Tuscany over the redevelopment of an airport . After hearing from experts, participants were divided into groups to discuss the project and its impact according to five themes:Project features  Air quality and noise impacts  Landscape and water network vulnerability  Project costs and economic impact  Regulatory and procedural implementation aspectsEach table was assigned a facilitator who was responsible for systematically recording the proceedings of each round of deliberation. Afterwards, each group presented their conclusions to the rest of the participants (over 300) and all reports were made publicly available on a website for further feedback and comment.

This method of funding has gained new popularity thanks to the increased use and dissemination of  information and communication technologies (ICT)  among the general population in many countries. Apps and online services such as Paypal, GoFundMe, IndieGoGo and Kickstarter facilitate the donation or fund-transfer process between individuals and fund-seekers. With barriers to funding decreased, small organizations – so called ‘start-ups’ – and grassroots projects are better able to compete with large corporations that often have multinational sources of revenue through stock or shareholders on the public market.  The increasing dominance of large, multinational corporations leaves little room in the market for small entrepreneurs and grassroots initiatives. However, the increasing use of ICT around the world has given many of these start-ups direct access to an audience of potentially interested funders. New technologies have made  crowdsourcing  a viable funding option which signals a shift aware from the volatile, consumer driven world of the public market. Now, anyone with an internet connection can donate as much or as little as they see fit to projects and ventures they find worthwhile.  Origins and Development  Crowdfunding is not a new phenomenon. Conceived as an alternative finance model, crowdfunding traces its roots back to early book-publishing days with the use of ‘praenumeration’ or subscription schemes. Often, authors and publishers would advertise upcoming titles or new projects in books with the option to mail-in or deliver funds to a fixed address. Improvements in various technologies such as communications and travel has made crowdfunding an increasingly viable financial model on which to launch or carry-out various projects. The newspaper, for example, was used to raise funds for the Statue of Liberty when government financers failed to deliver.[1] Use of the internet for crowdfunding became popular in the late 1990s and has since become a multi-billion-dollar source of finance. Forbes estimates that crowdfunding may supplant venture capital as the main source of finance. From $880 million dollars pulled in in 2010 to $16 billion in 2014 and $34 billion in 2015, the eclipse of the venture capital market is expected in the near future.[2]  How it Works  Funders are largely self-selected although some projects may have enough base-line income to target certain audiences through media and advertising. Public video-hosting sites such as YouTube have often been used by projects and organizations to disseminate their message to a large audience in the hope of attracting donors. The choice of crowdfunding platform is up to the organizers.  Crowdsourcing generally involves three parties: those seeking funds, the ‘crowd’ of potential backers, and a mediating platform between the two. The decision to use crowdfunding as a source of finance is wholly up to those involved in the project. While initially more of an ‘alternative’ financing model (compared with that of venture capitalists), crowdfunding has become a more accepted funding method used by, among others, NGOs, entrepreneurs, tech start-ups and artistic projects.  The amount of say funders have over the final result is often limited. While crowdfunding is technically a form of crowdsourcing, its emphasis is on financial assets – whether in USD or electronic currency – not ideas. Most often, those who invest a base-line amount at the beginning (which largely depends on the estimated final cost) are promised one or more units of the final product. For example, ‘Star Citizen’ is the second-highest grossing crowdfunded venture with pre-purchase in-game items offered as pledges on the developer’s website.[3] Alternatively, crowdfunding can be used for charitable ventures with willing financiers receiving a proof of purchase and the knowledge that they are supporting a cause they care about.  Inherent in the crowdsourcing model and, indeed, in any form of investment is the potential for the project to fail. The ‘grassroots’ or ‘small-time’ nature of fund-seekers is both positive and negative. On the one hand, some projects have few – if any – staff and there may be more open dialogue between creator and backer which increases trust levels. On the other hand, originators may mislead their backers (willingly or not) as to their operational capacity which turns out to be insufficient to the fulfilment of their goals. In any case, the risk inherent in investment is assumed to be known by backers and neither the project creator nor the payment mediator claim responsibility for partial or complete project failure.  The role of mediator is most commonly played by web platforms such as KickStarter and PayPal. Usually, fund-seeking developers retain control over their products’ copyrights or trademarks but allow their host to take a share of the funds raised. Fees collected depend on, for example, number of services offered such as EFT compatibility or acceptance of electronic currency. Mediating platforms also contain lengthy terms-of-use agreements which restrict the kind of projects individuals or organizations can fund. For example, projects whose end use is deemed unlawful may be shut down.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  While the crowdfunding model requires significant trust on the side of backers and acceptance of mediator’s terms-of-use (including charges), it nevertheless represents a fundamental democratization of the entrepreneurial market. Small-time ventures such as experimental technologies, art projects and humanitarian work have often struggled to convince investors using a venture capitalist scheme since the public market is dominated by large corporations. By allowing the transfer of micro-payments between creators and individual citizens, crowdfunding offers small-time developers the ability to ‘get a foot in the door’. At the very least, developers are often able to raise enough money to accomplish their objectives although this does not necessarily translate into profitability. Regardless, those with a specific goal or project in mind can now submit their ideas to the online ‘crowd’ and allow individual interest – rather than market demand – to determine its worth.  The outcomes of crowdfunding are numerous. Examples of projects funded through this model include Oculus Rift – the first publicly accessible virtual reality headset which has spurred studies on it’s potential to build empathy and social trust. As well, crowdfunding entered the world of politics in a significant way in 2014 when Lawrence Lessig created the ‘Mayday PAC’ with the intent to convince the United States Congress to reform campaign finance laws.[4]  The fact that crowdfunding is predicted to eclipse venture capitalism in terms of financial viability is testament to its success. A more detailed analysis of the trade-offs inherent in the funding model is required here but a few points can be made. First, the model makes it easier for entrepreneurial ventures to gain investors since the minimum payment required of individuals is usually quite low. Second, while the model does not reduce the risk of failure, it prevents investors from holding creators responsible for their inability to complete a project. It may be found that this lack of accountability lessons the incentive to invest; however, this may be made up for by the increased number of potential investors. Finally, the increase in consumer/investor agency is a welcome change in a world increasingly controlled by multinational corporations operating in the global market economy.

Ideally, a focus group should provide the research or decision-maker a detailed idea of the concerns of a given community [1]. They may be useful at different stages of policy development; early on they can provide an insight into the kinds of issues and values that are of concern. Later on, they may be used to garner views on a proposed policy.  Focus groups may also form one part of a broader engagement process, used to help practitioners and policymakers frame an issue or define the scope of a planned engagement process [2]. They can be particularly useful during the preliminary stage of a participatory project, to help identify and define problems, which are then considered by stakeholders and citizens at a later stage using a different method.  A focus group can be employed in political situations although gathering feedback on, for example, legislation often follows a much more rigorous and publicly transparent model such as a Citizens' Jury . Focus groups are commonly employed by community committees and neighbourhood associations as a means of collecting public feedback and opinion.  Origins and Development  Focus groups were developed as an academic qualitative research method in the early 20th Century. Since then they have been used by a wider variety of groups including the US military and activist groups [3].  Focus groups have become closely associated with market research and the market testing of products. Whilst the market testing approach can also be applied to public engagement, whereby policymakers may engage with the public to ‘test out’ a new policy and see if it is viable [4], focus groups have been tweaked and developed over the years to accommodate different needs and purposes. It is possible to follow a less structured approach in a focus group whereby participants discuss primarily amongst themselves and are less directed by the moderator/facilitator [3].  How it Works  Participant selection will vary according to the organiser, their needs and resources. A focus group may target a specific demographic from which participants can be invited. Selection can be random to enhance representativeness, although it is worth noting that the numbers in a focus group are generally so small (8-15) that even with a more ‘representative’ sample, results cannot legitimately be generalized. Alternatively, participants may be selected purposely, if the organiser requires insight into a specific viewpoint, rather than a range of views [1].  Focus groups originally evolved as a form of group interview, but have developed since then and in research terms, sit somewhere between “between individual interviews where only one respondent is involved in a considerably structured setting and participant observation where many participants are involved in a relatively unstructured of ‘natural’ setting” [3,p4].  A focus group is led by a moderator or facilitator who asks the group to respond to some combination of open and closed questions. It is generally held over a period of 1 – 4 hours and can be carried out as part of a series or as a one-off event. An audio recording may be created, which is then transcribed into text for analysis.  The actual process of a focus group varies in practice. Liamputtong [3] identifies broadly two different approaches: the more structured focus typically used in market research, where the moderator seeks to elicit answers to specific question/s from participants, and a less structured approach favoured by social scientists. The latter approach involves a hands-off approach with the moderator facilitating discussion rather than steering it, and participants talking more amongst themselves.  Although less resource and time intensive than many methods of public engagement and participation, focus groups still require a decent amount of planning and preparation. Jensen [5] recommends at least 4-6 weeks to allow time for recruitment of participants and preparation. For issues that are not well-known amongst the target participants, organisers may need to prepare briefing materials and background information.  The focus group itself can take different forms, again according to the organiser’s needs. The role of the facilitator is key to whether the group follows a more or less structured approach; the participants must feel comfortable enough to share their opinions freely [3], although in practice, it is still possible that some participants will speak more than others. This may be mitigated by effective facilitation although it is a potential weakness of any group discussion setting that the more articulate and confident dominate the conversation.  There is no need for participants to reach a collective decision, consensus or even agreement on the topic discussed – this is simply not the aim of a focus group. As mentioned above, focus groups may form one component of a broader engagement process that utilizes other methods.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Through  deliberation  and preference/opinion articulation, results of a focus group may be relayed to government officials by community members or else used to inform their own decisions and subsequent actions. However, decision-makers are usually under no obligation to act upon this feedback.  In academic research, focus group data may be used in a variety of ways as part of a qualitative analysis, illuminating important values and views on a given issue. The information garnered from a focus group is generally at the disposal of the researcher or organiser and can be used as they see fit [2].  A potential problem in a focus group is similar to that found in the interview. Participants may regard the moderator (in the case of the interview, the interviewer), and even the clinical context itself, as a motivation to answer questions in ways that diverge from participants' actual opinions. Furthermore, participants may not feel comfortable sharing their honest opinions with an unfamiliar group, skewing the results [1].  Focus groups, whilst useful in illuminating participants’ views on an issue, are not geared towards developing participants’ views or thinking. For example, whilst a focus group may highlight divergent views on a topic, there is nothing inherent within the method that seeks to address differences or help the affected community resolve disagreements [2]. For that reason, focus groups on controversial issues should be approached with caution and carefully considered by organisers before proceeding [5]. In these cases, a highly skilled facilitator is even more necessary, along with briefing and ground rules established at the outset of the discussion.  Due to the small number of participants in a focus group, it would be unwise to generalise the results to a wider population or to claim some kind of democratic legitimacy in the outcome. In addition, as they are a controlled process directed by the organiser, focus groups are vulnerable to criticisms such as ‘who was invited?’, ‘why wasn’t I invited?’ and ‘why should I trust the outcome?’ [2].

Please help us complete it.Problems and Purpose 
 The starting point for the proposal of the National System of Social Participation was the desire of the federal government to improve participation to the point of making it a method of government in which all subjects and areas of government, at some point, experienced participation of civil society. To this end, the system established a series of objectives focused on broadening the channels of dialogue between the State and civil society and on mechanisms for articulation between participatory institutions and other government bodies. 
 The National Policy of Social Participation (NPSP) was born with promulgation of the decree 8.243 signed by the president Dilma Rousseff on May 14th, 2014. The decree implements the National Policy of Social Participation (NPSP) that explicits the principles and general guidelines of the social participation that concerns to a government management and defines the role of the State as a promotor agent of humans rights to participation, making the social participation, the govern method (Maldos e Pontual, 2012). 
 The core of the National Policy of Participation encounter in two main words: interdependence and integration. In a country where there are more than 10.000 municipal councils, hundreds of experiences of participatory budgets, thousands of ombudsman's offices, dozens of nationals councils and conference, dialogue tables, among others ways of participation, the implementation of the National Policy of Participation takes place with the objective of deepening relations between instances that interact, enabling the sharing of common objectives, aiming the improvement and strengthening of democracy. 
 Although the decree doesn’t create any new council, commission or body in the federal public administration, nor withdraws any of the prerogatives of the National Congress, was the target of many criticisms and accusations, stigmatized as “bolivarian”, “coupist”, “totalitarian” e “opportunistic”, under the serious stigma of threatening the representative character of the Brazilian democracy (Lavalle, 2014). Faced with such repercussion, the decree was overthrown by the Senate in 2015. 
 Origins and Development 
 The idea of a National System of Participation arises in the first mandate of Lula government (2003 to 2006), in response to the necessity of articulate and integrate the multiple participation spaces with extremely plural and diverse features, existing not only at the federal level of the government, but also in the states and brazilians municipalities, making the participatiory decisions closer of the government and consequently more effective. So that, since 2005, have been discussed an institutional format of integration of social participation in Brazil whose objective is turn the social participation into a method of government and state management  (Maldos e Pontual, 2012). 
 Since 2007 began series of cycles of debates for the discussion and preparation of a National System of Social Participations. Between the years of 2011 and 2013 were performed 45 debates with councils, society organizations and different bodies of federal government, to then proceed the initial preparation of the Draft Decree of the National Policy of Social Participation. The draft was submitted to public query, by the internet, between July 18th and September 06th of 2013, period in which the population could opine and give their considerations about the decree. Subsequently, the draft was revised and the contributions left by civil society were added. In addition, the government held the Forum of State Secretaries, with the objective of elaborating the term of adhesion of the National Commitment for Social Participation, which is one of the great institutional innovations of decree 8.243, which will be better explored ahead. 
 The National System reflects part of the theoretical debate ever developed in Anglo-Saxon countries about the so-called deliberative systems, which exposes the need to examine the interconnection between different deliberative arenas, not only institutional, linking daily conversations, with free demonstrations and discussions on participatory institutions (Mansbrigde et al, 2012). An idea of a deliberative system consists of an interconnection and public exchange of reasons, in which the deliberation is not space-temporally restricted (Mendonça, 2008). The construction of the National Participation System has taken the direction in establishing, even institutionally, integration mechanisms among the different formats that the deliberation can take. 
 How it Works 
 The starting point to the implementation of the National System of Social Participation was the desire of the federal government to improve social participation, a mark of the PT governments in Brazil, to the point of making it a method of government, in which all the themes and areas of Government at some point pass through the participation of civil society. To this end, the system established a series of objectives focused on broadening the channels of dialogue between state and civil society and mechanisms of articulation among participatory institutions and other governing bodies. 
 One of the main articulation mechanisms instituted by decree 8.243 / 2014 was the National Commitment for Social Participation, which calls on the three spheres of government (Union, states and municipalities) to adhere to the commitment. The commitment is guided by the articulation between the government structures responsible for participation in each of the federative levels, in order to commit to guarantee the civil society a better intersectorality among the local participatory spaces and its interaction with the other spheres of government, preventing overlapping or repetitions of decisions. In addition, the commitment requires that the municipality or the state that adheres to the commitment must publish within 120 days a plan of action for the improvement of social participation in its locality following the standards of the national system. Until the decree fell, there were 10 states and 37 Brazilian municipalities that adhered to the national commitment. 
 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 Another point of institutional innovation coming from the SNPS was the inclusion of citizens who are not linked to any formal institution, opening space for participation also through social networks. In this sense, the national system responds to a growing movement since the days of July 2013 which is the expansion of participation beyond institutional mechanisms. Most, if not all, manifestations started from initiatives via social networks, so that participation could no longer be restricted to the traditional mechanisms of social participation. In this sense, the system aimed at the use of free software with the invitation of hackers (developers) and the inclusion of new digital instruments. The participa.br website was one of those initiatives of the government to approximate citizens who are not linked to formal institutions, but have effective participation, generating information and instruments of social control. 
 The system was also intended to deepen relations with social movements, supporting their initiatives and integrating them into institutional channels of social participation. In addition, the federal government would consolidate one of the most recent democratic innovations, which are the tables of dialogues between the entities with the federal government in order to stimulate the culture of social participation in Brazil. Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 The SNPS would consolidate a series of initiatives that have made Brazil a country with a high participatory propensity, but which are starting to show signs of possible limits. The system would be one of the alternatives to prevent the overlapping of decisions, the disarticulation between the participatory institutions themselves and with the other organs of government, besides trying to promote greater impact of the participatory decisions in the own political system. Although the system was not effectively implemented, it indicated possible solutions to these limits. Somehow, thinking about participation under the systemic bias is an inevitable path for participation in Brazil, which has been consolidated with diverse and different forms of participation, but which still generates little result in relation to the Brazilian political framework, and can be one of the hypotheses for the fall of the decree. 
 The decree did not create any new participatory institution, or control body, would only consolidate institutions that have been in force since the 1990s. Surprisingly, the SNPS was the subject of numerous criticisms and accusations not only from the National Congress but also from the mainstream media, which shows a failure in the very construction of social participation in Brazil. Despite having an expressive number of participatory institutions, a group of actors is unaware of its real meaning and function. Social participation is still restricted and does not reach the population at large. The idea of the system would be to integrate citizens who are not linked to participatory institutions and to try to make it more accessible to all. 
 Through the accusations of parliamentarians that the intention of the decree was to implant ""Bolivarianism"", ""communism"" and even ""absolutism"" in Brazil, was also evidenced a strong conservative bloc in Brazil that strongly rejects the idea of a deepening of the social participation. If, in the past, the impasse was to conquer the support of the federated entities for the adhesion to the system, what was really discussed was the political adhesion to the own national system of participation.

The solutions range from designing a machine to improving a social service. The methodology is broken into four steps: feel, imagine, do, and share - which, together, guide young participants in the fulfillment of their projects and the learning of each skill associated with the activities. The critical approach that makes this method so innovative is that the social change must come from the children, so although the mentors have a large responsibility in guiding them, they play more of a background role.  According to the Design for Change website, the framework they use offers a 30-hour design thinking curriculum that was created in collaboration with entities such as experts at Harvard, Stanford, and IDEO.[1] The theory behind the four step process is what drives the  deliberation , decisions, and public interaction through this method.  Origins and Development  The  Design for Change  FIDS model was developed by Kiran Bir Sethi who, according to the DFC website, “started this movement with a conviction that if young people were empowered and made to feel that they could take matters into their hands, they would change the world for the better. Kiran relied heavily on her background as an Industrial Designer to pilot the very first design-thinking guide for young people across India.”[2] Beginning in 2009, the organization began working with teachers and students in 30,000 schools in India. After a TED Talk by Bir Sethi went viral in 2010, the organization increased its scope of activity and now works in over 70 countries across the world.[3]  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Mentor registration is easy and quick; all that is required is a free online account, organization name, and project idea. Mentors are also trained for three hours in either  online  or live sessions. When beginning a project, mentors are prompted to create a project plan by selecting pre-made activities from the activity catalog that correspond with the four-step model. Different activities aim to achieve different skill objectives as they move through the process. The activity can be downloaded as a pdf lesson plan that contains recommendations for age and time needed as well as connections to educational standards linked to common core, objectives, a list of materials needed, and deliverables.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The table at the top of this page outlines the path taken in the student-focused design handbook for each of the FEEL, IMAGINE, DO, and SHARE themes as well as the skills embedded in lessons provided by the Design For Change website dashboard.[4]  The Feel stage is the crucial first step in “building character, capacity, and confidence as a problem solver.” The web portal guide nods to design thinking as a community-centered problem solving technique. This step emphasizes the importance of Change Makers ability to understand core issues, empathize, and continuously engage with their communities. Additional resources are provided on empathy in design thinking, empathy in the classroom, the power of motivation, and design thinking boot camp.[5]  The Imagine stage ""is essential to turning your learnings from empathetic exploration into possible solutions.” This stage focuses on building an atmosphere where Change Makers can feel free and motivated to brainstorm with unbridled creativity. It is during this step that the team will assess its skills and interests and the feasibility of their most innovative ideas. The web portal provides additional information on creativity or “Ideation” in design thinking and the power of convergent and divergent thinking.  The Do stage gives full implementation power to the students and promotes responsibility, accountability, and confidence. This is the step where they will begin turning ideas into action and persevere to see their goals achieved. Important lessons can be learned from this step, such as how to be resilient and how to recover and learn from failure.  Finally, the Share stage has teams reflect on the impact of their project and the learning process through the methodology. Teams abide by submission guidelines to ensure their stories are succinct and shareable. These videos are reviewed and compiled on the Design for Change YouTube Channel. Many times, they are used to supplement guidance on the web portals as well. Design for Change lauds this step as one of the most important because it inspires others, spreads the movement, and most importantly, validates all the hard work the children have put into the process.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  The application of these four steps is designed to train children to think about problem solving in an empathetic way that gets them out into the community.  Deliberation , decisions, and public interaction are required and are a natural progression through this method. An example of this in action can be seen through the project DCF2012 Singapore: Elderly Cleaners.[6] Students deliberated by brainstorming problems to tackle based on what they have observed in their communities. This team felt that elderly cleaners in their school were not respected for the hard work they do. Public participation happened early in the process when they designed a public poll (complete with a bookmark as an incentive!) and interviewed strangers in their community. They used their feedback to develop a poster campaign to raise awareness about the issue which also involved fundraising, a peer-quiz, public speaking, and mind-maps. Their project was successful and they could see attitudes changing for the better in their school.  Empathy is developed throughout the process. In that sense, the relationship between students and their mentor improves and matures along the process of change. The children feel heard and important; they feel the responsibility of working in groups in order to achieve a greater good. The same applies to the extended community that gets involved. Some parents often do not believe in the abilities of their children, but once they see what they have achieved, they change their minds. This method enables students to be more empowered and take decisions that affects them or their communities' lives. In other words, the result drives a change of mindset from the most skeptical stakeholders. Adults end up believing in the potential of the youth and give the children the space they need to impact their environment.  Additionally, it happens that children see what other groups are achieving through this method, and then they want to imitate the project, as well. So, the first group ends up leading an initiative that involves many actors within the school community, and even beyond (government, NGOs, IOs, and donors). Therefore, the implementation of the program moves beyond the limitations of a hierarchical decision-making process.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  According to the DFC organization,  “research conducted by The GoodWork Project has reaffirmed the impact of the DFC curriculum on the development of skills like collaboration, creative thinking &amp; empathy. [Ongoing research suggests] that the confidence developed through the project improves academic scores as well."" [7]  DFC's latest effort, the 8th grade curriculum, has the potential to expose students to important student development areas (empathetic thinking, problem-solving, confidence) in the context of DFC's principles. In order to ensure that the curriculum works for this purpose, The Good Project is currently assessing the impact of the 8th grade curriculum on students over the 2014-2015 school year.

In general, the top of this chain of command is occupied by a group of experts who base their decision on scientific or technical analysis. For this reason, the EU's 'Action plan on Science in Society related issues in Epidemics and Total pandemics' (ASSET) recommends that DAD is not suited to situations:""Where a wide range of technical, social, cultural and economic factors are influencing the current situation and the various possible alternatives to it  Where successful implementation involves a lot of people  Where these people are not in an obvious command structure, but can choose whether to cooperate"" [1]Origins and Development  While it is difficult to date the origins of the DAD method, The International Atomic Energy Agency gives several examples of public resistance to its use in relation to nuclear waste disposal. It would appear that DAD was used to determine the location of waste sites beginning in the 1980s. It is likely that DAD was used before this (possibly in other areas of public management) but the examples given by the IAEA demonstrate the public push-back that can result from such a top-down decision making process. [2]  Participant Recruitment and Selection  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The DAD approach is problematic for several reasons. As ASSET points out, ""in some contexts – traffic congestion, water supply, domestic energy use, waste reduction, renewable generation, flood risk management – the DAD approach is guaranteed to generate resistance to even the best ideas. Resistance eats up time and resources because it needs a response. The time spent overcoming resistance and defending the solutions against opponents often delays implementation and can lead to the plans being abandoned."" [1] In these cases it is recommended that a process of broad participatory decision-making and consultation of affected individuals be pursued. This avoids DAD becoming 'DADA' or ""Decide-Announce-Defend-Abandon.""  During a Lecture for the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Richard Susskind suggests the ""collaborative, adapitve, and management"" (CAM) process as an alternative process to the DAD approach. According to Susskind, ""collaborative means active involvement and transparency of all stakeholders or those affected by a particular development project. Adaptive is necessary when there is scepticism or difficulty arising from a particular project. Implementation in stages is better so that the parties responsible will have an in-depth understanding and will make improvements continuously. The management aspect needs to take the collaborative and adaptive approach. This means that improvement of the management system should be done in a collective and transparent way, with concerted effort of all parties."" [3]  See Also  References  [1] ASSET.

Participants are provided with collaging materials and pages of thematic icons representing the different federal public policy areas. The method is designed to spark dialogue among participants, encourage them to vote, demonstrate that political engagement can be fun and create space for individuals to reflect on the connection between important issues in their everyday life (food, shelter, health, education, etc.) and public policies.  Over the past two decades, voter turnout among young people has been steadily declining at all levels of government within Western democracies.[1] The National Roundtable on Youth Voter Engagement, reported that there is a strong need to “reinvigorate civic life by finding ways to make politics more relevant”.[2]  This tool offers a more appealing and accessible invitation into challenging discussions using art for social change (ASC) processes. ASC processes are designed to create insight and new connections between individuals and communities as they exchange stories, perspectives, knowledge and understanding through the creation of art. For example, by facilitating public art-making inspired by the election, Creative Publics Lab aimed to open up new spaces for political expression where ideas and perspectives could be explored through a creative, tactile activity. Targeted at the demographic of young Canadians notoriously disengaged from the formal electoral process, this method was used in an effort to provide young people new reflective spaces to express their perspectives on election issues and to engage the public in the election beyond just casting a vote at the ballot box.ObjectivesStimulate personal reflection on how public policy intersects with everyday life;  Facilitate interpersonal listening;  Generate political dialogue among strangers;  Address the lack of avenues for creative participation public policy discourse;  Allow for abstract ideas about policy to become more concrete through the art-making process;  Offer a non-formal and non-discursive forum for political expression;  Motivate political engagement in elections and other policy processes.Origins and Development  The method was first invented and used by the  Creative Publics Lab  in the Fall 2015 to engage voters in policy issues leading up to the Canadian federal election. The method was developed in reaction to declining voter turnout — particularly among youth — within Western democracies.[1] Canada is one such example where the retreat of young people from engagement with formal political institutions has been attributed to many factors — negative or cynical attitudes toward the performance of the politicians, time constraints, lack of interest or knowledge and inequitable values between young people and news outlets, to name a few.[3] The National Roundtable on Youth Voter Engagement, reported that there is a strong need to “reinvigorate civic life by finding ways to make politics more relevant”.[2] Based on this theory of change, this tool offered a more appealing and accessible invitation into challenging discussions using art for social change (ASC) processes.Participant Recruitment and Selection  The public policy collage interventions typically take place in busy public areas and as a result, attract a wide diversity of people who interact with each other as they make their collages. Significant effort is made to create an appealing atmosphere in an effort to attract a wide diversity of people. For instance, numerous chalkboard signs can be made inviting people to participate, artist facilitators can make themselves available for spontaneous conversations, and potential participants can be offered free coffee as they pass by the sites. This spontaneous interventionist approach of this tool serves to both bridge and bond social capital. It bridges social capital by bringing together people who otherwise may not encounter each other. The tool bonds social capital by attracting and reinforcing existing social ties within artist, academic, and activist communities who participate in the process.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The objective of using this method is to engage participants with public policy issues in a fun, creative and spontaneous way. This method draws on  participatory art  [4] and  pop-up democracy  — it facilitates the creation of artwork through temporary, site-specific practices that provide opportunities for increased local political participation. The act of art-making is used as a way to spark reflexive political dialogue among participants and public exhibit functions as a collective expression of creative political engagement.  The procedure includes recruiting participants as they pass through a busy public place by asking them if they would like to make a collage. Once they agree, participants are provided with collaging materials (a 4X6 piece of durable cardstock, scissors, glue, markers) and pages of thematic icons representing the applicable public policy areas (e.g. democratic reform, education, health care, human rights, national security).  The intended outcomes are to spark dialogue and interpersonal reflection among participants on political issues, encourage voting and political participation, and demonstrate that political engagement can be a creative activity.  Decisions regarding the focus areas and the aesthetic approach of the collages should be made in consultation with community residents prior to the execution of the process.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  The collages made by participants need to culminate in a public art installation exhibited in high traffic public spaces, ideally before a major political decision is being made (like an election). The installation functions both as an interactive exhibit — mirroring back how participants felt about political issues — and a bold reminder to participate in political institutions and processes.  Impact indicators:Number of direct face-to-face interactions (via community consultations, the activations, the public talks and installations);  Number of people who engaged through website and  social media  promotion;  Coverage in media outlets to grow awareness of the tool as a alternative to more formal political engagement processes;  Number of collages made;  Number of community partnership established through the course of the process;  Photo and video documentation of the activations;  Production of publications documenting and analyzing the method;  Research data (field notes, interviews, and written reflections from participants) that show if and how the process interrupted the patterns of everyday life and engage participants in political issues.Analysis and Lessons LearnedMobility : The collaging sites need to be able to move around the city, activating a variety of public spaces in different communities. The mobility of the collaging sites also work to increased connection across communities by linking neighbourhoods and creating partnerships with community organizations. Furthermore, being able to move the collaging sites to different locations provides a diversity of material to work with in the analysis phase.Accessibility and Inclusion : In order to create the conditions for dialogue amongst random members of the public the collaging site must be an inviting, relaxed and friendly environment. As such, the collaging must be low-barrier, only requiring that people know how to cut and glue paper and not requiring extensive knowledge of either art-making or politics. In this regard, the collaging iconography should be clear and help to clarify the values and issues that are most important to the participants.Adaptability : The collaging site should offer multiple entry points for engagement, allowing participants to choose their desired level of participation. For example, participants should be able to chose an alterntive to making a collage that requires less time (like writing or drawing a mesage to a decision-maker on a chalkboard).

 Problems and Purpose 
 The SWOT analysis or matrix is a structured planning method used by organizations (projects, business ventures) to assess four key elements: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. The ultimate goal of the analysis is to determine the 'strategic fit'; that is, the degree to which the internal environment of the organization conforms to its external surroundings. 
 According to the Work Group for Community Health and Development at the University of Kansas, the SWOT analysis can serve several purposes: Explore possibilities for new efforts or solutions to problems. 
 Make decisions about the best path for your initiative. Identifying your opportunities for success in context of threats to success can clarify directions and choices. 
 Determine where change is possible. If you are at a juncture or turning point, an inventory of your strengths and weaknesses can reveal priorities as well as possibilities. 
 Adjust and refine plans mid-course. A new opportunity might open wider avenues, while a new threat could close a path that once existed. Origins and Development Know how and why this tool/technique was developed? Help us complete this section!How it Works 
 The analysis is usually done by those within the organization so selection of participants depends on the hiring practices. Outside analysis may be sought but the method of participant selection would remain unaltered.

They take seriously Buckminster Fuller's important insight that ""you never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.""  Closely linked to ideas of  participatory art  and the commons, micro-utopias have manifested as small-scale prototypes for ‘do-it-ourselves’ temporary community centers, micro-libraries, free schools, food gardens, free stores, or digital platforms for collaborative political decision-making. They appear as artistic and political statements that result from interactions meant to provoke concrete political questions of the present. The purpose of micro-utopias is to stimulate public imagination by creating experiences in everyday life that bring an ethic of generosity, enjoyment and communalism. If well constructed, micro-utopias are spaces that people are attracted to, places that people want to visit, to live within, and to help create.  According to Stephen Duncombe, small-scale utopian projects should strive to:Inspire others by demonstrating another world is possible;  Critique the existing dynamics of our current society;  Generate new ideas for models for organizing society;  Orient toward a shared direction;  Motivate​ other toward collective and collaborative action. [2]Theory of ChangeThe theory of change behind micro-utopias is that if we offer a tangible glimpse or experience of a more desirable future, then people will be more likely to believe that such a future is possible and potentially participate in manifesting it. Further, if a critical mass of micro-utopias are created, then societies will be more capable of understanding and manifesting new societal structures, processes and relationships. Micro-utopias are by their nature temporary — they are not meant to be a definitive solution delivered by outsiders, but a model of what could be and a way to stimulate public imagination.  In her book  Utopia as Method: The Imaginary Reconstitution of Society , Ruth Levitas posits that the concept of utopia helps stimulate “holistic thinking about the connections between economic, social, existential and ecological processes in an integrated way” which can support the development of “alternative possible scenarios for the future and open these up to public debate and democratic decision — insisting always on the ... contingency of what we are able to imagine”.[3] By creating a different way of living and interacting, this approach also “entails refusal, the refusal to accept that what is given is enough”.[4] Micro-utopias thus function as a creative tool for defiance while also stimulating collective participatory prototyping and iteration.  Origins and Development  The concept of micro-utopias was originally proposed by curator Nicolas Bourriaud [5] to describe art projects that create temporary and small-scale convivial moments and experiments in interpersonal relations. Bourriaud was interested in utopia as a “device” to move away from the abstract and locate the concrete, political component of the micro-dimension of social life, the structures and flows of power that conform our everyday lives.[6] The concept of micro-utopia builds an approach to making art called “relational aesthetics” which Bourriaud defines as ""a set of artistic practices which take as their theoretical and practical point of departure the whole of human relations and their social context"".[7] This approach positions the artist as ‘facilitator’ or ‘catalyst and aims to offer a criteria to analyse the often opaque and open-ended works associated with participatory art.[8]  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Participant recruiment depends on the nature and goals of the specific project. Typically, micro-utopias reach out to a wide audience, opening up participation to anyone interested in being involved in addressing the topic or process being explored. However, micro-utopias can also be targted at a specific group or community of people. Micro-utopias can aim to engage participants either spontaneously for a brief interaction or in on ongoing way, if an intervention remains in one location over an extended period of time.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-MakingNetworked Micro-UtopiasSince the mid 1990s, the micro-utopia method has grown beyond art communities and been taken up by social movements that have combined the concept with  communication technology  in order to form ‘networked micro-utopias’ that use peer-to-peer digital media to test a concept or process that can be replicated or learned from. In his book  Designing for Micro‐utopias: Thinking Beyond the Possible , design scholar John Wood suggests an independent network of interconnected “micro-utopias”, or, as he says, “brief, local utopias”, offers a more feasible alternative to the search for one single “utopia”.[9] Networked micro-utopias were used most notably by the 15M Movement in Spain where a diversity of micro-utopias (such as popular assemblies, open wifi, guerilla theatre, public parties, free public transit, mobile applications to reach agreements and make collective decisions) were linked together and often coordinated.[10]  What micro-utopias may look like:'Free Stores' where all items are available at no cost;  Community Long Table potlucks where neighbourhood contributions of food produce an abundance;  Skill-share networks where participants can contribute their knowledge and learn new skills at no cost.Case Example: Gramsci Monument (July - September, 2013)The Gramsci Monument was a work by artist Thomas Hirschhorn that operated like a temporary community centre on the grounds of Forest Houses, a New York City Housing Authority development in the Morrisania neighborhood of the Bronx, New York. Named after the Italian thinker Antonio Gramsci, the project was interactive and collaborative in nature. The artist and the residents collaborated to build the temporary monument which included a library, an exhibition space, performance platform, workshop area, internet corner, lounge and bar, which were all run by local residents. The monument was an expansive installation constructed out of everyday materials like plywood, cardboard, duct tape, and aluminum foil. For the duration of the project, The Gramsci Monument was open daily, offering a daily program of lectures,  workshops , and open mic events coordinated by the community. A website provided live streaming and archives for documentation. The goal of the project was to establish a new term of monument, provoke encounters, create an event, and consider the relevance of Gramsci to today’s society.[11]  Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsKnow what outcomes and effects this method typically has?

Gadaa  is a holistic system of governance encompassing the political, social, cultural, economic and religious affairs of the Oromo people in Ethiopia.[2] As a system of governance, the Gadaa operates in stages (often ten stages with eight years separation).[3]  The power of the  Gadaa  general assembly is to exercise supreme legislative authority[4]. Its functions include (but are not limited to) reviewing laws at work, proclaiming new laws, impeaching the men in power, and settling major disputes that could not have been resolved at the lower levels of its judicial organ(s).[5][6] Any decision passed by the general assembly is final and cannot be reversed by any other assembly.[7] The legislative and adjudicatory supremacy of the general assembly is historically conditioned and culturally deep-rooted.  Origins and Development  Discourses around the origin of democracy contain a clear binary separation between ""us"" and ""them"" which over-simplifies the complex historical evolution of political systems.[8] In the majority of cases, ""us""/""we"" refer to the Occident/the West whose academics hold the ‘standard history of democracy’ to be a 'modernist', 'universalistic', epistemologically orthodox, single-trajectory event. The other category is “them”: the Orient/the Rest who provide a convenient counter-narrative, a ‘sub-standard story’ of relativistic, epistemologically unorthodox multiple-trajectories. Benjamin Isakhan warns that considering Western democracy as the only way for the rest of the world “miss[es] the broader human story of the struggle for and achievement of democracy.”[9] [a] Citing Roxanne (1997) Williams and Warren also suggest that, it is vital for political theorists to “problematize the dominance of Western intellectual traditions, conceptual frameworks, and institutional forms and devote our energies to fostering a ‘trans-cultural conversation’ or ‘dialogue among civilizations.”[10]  The place of Africa in the ""standard history"" of democracy is often overlooked. The conceptualisation of the postcolonial state in Africa is also highly influenced by the present predicaments (see: civil wars, famine, corruption and others) of the continent.[b] Hence, regard for African indigenous egalitarian institutions and its continuous development has little or no space in academic discussion. One such institution is the Gadaa system of the Oromo People. Some scholars underline that the  Gadaa  system of governance is genuinely African and provides a potential solution for some of the democratic crises we face today, be it in the global South or global North.[11] [To name a few, Abdulahi 1994; Asmarom 1973; 2006; Holcomb 1997; Marco 2005; Jalata 2012; Baxter 1978; Baissa 2004; Dirribi 2011; Hallpike 1976; and Alemayehu 2009.]  It is difficult to tell when exactly the  Gadaa  system began since is seens as an intrinsic element of the indigenous Oromo's everyday lives and not an 'institution'. However, counting back the Gadaa leaders in power, now at its 71st Gadaa leader and multiplying it by eight years, one can reasonably conclude it has been practised since at least the early 1400s.[12] Moreover, gathering under a sycamore tree known as  Odaa  is part of traditional Oromo culture. Today, the sycamore tree is a symbolic representation of dialogue and consensus, where the local community comes together to make new rules and resolve disputes.[13] Given the vastness of the Oromia (363,136 square kilometres) and its population (50 million), assemblies take place in several places and assemblies are named after the place of gatherings.[14] For instance, among the Borana-Oromo it is known as  Gumi-gayo (Gumi  means assembly and  Gayo  refers to a place of water well); among the central Oromo it is called as  Chaffe  (meaning, assembly at the edge of prairie grass); among the Guji-Oromo it is known as Yaa’ii Me’ee-Bokuu ( Yaa ́ii  means multitude and  Me’ee-Boku  refers to the place).[15]  Participant Recruitment and Selection  In principle, every person can attend the  Gadaa  general assembly. Differences in terms of age, status or political affiliation may not bar a person from taking part in the assembly.[16] However, it is mandatory for all living former  Abba Gadaas  (presidents), former and incumbent  Gadaa  Councilors (not less than thirty in number), and clan elders to convene to the assembly.[17] The assembly was led by a speaker - ex- Abba Gadaa .[18] In a new development, women were allowed to attend the general meeting - something previously not permitted for them.[19] Sirna hopes that it is inevitable that women continue to participate and deliberate in Gadaa general assembly.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Again, the Gadaa system is an indigenous egalitarian democratic system practiced among the Oromo nation. The Gadaa General Assembly takes place under a sycamore tree - a symbolic representation of dialogue and consensus.[20]  A holistic system of governance, the Gadaa operates in stages (often ten stages with eight years separation).[21] Unlike other Western democratic systems, the Gadaa system has five permanent political parties whose members assume leadership once every eight years.[22] Within forty years, all five parties serve their nation constituting 'One Gadaa'.[23]  The power of the  Gadaa  general assembly is to exercise supreme legislative authority. Its functions include (but are not limited to) reviewing laws at work, proclaiming new laws, impeaching the men in power, and settling major disputes that could not have been resolved at the lower levels of its judicial organ(s).[24][25] Any decision passed by the general assembly is final and cannot be reversed by any other assembly.[26]  Historically, the process of enacting laws by the general assembly across central Oromo was quite different, especially before the mid-19th century. The process is dramatic[c], beginning with the Gadaa leader climbing to the top of a large stone from which he jumps down solemnly, shouting "" serri bu'e""  meaning “the law has fallen!”[27] De Salviac explains this dramatization as “an expedient of infantile simplicity but by its nature it is basically to make deep impression of the open imagination of the crowd.""[28] Hence it creates the sense of imagining people without law, order and closure of government where an offender goes unpunished and all other laws will be null and void. Following the dramatic expression the assembly reclaims the law by shouting “the law! The law! We want the law!"" Eventually, the president climbs up on the rock again and responds to the swelling assembly stating "" serri ba'e""  meaning the law is raised! Following this event all participants burst into joy.[29]General ProcedureNowadays, among the Guji-Oromo, the adoption of any laws by the  Gadaa  general assembly follows a strict procedure starting with the speaker (ex- Abba Gadaa ) opening the agenda for deliberation by all. Then, discussion on the proposed agenda takes place in a traditional and orderly manner which privileges those with seniority.[30] Following this, the speaker of recounts the proposed agenda and the main points of discussion.[31] Finally, upon completion of the series of deliberations he asks: “would there be anything but peace if we said `these are our laws'?"" and the assembly responds unanimously.[32]  The speaker requires every assemblyman to take part in the  Gadaa  general assembly calmly and actively engage in the  deliberation .[33] In the middle of the deliberations he intervenes to make sure that a topic is meant to be in the meeting for discussion rather than debate.[34] Above all, he holds that the assembly is not the place of showing one’s talent of speech or a place to judge a speaker's mind but it is the place for seeking solutions to societal problems.[35] Hence, he seeks to balance the individual freedom of expression on the one hand, and the orderly environment of deliberation on the other.[36]  Following this, the speaker opens the space for all participants, in particular for the  Gadaa  councillors, to deliberate on agendas encompassing environmental, social, political, and cultural matters. Then, the next speaker says  kophise ! (meaning, the chance is mine!). The person who says “ kophise !” ahead of others is accorded the first chance to speak.[d] Each speaker is required to repeat the fundamental moral values before proceeding to the discussion before voicing their opinion on the issue. When finished, the speaker says  toggise ! (meaning, I am done!) and the next person who wants to deliberate says  qophise ! and continues to speak. Each speaker may support or oppose the view of their predecessor and, in doing so, the views of the minority are eventually swallowed by the majority consensually.[37]  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  In its current political context, the  Gadaa  system is relegated to local-level practices.[38] The past regimes as well as the current government are responsible for the demotion and underdevelopment of the  Gadaa  system. Even though UNESCO recently recognized  Gadaa  system as intangible cultural heritage, it is not given any official recognition by national or regional constitutions.[39] Instead,  Gadaa  functions parallel to the state political institutions.[40]  It is perhaps ironic that although the  Gadaa  system has functioned as an effective method of participatory democracy for the past six centuries, the Ethiopian national government is mired in tyranny and corruption.[41] This is a possible indication that democracy is sustainable where it is socially and culturally grounded, and not simply self-proclaimed democratic republicanism. For instance, Ethiopia had a constitution since 1931 and has never become a democratic state in practice.[42] Nevertheless, politicians and citizens of Ethiopia recognize that  Gadaa  is democratic, and often the federal and Oromia Regional State presidents attend the  Gadaa  power transfer ceremonies; there, they read their written confessions and appreciate how  Gadaa  system is uniquely an African egalitarian and democratic system. Yet, they do not have a vision to accommodate it or even to learn from  Gadaa  participatory democracy.[43] On the bright side, however, the enthusiasm and participation of the Oromo youth has been increasing tremendously.  Analysis and Lessons LearnedTimeAmong the Guji-Oromo the general assembly takes place once every eight years and mostly for a week, just a week before power transfer.[44] However, among the Borana-Oromo, the general assembly takes place once every eight times in the middle of the term of office of a leader.[45] In the case of the former, it is very crucial, to attract the attention of the participants since it also marks power transfer and in the case of the latter it is important since it checks the responsibility of the leaders in power. Since, power transfer takes place elsewhere following elections, it would be interesting to see people gather and deliberate on the future of their country, not just before elections but just before power transfers.StructureGadaa  has five parties of at least six Councillors each - four from past administrations and one from the incumbent.[46] In total there are 30 Councillors with very rich experiences who together shape the success of the deliberation.[47] The other most important thing is that the ‘past, present, and future’ are in the assembly. In contemporary political systems, elections are conducted every four or five years and citizens often pay little attention to matters of government. According to Sirna, citizen apathy is at the root of the modern political system's crisis. A lesson from  Gadaa  shows the value of the past, since future possible leaders are included in the assembly to learn from their superiors.[48] Each  Gadaa  represents a kind of 'grading' of the candidates who take part in the assembly - representing the ""future"". Women also take part in the assembly but do not deliberate - they arrive at the assembly last and leave first - last in, first out!Consensus through dialogue   As discussed above, whoever asks for the chance to speak first is granted the ability and the deliberation does not come to a close until all ideas and voices have been heard.[49] In other words, until a ""consensus"" is reached, the deliberation continues.[50] No one interrupts while someone is speaking, a speaker need not stand to speak, and once they have spoken they may speak again. Dialogue is thus based on respect - in recognition of one another’s views - proceeding from the iteration of ‘the general moral values’ and continuing on to agree with the previous speaker's words or respectfully deviating and voicing one's own opinion.[51] The only thing that gains automatic consensus are ideas that are close to the commonly accepted moral values.

In most instances, each participant is given a wireless keypad or mobile device which allow them to communicate an answer to a receiver (a base station or, a cloud/software depending on the wire setup).  Audience response systems have become common methods of preference articulation in large group meetings and deliberations such as  21st Century Town Meetings  ARS allows presenters to ask a question to the room and to gather immediate feedback in a short amount of time which can then be instantly displayed on a screen or recorded in real time. Serial numbers on the remotes allow organizers – but not other participants – to identify individual voters.[1]  Origins and Development  According to Wikipedia, audience response systems have been in use since the 1950s especially in the field of advertising and marketing.[1] The use of ASR in a deliberative context is perhaps most easily traced back to  AmericaSpeaks  ’  21st Century Town Meetings  which began in the mid 1990s and continue on as a method of participatory democracy.

For example,  21st Century Town Meetings  often takes advantage of this technology but the selection of participants depends on the topic and goal of the organizers. The DC Citizen Summits were open to all while the DC Youth Summit specifically recruited those between the ages of 14 and 21.  The use of networked computers or electronic polling devices record the ideas developed either in groups or individually.  According to Moynihan, the use of ASR during the  DC Citizen Summits  fostered discussion and consensus among the individuals in each group about the messages to be entered into the computer.""[3] As well, the recording of serial numbers means data can be used at both the aggregate and individual-level which allows results to be cross referenced with participant demographics. It is thus possible for organizers to identify clusters of preferences among groups or individuals and so move deliberations in a consensus focused direction.[2]  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  The “polling keypads allowed citizens to rank preferences, which facilitated an iterative consideration and prioritization of specific policy trade-offs and preferences”.[3]  Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this method?

It enables efficient collecting, analyzing and visualization of map-based data. It is easy to make a Maptionnaire survey - and even easier to respond. With Maptionnaire’s browser tool, analysis and visualizations are easy to perform and share. The data can also be downloaded in formats supported by all major GIS software.  Not long ago, the creation and analysis of map-based questionnaires required considerable technological expertise. Maptionnaire allows the locality-based study of human experiences and the transfer of this knowledge into academic research and urban planning processes by anyone and just using a web browser.  The main user groups of the service comprise of research institutions, public agencies, consultancies and community engagement projects. Location matters, whether the aim is to study suburban youth, business traveling, real-estate management, infrastructure projects, hiking in national parks, or shopping experiences.  Origins and Development  The Maptionnaire service has evolved from the environmental psychology grounded SoftGIS methodology developed at Aalto University since 2005. Research themes studied with this methodology include for example environmental child-friendliness, perceived urban safety and accessibility of ecosystem services. The SoftGIS approach studies human behavior, but zooms closer into where exactly the experiences take place. Later on, SoftGIS developed into Maptionnaire, a commercialized service that allows anyone without any coding or GIS skills to create surveys and collect and analyze data.  How it Works  Maptionnaire works via a survey-specific URL. It can be disseminated to an unlimited and unspecified group of participants (e.g. via social media) or be made available only to a pre-selected group of participants.  Using the software, organizations, individuals and public officials can design surveys in order to collect map-based data. In effect, the survey may ask relatively open ended questions like ""what neighbourhood improvements would you like?"" Participants - in this case the residents of the neighbourhood - respond to the survey question with both a text-based answer and a GPS data-point. The process of consultation is thus streamlined: the survey-organizer gets two pieces of information while the respondent only has to answer one survey. Thanks to the built-in location recording software, respondents can focus on describing what's important (ie. what needs to be done) rather than where the problem is.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Maptionnaire surveys make new, relevant and important information on resident priorities available for local governments and other organizations. The integration of a geographic location to the responses from people elevates the value of the user input and enables efficient analyses and visualizations.  In the public service context, the use of Maptionnaire helps make planning processes and interaction with residents and other stakeholders smoother and more efficient, ultimately resulting in well-informed decision-making.  In academic research, Maptionnaire surveys help investigate place-specific human experiences to gather people-produced qualitative spatial data, e.g. active living environments or where one feels safe and where not.  So far, Maptionnaire has been used in numerous cities all over the world and appears to have been successful. It has been adopted by different entities including municipal authorities in Finland, an academic institution in Australia, and a community-based organization in Mauritius. Academic analysis of the tool's efficacy compared to other online participation and public feedback software has yet to be performed.

The process empowers locals by including them directly in the issue identification and evaluation process and, in many cases, in the final implementation and post-construction monitoring. The concept of PRA has evolved overtime since, as Narayanasamy notes, “as a development tool, it cannot just stop with committing the people in appraising and analysis their problems...rather, it must go beyond that and extend into analysis, planning and action.”[1] Subsequently, PRA has become known as Participatory Learning and Action. In Pakistan, it is known as  Participatory Reflection and Action , a term which is now used more widely.  Many development organizations face the ‘local knowledge problem’: the inability to understand or identify the full scope of local needs without communicating with residents. Participatory rural appraisal allows organizers to overcome this problem by including residents directly in the issue identification and evaluation process.  Origins and Development  In his seminal article on participatory rural appraisal, Robert Chambers traces the method’s evolution from various sources dating back to the 1960s. Among its antecedents are activist participatory research (circa 1968), agroecosystem analysis (circa 1978), applied anthropology (circa 1979), field research on farming systems (circa 1960), and rapid rural appraisal (circa late 1970s).[2] Rapid rural appraisal is perhaps PRA’s closest relative but was deficient in the ‘participatory’ aspect until the word entered the field’s vocabulary in the mid-1980s.[3] While RRA was developed in universities, applied in a top-down fashion and had as its objective “learning by outsiders”, PRA grew out of NGO field work, is carried out using various modes of participatory and has as its goal the “empowerment of local people.”[4]The transition from RRA to PRA and now to an even more participatory form can largely be seen in Narayanasamy’s observation that “as a development tool, [rural appraisal] cannot just stop with committing the people in appraising and analysis their problems...rather, it must go beyond that and extend into analysis, planning and action.”[5] While RRA initially undervalued the knowledge held by locals, early forms of PRA undervalued their analytical capabilities. Recent adaptations of the model have thus become more participatory and empowering by entrusting locals with the assessment, analysis and, in some cases, the execution and post-construction management of rural development projects.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  The selection of participants depends on the scope of the project and the decision of the organizers. There are numerous participatory tools and methodologies available to organizers which means that the types of participants and the stages of participation will vary widely. For example, both RRA and PRA have been known to use ‘key informants’ which involves “enquiring who are the experts and seeking them out, sometimes through participatory social mapping.”[6] The use of the word ‘sometimes’ implies that organizers may either rely on their own resources to find experts (most common in RRA) or on the knowledge and resources of the locals (most common in PRA). The selection of participants and, in fact, the degree of empowerment granted to participants thus varies.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  According to Luigi Cavestro, PRA is primarily a process of problem solving wherein the local residents are given agency over the identification of the problem, the creation of a solution, and (in some cases), the final project implementation and post-construction monitoring. The eight steps generally followed in this process are:Rapport formation [between facilitator/organizer and locals]  Understanding [the problem from the local’s perspective]  Reframing [the problem in a way that makes its management possible]  Solution searching [which, at this point, means narrowing down the numerous possible solutions to a general type of solution]  Solution planning and development [which, after agreeing on a type of solution, involves further specification of the solution and agreements on the roles of various actors in its realization]  Implementation [wherein the facilitator/organizer is to “help people with their motivation, focus and persistence”[7]]  Evaluation and adjustment [happens when the project is complete or an impasse has been reached. Adjustment can be extreme – abandoning the current approach – or a refinement of result – “creating new problems to fine-tun[e] a minor aspect”[8]]  Ending and consolidation [during which it is up to facilitator/organizer to ensure that residents have the ability to apply the newly acquired problem solving skills in the same or similar problems if they should emerge or re-emerge]There are numerous tools and methods of participation employed in service of participatory rural appraisal, the following list of which has been adapted from Chamber’s original paper.Secondary sources such as files, reports, maps, aerial photographs, satellite imagery, articles and books  Semi-structured interviews can entail having a mental or written checklist, but being open-ended and following upon the unexpected; they are increasingly using participatory visual as well as traditional verbal methods  Key informants: inquiring who are the experts and seeking them out, sometimes through participatory social mapping; Groups of various kinds (casual; specialist/focus; deliberately structured; community/neighbourhood).  Group interviews and activities are part of many of the methods  Do-it-yourself: asking to be taught, being taught, and performing village tasks, such as transplanting, weeding, ploughing, field-levelling, mudding huts, drawing water, collecting wood, washing clothes, stitching, thatching, etc.  They do it: villagers and village residents as investigators and researchers - women, poor people, school teachers, volunteers, students, farmers, village specialists. They do transects, observe, interview other villagers, analyse data, and present the results. This is a widespread element in PRA.  Participatory analysis of secondary sources.  Participatory  mapping  and modelling, in which local people use the ground, floor or paper to make social, demographic, health, natural resource, service and opportunity, or farm maps, or they construct three-dimensional models of their land transect walks by walking with or by local people through an area, observing, asking, listening, discussing, identifying, seeking problems, solutions and opportunities; and mapping and diagramming the zones, resources and findings  Time lines as well as trend and change analysis  Oral histories and ethno biographies  Seasonal calendars  Daily time use analysis indicating relative amounts of time, degrees of drudgery of activities, sometimes indicating seasonal variations;  Livelihood analysis, of factors such as: stability, crises and coping, relative income, expenditure, credit and debt, multiple activities, often by month or season  Participatory linkage diagramming  Institutional or ""Chapati"" or Venn diagramming - identifying individuals and institutions important in and for a community, or within an organisation, and their relationships  Well-being and wealth grouping and ranking often leading to the identification of key indicators of well-being.  Analysis of difference, especially by gender, social group, wealth/poverty, occupation and age. Identifying differences between groups, including their problems and preferences [which] includes contrast comparisons  Matrix scoring and ranking ( SWOT )  Estimates and quantification, often using local measures, judgements and materials  Probes of questions which can lead directly to key issues  Stories, portraits, and case studies such as a household history and profile, coping with a crisis, how a conflict was or was not resolved  Team contracts and interactions  Presentation and analysis - where maps, models, diagrams, and findings are presented by local people, or by outsiders, and checked, corrected and discussed;  Sequences: the use of methods in sequence - for example participatory social mapping leading to the identification of key informants or analysts  Participatory planning,  budgeting , implementation and monitoring  Group discussions and brainstorming, by local people alone, by  focus groups  of local people, by local people and outsiders together, or by outsiders alone  Short standard schedules or protocols either for very short and quick  questionnaires , or to record data (e.g., census information from social mapping) in a standard and commensurable manner  Report writingWhile the methods and tools of RRA overlap with those of PRA, the following usage trends have been observed by Chambers: “all the methods can be used in both RRA and PRA, but some are more emphasized in one than the other. RRA has tended to stress the use of secondary sources, verbal interaction especially through semi-structured interviewing, and observation: so these are sometimes described as ‘RRA methods’. For its part, a distinctive aspect of PRA has been the shared visual representations and analysis by local people, such as mapping or modeling on the ground or paper; estimating, scoring and ranking with seeds, stones, sticks or shapes; Venn diagramming; free listing and card sorting; linkage diagramming; and presentations for checking and validation: so these are often described as ‘PRA methods.’”[9]  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  There are many examples of PRA’s practical application, mostly in underdeveloped nations. Included among the development projects which used PRA are: natural resource management, agriculture, poverty and social programs, and health and food security.[10]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The success of each process of PRA largely depends on the tools and methods used as well as the organizers’ commitment to the ‘participatory’ aspect of the practice. Chambers, writing in 1994, notes that few academic analyses of PRA were available but that, from those at hand, most experiences were positive. As well, Chambers points to an analysis of an agricultural development project in Kenya which“showed that performance had been worst in a showcase catchment where the approach had not been participatory [whereas t]he impact indicators were generally higher where catchment committees were freely elected, and where farmers had participated in planning and layout, and they were consistently best in the catchment where the program had begun with an interdepartmental PRA.”[11]Chambers concludes that the use of PRA in development is successful because it recognizes and utilizes “the richness not just of the knowledge of villagers, but of their creative and analytical capabilities.”[12]  It should be noted that Chambers cautions against taking ‘participatory’ development projects at face value since “as PRA becomes ""politically correct,"" so reports of PRA are likely to be inflated.” Old theories and practices of development which saw and treated locals as “incapable poor people” are, unfortunately, ingrained in the structure of international development work and thus the use of PRA should be carefully evaluated, especially regarding the agency locals had over the process.

For example, in  Egypt ,  community committees liaise between residents  and the  Community Development Association  whereas in South Africa, community (ward) committees liaise between residents and the municipal government. Community committees differ from neighbourhood associations although the two may overlap in certain geographical or cultural contexts. Benjamin Reed distinguishes between grassroots and ‘straddler’ organizations, the latter of which is “linked to the state rather than independent of it”.[1] ‘Straddler’ organizations are more common outside of North America and are thus similar to community committees especially in the Egyptian and South African contexts discussed below.  In general, community committees are established as a means of increasing the representation and participation of residents in the political decision-making process. The degree of empowerment allocated to the community and their representatives in the committee is analogous to their place in this process. Most often, the committee is involved in the identification of locally-specific problems which then inform higher-level decisions. However, in some cases, the committees are also entrusted with the collaborative or independent (i.e. with or without their governing superiors) development, implementation and/or post-execution monitoring of solutions. Community committees may be established as part of a  participatory rural appraisal  project since they are an effective means by which to communicate with residents, to oversee a process of capacity building and self-management, and to encourage participation in the identification and resolution of various problems.  Origins and Development  Because they are commonly established through grassroots efforts, community committees most likely have their roots in the earliest establishment of representative government. The delegation of power to high authorities often creates a sense of disconnect between what the voter thinks or wants and what their representatives in government do. Committees are an obvious means by which to narrow or ‘straddle’ this state-society division.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  The selection of participants depends entirely on the structure, scope and goals of the community committee. Those committees who ‘straddle’ the line between state and society are often forced to comply with various standards including the selection of representatives. In South Africa, the speaker of the committee who oversees the election of 10-15 nominees is appointed by the municipal government. More grassroots committees may not be as strict in their selection although usually some process of voting or term rotation will be followed. In Egypt, community committees were established by a development NGO to  increase local participation in the development process  led by  Community Development Associations . Members of the committee were elected from a group of individuals identified during a  participatory rural appraisal process .  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Like any group representing the interests of a wider body, community committees generally use various methods and tools to mediate between the state and society.  Public hearings  or meetings are commonly used to gather feedback from residents and to pass on information from the government. Like the selection committee members, the structure and scheduling of public meetings is often mandated by the committee’s superiors in government.  In Egypt, an NGO, San Mark,  established a community committee  to ‘straddle’ the gap between residents and the local  Community Development Association . Through public meetings, awareness-raising seminars, and  focus group discussions , the committee allowed community members to vocalize their needs and participate in the development process. As well, elected committee members “conducted periodical and continuous field visits to monitor activities to determine whether the project implementation was effective.”[2] The committee encouraged residents to take a leading role in some of the development projects like neighbourhood waste disposal.  South African ward committees function in a similar many to the community committees in Egypt. According to the national government, ward committees:“create formal unbiased communication channels and co-operative partnerships between the municipality and the community within a ward  ensure contact between the municipality and the community through the use and payment of services  create harmonious relationships between the residents of a ward, ward councillor, geographically diverse community and the municipality  facilitate public participation in the process of managing the development, review, and implementation of the municipality’s IDP  act as an advisory body on council policies and matters affecting communities in the ward  monitor the implementation of ward plans, programmes and ward discretionary funds (note that control of funds and implementation rests with council)  coordinate ward programmes.”[3]Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  In general, community committees increase the level of residential participation in development and management. Depending on their structure and the methods and tools used to engage with the public, community committees can be an effective way of increasing the say locals have in or over municipal government decisions. According to the South African government, ward (community) committees “giv[e] meaning to the notion of ‘the people shall govern’...because local government is regarded as the level of government closest to the people and ward [community] committees are just one way to ensure that citizens give input in the decisions that local councils make.”[4] Community committees in Egypt have had a similar result; by increasing the level of local participation, the  Community Development Associations  have become more accountable and transparent in their dealing with residents. As well, community capacity building has been an immediate result of the committees’ establishment. Citizens not only have a voice in higher-level decision-making but they are more involved in the direct management and oversight of their neighbourhoods’ development.[5]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Problems around community committees may include:Unequal representation  Lack of transparency  Unequal participation or outreach (eg. to socially marginalized individuals)  Inflexible meeting times[6]  Lack of funding  Lack of autonomy (from the state or other interests)Have a better analysis of community committees?

 According to Co-operatives UK, businesses, groups or organizations which embrace the co-operative model ""are run not by institutional investors or distant shareholders, but by their members."" The co-operative method of business management is modelled after participatory democracy: depending on their size, co-operative members not only vote for their board members or representatives but directly participate in the management and decision-making process of the business.  [1]Co-operatives grew out of socialist thought which sees the worker as increasingly abstracted and removed from the products of their work. In contrast, ""as businesses owned and run by their members, co-operatives offer a solution to the growing sense of powerlessness people feel over business and the economy, giving them control of the businesses they are closest to - whether they shop at them, work at them or supply them.""

 According to the Ontario-based non-profit People for Education, ""school councils provide advice to the principal and school board. Every school must have a school council, and members include parents, the principal, a teacher, a student (in high schools), a non-teaching staff member and a community representative.

As well, BarCamps require that each participant give a presentation although these are meant to be conversational in tone. BarCamps are unique in that they heavily encourage participants to speak or post (online) publicly about the experience and information presented or discussed. While the BarCamp may only be attended by a fixed number of participants, the knowledge exchanged therein is made public to encourage ongoing dialogue.

However, social media's ability to disseminate information and engage a wide audience has also lead to some of the largest instances of pubic participation such as the Arab Spring and Occupy Wallstreet. Social media is therefore a powerful tool for use by both organized and decentralized participatory initiatives and movements.[2]  A case can be made for the exclusion of web-based hosted platforms or designed networking models to facilitate deliberation as not appropriate for this thread- Hosted platforms like PlanIt, Citizinvestor, and NextDoor can have design implications on  deliberation [3] on geographic proximity or localization on a neighborhood or city-wide scale,[4] even help develop cultural practices based on norms of engagement facilitated by design features.[5] Elements of the following social media concepts may also be present on hosted platforms, but the nature of their engagement, scale, and networked presence is not the same as more commonly considered social media platforms.[6] Based on the general use of the term “Social Media” on Participedia, the term either explicitly or implicitly refers to Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram, among other global platforms.  Deliberative ideals match the capacity of social media platforms in a variety of ways. Citizens can gain a multitude of perspectives of information,[7][8] government entities can demonstrate transparency[6] and the public can be engaged in large-scale discussions.[3] However, social media platforms can also be found incomplete, lack adoption, or not yet realize these deliberative ideals in a variety of ways. Three common themes that arise in the use of social media for public engagement include the expressions of citizenship, the perpetuation of misinformation, and the nature of transactional, or “one-way” engagement.Expressions of CitizenshipWe must ask “What is the role of digital and social media to give visibility and voice to expressions of citizenship?”[9] Access to social media and the proper networks of information can be inclusive for those properly connected, and potentially further disenfranchise disconnected citizens.[9] Expressions of perspectives and engagement online can be reinterpreted or misinterpreted by governing agencies, creating a sense of ‘pseudo-participation’ and constraining the techno-political sphere of managed cyberspace. [10][11][12] Inclusion of perspectives, when done poorly, can reinforce citizens distrust in a public process and the credibility of institutions.[9]Perpetuating MisinformationNoting that communication is a shaper of public opinion[13] we must be wary of heavy consumers of media distorting society to fit their views being consumed.[9] “Framing” and “Priming” are two means of presentation that can perpetuate misinformation on the part of producers, undermining the effectiveness of social media and other digital tools to strengthen public engagement.[6] Misinformation erodes one of the core tenets that must be present for deliberation and the use of social media both, trust in the information and the process.[14]Transactional EngagementA lack of influence on policy or a long-term feedback loop [15] matches a transactional perspective that can be held by some government agencies using social media for public engagement and deliberation.[6] Lacking “two-way” communication impacts the nature of discussion on different platforms [16] and failure of recognition can lead citizens to blame the process rather than the technological tools.[6]  Origins and Development  Communication scholars have long recognized the potential for the internet, and subsequently social media, to impact  deliberation  and public engagement. Initial means of public engagement consisted of local forums,[17] email transactions, and web sites to enhance the communicative capacity and information sharing seen as a regular part of municipal governance.[6][18] Social media platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter have gained prominence in many nations around the globe since 2005, contributing to deliberative discussions and civic engagements like the Arab Spring, Gezi Park,  Brexit , and most recently the 2016 United States Presidential Election.[4][14][16]  How it Works  Who might be the typical user of a social media platform, and what is their level of engagement? Moss and Coleman (2014) propose four types of citizens in this regard: the deliberative citizen, who engages in discussion forums; the monitorial citizen, who evaluates policies and services, the single-click citizen, who promotes and signs  petitions ; and the citizen who represents the collective wisdom of  crowdsourcing .[9]. It is important to understand how citizens are reached, be they the “usual suspects” who may drown out other voices[6] or well networked individuals with social capital.[8] For deliberative ideals of inclusion and equal opportunity to participate, social media must be evaluated and utilized to provide a voice for those marginalized or lacking capacity for other means of engagement.[7][16]  Citizens have the opportunity to be both the consumers, and producers of information and deliberative perspectives due to social media [6][9] with an approach called “informational engagement”. This develops through a relational orientation among citizens and organizing institutions, rather than using social media for information distribution. Active participation is not just a matter of frequency of engagement or decision-making based on public  surveys , rather that citizens see the results of online engagement embody their suggestions, demonstrate recognition of their contribution,[6] and develop social presence with citizens as afforded through persistent presence and pervasive awareness.[8] Persistent presence is the technological affordance of a static and developed online persona, identity, or networked relationships that evolve as citizens communicate peer-to-network and not just peer-to-peer. Pervasive awareness is the capacity for citizens to monitor, and have the expectation to investigate, metrics on any number of public elements. Challenges of pervasive awareness include the flattening of contexts, such that important or critical messages may be delivered via the same medium as a more personal message about mundane elements of a friend or colleague.[8][19] Certain platforms that do not emphasize an identity connection to the online conversation also run the risk of perpetuating more judgmental or opinionated information, lower critical investigation of messages by citizens, and a higher likelihood of ideological polarization around sensitive topics.[16]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The influence of social media on public opinion and deliberative democracy has perhaps never been more top of mind in a global way as it has been recently with the revelations of psychographic profiling. The demonstrable and quantifiable impact of this new work has yet to be evaluated in an academic capacity, but two converging principles demonstrate the influence, outcomes, and effects of social media and provide insight on the likely conclusions to come from recent revelations. Deliberative democracy depends on trust by those engaged that the process will be fair and equitable, [19][20] and social media usage can both perpetuate issues of trust and resolve them. In practical study, one of the strongest ways that social media engagement empowers citizens and crystallizes messaging is through the combination of  online discussions  and offline, in-person engagement. [9][21][8][22][12]Social Trust and System TrustAccording to Wang and Emurian (2005), social trust is the faith invested in a party for their propensity to abide by the best interest of the trusting party, and this found to be highly dependent on social identification and connection to social groups or organizations. System trust is the faith vested in technological systems and Information Communication Technologies (ICT’s) based on the affordances they provide. Use and familiarity with a system contribute to users building trust in that technological system.[14] System trust, especially technological affordances that can improve immediacy or engagement with users in a manner that is recognizable confers a measure of credibility onto the person or organization with these affordances,[14] like an activist group with a heavy presence on Facebook or twitter. Self-categorization on social media leads to depersonalization of self-perception, lending users to more easily confer trust in social identities or systems with more alignment to one’s own feelings and behaviors, similar to in-group and out-group differentiation.[14][23] One of the most validating actions for social trust and system trust as found by Haciyakupoglu and Zheng (2015) is in-person experience that lends credibility to the perspective of the social identity, or in-person experience that corroborates information shared across a system.[14] In lieu of such in-person experiences, video footage has been found to have a high capacity for instilling trust due to the difficulty in fabrication and the viewpoint being similar to in-person perspectives.The Need for In-Person EngagementOther research has shown a connection between social media use and in-person engagement as resulting in more substantive information exchange. Findings from social media use by local councils in Leeds, UK identify the real challenge for creating meaningful engagement to be the use of social media to facilitate civic “connective actions” [24] enabled by a digital civic place.[9] In-person engagement can verify and validate information exchanged on social media networks as well as foster authentic dialogue by providing more contextual cues than social media might allow,[16] and this authenticity is especially sought after in areas where government intervention in social media is high.[14][12] Hybrid uses of social media and in-person engagement simultaneously can make sharing perspectives easier, co-learning information more robust, and ground perspectives in-situ while providing an overlay of proposed ideas or complementary technical information.[21]ConclusionIn many ways, the initial predictions of how social media would revolutionize deliberation and public engagement have yet to bear out. Issues of misinformation, social identity, in-group alignment, trust, transparency, and authoritative control over the use of social media and  ICT’s  commonly present modern challenges for global platforms like Facebook and Twitter, as well as web-based and locally oriented online networks. However, when used to augment deliberation practices and community engagement, social media has found a number of successful roles to play.[22] Citizens can mobilize, confer with different perspectives on an issue easily[6][17]; vet reliability of information with first-hand and in-person accounts[14]; bring authoritative and technical information to bear during discussions to lower impediments to engagement[16]; and create more robust co-learning opportunities.[15][12] These perspectives and scholarship demonstrate that social media can and should be used to foster relational, two-way conversations among citizens[8] and that social media should compliment or catalyze concurrent in-person engagement.[9][12] Practically, we have seen this mobilization happen with the #metoo movement and #marchforourlives. Reflective consideration of the strengths and shortcomings of social media in public engagement will also help to further evolve the public awareness of our online identities, the role and connection these identities play in creating and connecting our public opinions, and likely embed social media as an innovative facet of deliberative democracy and public engagement going forward.

 Problems and Purpose 
 Liquid democracy is a decentralized method of governance and would not be possible on a large-scale without the connective power of the internet. Adhocracy, like  LiquidFeedback  , was designed to give community engagement leaders and politicians the ability to operationalize the 'liquid' form of governance. However, whilst LiquidFeedback initially focussed on participation in political parties, Adhocracy developed from Liquid Democracy's view that ""participation via delegated voting should be extended to the whole of society"" [1] . 
 Adhocracy is a modular platform, meaning that for each project it is utilised for, organisers can tailor which modules to use, out of: brainstorming/consultation: used to collect, discuss and rate ideas 
 survey: used to gain feedback on specific topic/s 
 mapping processes: used in civic/planning projects where participants can pin their ideas to specific places 
 text review: allows participants to annotate text documents 
 agenda setting: used to set an agenda either by organisations internally or wider community 
 participatory budgeting Origins and Development 
 Adhocracy was developed by the organization  Liquid Democracy  (not to be confused with the liquid democracy theory of governance) who, like  LiquidFeedback  began their w ork in 2009. The Liquid Democracy Association have developed a range of online tools for participatory processes and is based in Berlin. Since Adhocracy's inception in 2009, additional versions have been released, alongside the development of Adhocracy into a software library where users can choose which 'blocks' are most relevant for their purposes. 
 Adhocracy has been used for a range of different projects, including  meinBerlin , an e-participation platform for residents of Berlin to participate in decisions about urban planning in the city. 
 How it Works 
 As Adhocracy is a software tool that can be used for different projects, there is no set process for selecting participants. Projects may do this in whatever manner they choose. 
 Adhocracy was developed with the notion of deliberative democracy in mind, as well as enhancing democratic and transparent processes  [1] . Each project varies slightly according to its needs. Its founders cite an increased emphasis on the process of decision-making rather than just the final decision. The emphasis in process is realised through the different modules of Adhocracy which were conceived as the different steps of a collaborative decision-making process. 
 Adhocracy projects may also involve offline participation alongside the online tool. One of its key founders, Rouven Brües, describes  a project in Berlin  to decide how to design and develop the site of a former airport. The online platform was used to collect ideas, and these were then discussed in offline workshops that were open for everyone to participate, regardless of whether they had contributed online. 
 Although it was initially inspired by the concept of liquid democracy where people can delegate their votes to others, so far none of the projects using Adhocracy have actually requested this feature  [1] . 
 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 A detailed interview with Rouven Brües can be found on  Open Democracy , outlining some of the lessons and development of Adhocracy.

The CSC method focuses on improving a local government service or process. CARE International's use of Community Score Cards involves a multi-step process and thus constitutes its own methodology, separate from the use of community score cards as a tool for public oversight and evaluation of public services.Using the five-stage, facilitated CSC method, community members meet to develop criteria for evaluating the government service or process, score the service or process on each criterion using a scale from 0 to 100, state reasons to justify each score, and propose improvements concerning each criterion. Those who provide or administer the government service or process meet separately and perform the same evaluation, but using their own criteria. Then community members and service-providers/administrators gather in an ""interface meeting"" to share their findings, identify and prioritize issues for improving the service or process, and create an action plan for carrying out those improvements. The CSC method is then repeated every six months to monitor and evaluate the action plan and to enable ongoing improvement to the service or process.[1]  According to the original report on the CSC,[2] the CSC method was initially designed to address two problems: (1) the inadequate quality of local government services and processes -- especially concerning health care -- in places in which CARE performs development work, and (2) deficiencies in existing participatory methods for evaluating and improving local government services and processes.  The CSC was designed in particular to improve upon the Citizens' Report Card method of participatory service evaluation, in two respects. First, whereas the Citizens' Report Card method was conducted and controlled ""by an external agency,""[3] the CSC gave control of the evaluation process -- including control over the evaluative criteria to be used -- to citizens and service providers or administrators of the government process in question. Second, whereas the policy response to Citizens' Report Card evaluations may be subject to delay, the CSC method was designed to enable ""immediate decisions and the preparation of a mutually agreed action plan"" [4] to address the issues raised by the evaluation.  Principles informing the design of the CSC method include:recognizing the health-related  rights  of citizens  fostering cooperation and  partnership  between users and providers of health services  increasing citizens' access to health-related  informationenabling citizens to  participate in decision making  about health services  increasing  accountability  and  transparency  of health services  promoting  equity  in health services  recognizing  shared responsibility  for health and health services, among users and service providers.[5]Origins and Development  The CSC method was developed by CARE International in Malawi in the early 2000s.[6] Influences on the method include Citizens' Report Card,[7] described above, and possibly also  Participatory Rural Appraisal , which seems to be referred to several times by Kaul Shah (2003) with the phrase ""participatory appraisal.""[8]  The CSC method was developed as part of a project -- called Local Initiatives for Health -- conducted in Lilongwe District, Malawi, to improve local health care in rural areas. After one year of implementation, the CSC method showed promise, which was manifested especially in the increases in citizens' scores of local health services between the first round of CSC evaluations in August 2002 and the second round in March 2003.""[9]  Since 2003, the CSC method has been applied many times in Malawi as well as in other countries including Tanzania, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Egypt, and Afghanistan.[10] In addition to health services, the CSC method has been applied to the improvement of education, economic issues such as the effect of HIV/AIDS on citizens' livelihoods, and governance matters such as  microfinance , water, sanitation, infrastructure, and gender-based violence.[11]  CARE developed a ""governance programming framework"" that serves as a theoretical model or ""theory of change"" for the CSC method.[12] This framework promotes the principle of ""sustainable development with equity,"" and has three elements:""empowered citizens""  ""effective, accountable and responsive service providers and power-holders""  ""expanded, inclusive and effective spaces for negotiation.""[13]The CSC method is designed to put this framework into practice.[14]  CARE has created an initiative focused on the CSC method as part of the United Nations' (UN's) activities concerning the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), called ""Everyone Counts: Using citizen-generated data to monitor progress against the SDGs.""[15]  CARE personnel have recently begun to publish formal evaluations of the CSC method in scholarly journals. These include qualitative evaluations [16] and results of a randomized controlled trial.[17] CARE personnel and affiliated researchers have also published scholarship on the quantitative measures CARE uses to evaluate applications of the CSC.[18]  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Participant selection in the CSC process is generally open to all, and there is targeted recruitment to ensure that participants represent all stakeholders in the community.[19] Targeted recruitment is conducted by having community members draw a social map of the community to identify stakeholders, and then to compare community members currently participating to the social map, to determine whether any stakeholders are not currently represented among participants. However, at times, random selection is also part of participant selection. For example, in a small community all community members can be invited, whereas in a large community, random selection or targeted selection may be more appropriate; and if a community includes a large number of villages and staffing limits prevent including all of them in the process, random selection or purposive sampling might be used to select villages to be included in the process.[20]  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Phase I of the CSC process is devoted to preparation. Preparation takes place for up to one month, in which organizers meet with community leaders and stakeholders to learn about key issues concerning governmental services or processes that are of concern to community members. Organizers conduct interviews with stakeholders to identify issues and the range of local perspectives on them. Organizers determine the scope of the community to be included in the process, choose approaches for including community members in the process, determine the budget for the process, train or invite facilitators, and determine how community units will be approached and how groups of community members will be organized.[21]  In Phase II of the CSC process, members of the community meet in groups, each led by two facilitators. Each group identifies issues concerning the government service or process, develops indicators to evaluate the service or process, and scores the service or process on each indicator on a scale of 0 to 100. Then group members gather in a ""cluster consolidation meeting"" to reconcile differences between the different issues and indicators identified by the groups, identify reasons to justify the score for each consolidated indicator, create a consolidated score for the community, reflect on the results, prioritize issues that require immediate action, and suggest improvements regarding each indicator and issue.[22]  In Phase III of the CSC process, the providers or administrators of the government service or process conduct a parallel evaluation of the service or process, again using facilitators but developing their own indicators.[23]  In Phase IV of the CSC process, community members and service providers/administrators gather together in an ""interface meeting."" During that meeting, both groups share the results of their evaluations, identify common findings, and negotiate a list of issues that are priorities for action. Then the community members and service providers/administrators together create an action plan to implement improvements concerning the priority issues, assign tasks in the plan to particular community members and service providers/administrators, and create deadlines for implementation and reporting.  In Phase V of the CSC process, community members and the service providers/administrators implement the action plan, and monitor and assess improvements to the service or process.  The CSC process is then repeated every six months to enable ongoing evaluation and improvement of the service or process, in a partnership between community members and service providers/administrators.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Several outcomes have been identified in studies of the CSC method (Edward et al., 2015; Gullo et al., 2016, 2017), including:enhanced citizen  voice  in governance  more  collective action  to address community needs  greater  participation  of citizens in governance  greater  accountability  of service providers and administrators  improvements in citizens' access to  informationgains in citizens'  knowledge  of their rights, of limitations that service providers face, etc.  changes in citizens'  expectations  of government services  improvements in  communication  and  relationship  between citizens and service providers  more  respectful  and  welcoming  treatment of citizens by service providers  enhanced  responsiveness  and  transparency  of government services  gains in service-provider  capacity  and  commitmentimproved  trust  between citizens and service providers  increased  availability  and  quality  of services  increased  use  of services by citizens  greater citizen  satisfaction  with services  improved  outcomes  in health, agriculture, and education .Analysis and Lessons Learned  Researchers have identified several challenges to using the CSC method (Edward et al., 2015; Kaul Shah, 2003). First, competent facilitation is a key component of the method, so the method requires time or resources for employing or training facilitators. Facilitation is needed in particular to prevent conflict, which is often a concern in CSC processes. Second, the successful application of the method seems to depend on many context-specific factors, so substantial preparation and the thorough exercise of the first phase of the method seem necessary. Third, although allowing citizens and service providers to create their own indicators for evaluating services is the key to many of the desirable dynamics and consequences of the method, that customization of indicators can at times cause administrative difficulties in reconciling differences in indicators between citizens and service providers or among different groups of citizens. Fourth, the CSC method can be quite demanding on citizens, particularly the deliberative process of reconciling diverse indicators. Finally, whereas the CSC method has been especially effective at realizing improvements that are within the control of the local community, at times improvements that depend on more distant regional or national governments have been more difficult to implement.

 Problems and Purpose 
 The Social Mobilisation Campaign (SMC) model is an approach used by the Creative Centre for Community Mobilisation (CRECCOM) to mobilise and empower rural communities to fully own their development. The model uses a combination of participatory methodologies, rights based approaches, results based management, collective action, and policy advocacy tools to enhance individual capabilities (CRECCOM Pamphlet). Central to this model is the STAR Circles (Village Forums), which is aimed at mobilising, gathering and encouraging community members to discuss, deliberate and propose solutions to the collective problems they face. 
 CRECCOM is a Malawian non-governmental organisation based in the Southern Region of Malawi in the city of Zomba. The organisation aims to establish vibrant communities that help effect change through the effective use of creative approaches in order to sensitise, motivate, mobilise and empower individuals and stakeholders towards participation in development initiatives (see creccom.org). Mobilisation is a core value of this organisation, as it believes in encouraging communities not to be recipients but to actively recognise their needs and propose their own solutions. CRECCOM is known for implementing community mobilisation interventions in areas of HIV/Aids, education, gender and women empowerment and climate change resilience (CRECCOM Pamphlet). 
 The SMC model forms part of CRECCOM’s overall approach to development. It employs ‘grassroots level methodologies and person-to-person communication at the community level... and then mobilizes communities to accept responsibility and take action to address those issues’ and keep key stakeholders and policy makers informed (Janet Robb, Madalo Samati and Suzgo Mwanza 2001). The model is largely comprised of four key components, namely: research and verification, field worker training, community-based sensitisation and village/community-based initiatives. 
 CRECCOM adopted the model because mobilising communities is central to their strategy for development. The organisation does not believe in helping communities as recipients of services but rather aims to empower these communities and encourage ownership in development. The belief is premised on the idea that communities know themselves better than outsiders who go in to implement projects. Therefore, it is essential to involve the community in a meaningful way. The SMC model helps in this regard, as the projects implemented by CRECCOM go through various stages of the model which has built-in participatory mechanisms, not only directed to the project but also in general. This is seen as an important element of the SMC model since Malawi is lagging behind in development and citizen engagement is limited. 
 Origins and Development 
 The SMC model was developed by the Creative Associates International (CAII), which is an American organisation based in Washington. According to the their website, CAII is an international organisation operating around the globe, it focuses ‘...on building inclusive educational systems, transitioning communities from conflict to peace, developing sustainable economic growth, engaging youth, promoting transparent elections and more.’ 
 The development of the SMC model began in Malawi in the 1990s as a strategy that was aimed at grass roots level engagements ‘to increase girls' access to and participation in formal basic education programs’ and ‘...to improve community participation in educational quality and yet another to raise community awareness of strategies to combat the proliferation of HIV/AIDS.’(Janet Robb, Madalo Samati and Suzgo Mwanza 2001). 
 The success of these initiatives influenced the decision to establish CRECCOM as a way to continue making a difference in mobilising and empowering communities in Malawi. The founding of the organisation was facilitated by CAII and the organisation adopted the SMC model. The SMC model has evolved overtime through lessons learned in the context of Malawian communities.

 How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making 
 The SMC model is implemented through various projects that CRECCOM is involved in. Each project goes through the various components of the model and the activities involved depend of the nature of the project itself, while still keeping the overall design. The major components of the model are: research and verification, field worker training, community-based sensitisation and village/community-based initiatives and at times these stages run concurrently. In addition to these key components, there are supporting components such as stakeholder involvement, role model initiative, mass communication interventions and monitoring and evaluation at each stage of the process. (CRECCOM Pamphlet). 1. Research and verificationThe process begins with research and verification in order find out the needs of the community and how these can be addressed through a specific project. In each community and for each project, CRECCOM starts with conducting research in the community using participatory methodologies such as action research employing a variety of tools including theatre for development and community focus group discussions. CRECCOM does not ‘believe in just extracting knowledge in people, we think it’s not helping us.’ (Madalo Samati, 8 November 2016). This belief is rooted in the model’s commitment in involving beneficiaries of projects, ensuring their contribution and eventually ownership CRECCOM Pamphlet) of development initiatives. 
 At the beginning of a project, any organisation wishing to implement or do any kind of initiative in any village in Malawi is required to make an appointment with the local chief in order to discuss what that organisations aims to do. This is where the process begins, with asking for the chief’s permission to work in the village. Upon getting permission, the chief then calls a community meeting to introduce the people to the project. It is in this meeting that participants in the project can be selected and/or volunteer to be part of the discussions. 
 At the end of this process, the research results are shared with relevant stakeholders, particularly those in government. These include civil servants that work in specific areas that are covered by CRECCOM’s projects such as education, gender empowerment, etc. Through these engagements CRECCOM has established good working relationships with civil servants in relevant departments as well as with local chiefs. This can somewhat be attributed the their overall approach which does not side line already existing structures and rather works in and around them, to revitalise and capacitate them to work for the people as well as the local elite. In this regard CRECCOM Director believes that: 
 CRECCOM is a darling of government because of the approach that we use. So really we’ve not had any problems. There’s been situation where the teachers were on strike, when we get to their schools, we work with them even though they are on strike... because of the approach, the way we do business, 
 This is a testament to the trust and good relations build by the organisation particularly with civil servants. Their good working relations are not limited to civil servants as also includes the local elite. The importance of chiefs and traditional leadership in general is widely accepted in Malawi and thus organisations working in development are aware of this and work with them on many occasions. The significance of this stakeholder is central in understanding how mobilisation of communities can happen. 2. Field worker trainingField worker training is the second stage in the SMC model. This stage is directed at training government civil servants after they have been notified of the research findings. The training is usually based on the issues highlighted by the research findings. CRECCOM then targets relevant civil servants as required by the project they aim to implement in a specific village, for example health worker, educators, etc. 
 The civil servants are trained on participatory methodologies and ways to enlighten communities in order to reach self-realisation about the problems that are facing them and to work together to find solutions. This stage involves the creation of action plans by the relevant civil servants based on the research findings. They also conduct community workshops, while CRECCOM monitors and gives support in these activities. (Madalo Samati, 8 November 2016). 3. Community-based sensitisationAfter field worker training, the trained civil servants go the specific communities and target specific stakeholders depending on the project. The target group includes local chiefs, village agents, interested parties and the community at large. The purpose of this stage is to raise community awareness of the issues raised by the research that was conducted. 
 An important component at this stage is the targeting, training and capacity building of village agents. Village agents are a semi-formal elected position that is recognised and created by government as a way to effect change in local communities. However, these agents do not exist in every village and where they do exist, they are not very active. So, in some cases CRECCOM oversees the elections of these agents for specific projects. These agents become the link between the project and the community. 
 Each village gets to elect one village agent. The agent is elected in a public meeting after CRECCOM has shared the qualities that an agent should possess. For example, village agents are required to be active in the community, to be ‘someone influential, educated at least to junior certificate level, someone who is fully conversant of the traditional cultural practices of the area, so on’( Geoffrey Kamanga, 8 November 2016). The term for elected village agents is not clear, at times it is linked to specific projects and sometimes it continues beyond a specific project. 
 Upon the election of the village agent, CRECCOM builds capacity of such an agent. Village agents are trained in facilitating community dialogues, research skills, report writing, etc. These skills are seen as essential since CRECCOM believes that community dialogues should be research based ‘not empty dialogue based on what is happening elsewhere, something they heard on the radio, rather they should focus on things that are happening in their locality’ (Geoffrey Kamanga, 8 November 2016). They are also trained on how to advocate for their community and lobby government officials and policy makers. 
 This stage is really about raising awareness on communal issues so that relevant stakeholders and community members may deliberate further. 4. Village/Community based InitiativesThe community based initiatives follow after the community has been exposed to a specific project and the issues that arise in the research have been shared with the relevant stakeholders. At this stage the elected village agents or change agents are charged with championing community discussions. The community forums or STAR Circles as CRECCOM calls them, are made up of various community members including cultural customs experts. These forums are established in each village where CRECCOM works. The members of these forums range between 12-25 people who meet on regular basis to discuss issues of concern in the community. In general anyone can join the forums, but they have to be people who are committed to making change in their communities and those who are willing to give up their time to volunteer to be part of the discussions. Members volunteer to be part of the discussion in a public meeting and they become representatives of the community. 
 These forums deliberate and identify the major problems they are facing regarding a particular issue, identify the causes of the problems, propose solutions and develop work plans. The village agent is key in these deliberations as he/she is in charge of facilitating the discussion, documenting and reporting resolutions that have been proposed at these discussions. 
 The village agents also work closely with local chiefs. Chiefs have to first buy in into the project and once that happens, then the project can go ahead. The village agents have to report to the chiefs on everything that happens on the forums, they have to report on decisions that are made and they have to explain why those decisions have been taken. The chief then calls a community meeting where the community would discuss its bylaws taking into account what was discussed in the village forums. (Geoffrey Kamanga, 8 November 2016). 
 At this stage the communities really take ownership of their development and implement diverse strategies in dealing with particular matters depending on the nature of the project. Other supporting components of the modelIn addition to the core components of this model, there are other supporting components, including stakeholder involvement, role model initiative, mass communication interventions and monitoring and evaluation. These components also form part of the SMC model, but are secondary to the core activities, which involve more direct contact with targeted communities. Largely, these components are about involving the society at large and also reflecting on the model itself.

 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 Generally, CRECCOM believes that the SMC model is beneficial to the communities in which they implement their projects. Of particular note are the village level initiatives, which are supposed to institute a bottom-up approach to development. However, it is not clear how influential these initiatives are in overall development of the areas since there are various structures at village level, at traditional authority level, at District level and so on, which are tasked with development, such as the Village Development Committees and Area Development Committees. The Area Development Committee for instance ‘facilitates planning and development at the TA [Traditional Authority] level. Specifically, the committee sets priorities, identify and prepare project proposals addressing community needs, which cover more than one VDC [Village Development Committee]’ (Bokho, 2014:34). In principle, initiatives that result from using the SMC model are supposed to be escalated and presented in these structures. 
 However, these structures are established for purposes beyond one specific project and have to take into account various views from different communities and their reach may be limited, which means that some of the decisions made through the model may not necessarily result in influencing planning initiatives for development. In this regard, Chirwa (2014:21-22) points out that decentralisation laws in Malawi ‘do not provide any policy, planning or budgeting role for lower local government and decentralisation structures.’ In essence, the grassroots mobilisation achieved through the SMC model and the decisions that are made concerning development in specific localities may be subject to structural constraints regarding budgeting and planning that is not done at the local level. This demonstrates that decentralisation efforts here may only provide partial space for meaningful grassroots involvement. 
 Furthermore, CRECCOM acknowledges that whatever progress they make in specific communities, that progress is limited due to lack of continuity when the organisation moves on from a specific project. ‘The biggest challenge we have is to follow on those projects...and that’s one of the reasons why our change has been slow. We’ll start the process and stop it somewhere’ (Madalo Samati, 8 November 2016). Thus, limited continuity has a negative effect not only on specific projects, but also on the model itself since it aims to mobilise and empower communities. The lack of sustainability here further limits the impact and progress achieved through the SMC model. 
 Even so, there are cases where villages have continued with the STAR Circle dialogues beyond a CRECCOM project, though this is not widespread. Since this is a voluntary process, people tend to lose interest when it is not linked to a specific project. Also, related is the lack of male participants in these forums as they would rather spend more time doing activities that will earn an income rather than volunteer to be part of village forums. Beyond this though, the question of why people ‘lose interest’ in being part of the village forums that afford them a voice is an important one as this could be useful for practitioners. 
 Similarly of note for practitioners is the relationship between existing structures of authority such as traditional leadership (chiefs) and the organising entity. As highlighted here, CRECCOM has a good working relationship with traditional leaders. In practice chiefs are an important power broker in Malawi’s ‘hybrid system’ even though by law their powers might not be very clear. ‘The status of traditional leaders is partially recognised in the constitution and in the legislation and policy framework establishing local government authorities. Though the constitution does not specifically define the office, powers, functions and position of chiefs in the country...’ (Chirwa, 2014:24). The chiefs are central in rural life, in many ways they influential in gaining access to communities. As one NGO leader puts it ‘When you enter into the village, how you communicate and talk to the chief will determine your success tomorrow, you have to humble yourself... (Interview, 3 November 2016). This highlights the level of power the chiefs have in their jurisdictions. Thus, any grass root mobilisation that aims to influence policy has to go through the chiefs, though this is not necessarily a democratic structure, it certainly is a structure that is most visible in local communities

 STAR Circles is an approach aimed at encouraging community members to gather together, deliberate, and propose solutions to issues of community concern. The process is intended to result in communities taking ownership over their development. 
 The approach is a major component of the Creative Centre for Community Mobilisation’s (CRECCOM) Social Mobilisation Campaign (SMC) model, which is used to mobilise and empower rural communities to fully own their development. The model uses a combination of participatory methodologies, rights based approaches, results based management, collective action, policy advocacy and tools to enhance individual capabilities. In the SMC model, STAR Circles largely form part of village level initiatives, other components include: research and verification, field worker training and community-based sensitisation. 
 CRECCOM is a Malawian non-governmental organisation based in the city of Zomba, located in the Southern Region of Malawi. The organisation aims to establish vibrant communities that help effect change through the use of creative approaches in order to sensitise, motivate, mobilise and empower individuals and stakeholders towards participation in development initiatives. 
 The STAR Circle approach is also used by other organisations that operate and implement projects in Malawi. These organisations include ActionAid, A Self-Help Assistance Program, Society for Women and AIDS in Malawi and Women’s Legal Resource Centre amongst others. 
 The STAR Circles are used to highlight issues that are challenging communities and also provide a platform for these issues to be discussed in a public arena. According to CRECCOM Director, Madalo Samati, for organisations like CRECCOM, mobilising communities is key in developing and improving people’s lives as they believe in encouraging communities not to be recipients but to actively recognise their needs and propose their own solutions.(Interview, 8 November 2016) It for this reason that CRECCOM decided to use the STAR Circle approach to help deal with community issues. Furthermore, they realised that when external actors go into a village, the local residents would tell that person what they believe they would like to hear, not necessarily ‘what is happening at the grassroots’(Geoffrey Kamanga , 8 November 2016) level. This realisation prompted CRECCOM to instead take a step back and let the people discuss amongst themselves in order to get a better understanding of the issues they are faced with and how they can deal with them. 
 Origins and Development 
 The STAR Circles approach evolved out of strategies for dealing with HIV/Aids issues. STAR is an abbreviation for Societies Tackling AIDS through Rights. It is a participatory approach for community mobilisation, empowerment and response to HIV (Clarke, 2010). The purpose of the intervention is to empower and increase meaningful participation of people living with HIV in issues that directly affects them. The achievements of the STAR Circles Approach in the HIV/Aids field included improved self-confidence which increased participation, reduction of harmful cultural practices and reducing stigma and discrimination (Kuphanga. 2014) demonstrates the value of this approach. 
 Though initially established to primarily mobilise people against sexual diseases, the approach has evolved due to its perceived benefits for communities. Organisations such as the Creative Centre for Community Mobilisation encourage villages to discuss any topic in the forums and many times it has led to unexpected results. The development and increasing use of this approach reveals its importance in raising community awareness on important community concerns and empowering communities to do demand their rights. 
 The approach is now largely used as a general vehicle for community discussions and in particular to implement participatory development projects. CRECCOM leaders note that before they introduced this approach, there was a lack of opportunity for meaningful discussion around issues facing communities, instead people only met at funerals and wedding ceremonies (Geoffrey Kamanga, 8 November 2016). So these meetings provide a space for communities to gather and discuss. 
 Participant Recruitment and Selection 
 The selection process starts with the election of the village agent, who plays and integral part in the STAR Circle meetings, which is then followed by the recruitment of other members including cultural gate keepers such as initiation counsellors. 
 Each village gets to elect one village agent. The agent is elected in a public meeting called by the chief, and CRECCOM shares the qualities that an agent should possess. For example, village agents are required to be active in the community, to be ‘someone influential, educated at least to junior certificate level, someone who is fully conversant of the traditional cultural practices of the area, so on’ (Geoffrey Kamanga, 8 November 2016). The term for elected village agents is not clear, at times it is linked to specific projects and sometimes it continues beyond a specific project. 
 Upon the election of the village agent, CRECCOM builds capacity of him/her. Village agents are trained in facilitating community dialogues, research skills, report writing, etc. These skills are seen as essential since CRECCOM believes that community dialogues should be research based ‘not empty dialogue based on what is happening elsewhere, something they heard on the radio, rather they should focus on things that are happening in their locality’(Geoffrey Kamanga, 8 November 2016). . They are also trained on how to advocate for their community and lobby government officials and policy makers. The village agents are central in running the STAR Circle processes as they are tasked with organising the gatherings, facilitating the discussions, documenting and reporting to the chiefs and to CRECCOM. 
 The members of the STAR Circles are between 12-25 people who meet on regular basis to discuss issues of concern in the community. In general anyone can join the forums, but they have to people who are committed to making change in their communities and those who are willing to give up their time to volunteer to be part of the discussion. Members volunteer to be part of the discussion in a public meeting and they become representatives of the community. When people volunteer themselves to be part of the process, community members may object if they do not believe that person embodies the qualities that are required in order to be part of the STAR Circles. 
 How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making 
 The STAR Circles are village level initiatives that have been championed and supported by CRECCOM. However, CRECCOM staff does not take part in the community discussion. The process is aimed at empowering community members to take charge or their own development needs. The frequency of these meetings is decided by the members of these groups, it ranges from weekly to monthly depending on the type of engagement. The process involves the ground work for establishing a circle, selecting participants, the community dialogues and decision making Establishing a STAR CircleCRECCOM is only one the organisations that uses this approach to implement its projects. They oversee and monitor the whole process, from the beginning to the end. For CRECCOM, the process starts with the other components of the SMC model, that is, with research and verification, where they conduct action research in the targeted village/community. After the research is conducted, they share their findings with relevant stakeholders, particularly civil servants who work in the designated target thematic areas such as education, gender, climate change, child rights, etc. These civil servants are then trained and capacitated to develop relationships and work in the villages. In turn, the civil servants develop work plans based on the research and target specific stakeholders including chiefs, cultural leaders, religious leaders and community members in a particular community and they also conduct some dialogues. CRECCOM further goes through community sensitisation, where they raise awareness on a particular issue as informed by the initial research. They also engage with the chiefs, the community and other stakeholders. Chiefs are very important in this process as their buy-in is required for any project to move forward. In each village, CRECCOM first approaches the chief and discuss any plan they have for a project and the chief then grants permission for them to work in the village. Without the chief’s support it would be difficult to implement a project as one NGO leader observes ‘When you enter into the village, how you communicate and talk to the chief will determine your success tomorrow, you have to humble yourself...’ (Interview, 3 November 2016). This demonstrates how powerful chiefs are in the villages and that their backing is essential. 
 CRECCOM also targets village agents where they exist or helps elect them where they do not already exist. A village agent is a semi-formal elected position that is recognised and created by the government as a way to effect change in local communities. However, these agents do not exist in every village and where they do exist, they are not very active. So, in some cases CRECCOM oversees the elections of these agents for specific projects. These agents become the link between the project and the community. 
 The major role played by CRECCOM in this process is that of funding and monitoring the activities particularly those pertaining to CRECCOM projects. Community dialogues and decision makingThe members of the forum come together to discuss burning issues of the day and at that level ‘solicit the causes and identify possible solutions or mitigation strategies...’ (Geoffrey Kamanga, 8 November 2016). These forums identify the major problems they are facing regarding a particular issue, identify the causes of the problems, propose solutions and develop work plans. The village agent is key in these deliberations as he/she is in charge of facilitating the discussion, documenting and reporting resolutions that have been proposed at these discussions. 
 The village agents also work closely with local chiefs. The village agents have to report to the chiefs on everything that happens on the forums, they have to report on decisions that are made and they have to explain why those decisions have been taken. The chief then calls a community meeting and then the community would discuss its bylaws taking into account what was discussed in the village forums 
 If the proposed solutions to village issue require external support, the community reaches out to concerned civil society organisation such as CRECCOM or they reach out to government extension workers or relevant duty bearers. Furthermore, the chief can also escalate an issue to a higher level to get support. The village chief can report the issue in the Area Development Committee (ADC), which is at Traditional Authority (TA) level. This level is made up of numerous villages, and the ADC is where the chiefs from different villages meet and discuss development issues in the area. According to Chasukwa, Chiweza and Chikapa-Jamali (2014:707) the ADC is one the structures ‘through which local people can make their contributions on matters of local public life.’ The public contributes in ADC discussion through community representatives such as chiefs, community based organisations and the like. In this approach issues that are raised in one village may be discussed at TA level and shared with other villages that might not have a forum like STAR Circles. 
 The major decisions made in this process are those directly affecting the community, particularly those that can be resolved through the implementation of local strategies, particularly the bylaws. The members of the forum become representatives of the community and make decisions on their behalf. They report and explain these decisions to the chief, who is the ultimate decision maker around making bylaws, although there are discussions.

 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 The STAR Circle process is not linear and its use is not limited to CRECCOM. The major achievement of this approach is getting people together to talk. To a large degree in areas where CRECCOM has established STAR Circles, there has been a great change, particularly in terms of communities recognising and acknowledging the problems that they face, whether that problem is related to child labour, education of the girl child, etc. CRECCOM believes this is an achievement. Beyond acknowledging the problems faced in these communities, CRECCOM believes that people are more willing to ask questions and to follow up on government promises. Government leaders are also aware that they cannot just manipulate the people anymore as the communities that have the village forums show more agency (Madalo Samati, 8 November 2016). 
 Furthermore, the discussion of issues raised in the STAR Circle process in the ADC meeting further promotes the approach. CRECCOM encourages this kind of escalation from village level to TA level, which at times influences other villages to establish STAR Circle processes of their own. As a result of this replication, STAR Circles also exist in villages where CRECCOM has not been championing this process but rather as a result of the benefits seen from existing STAR Circles’ (Geoffrey Kamanga, 8 November 2016). The forums are sometimes also replicated at TA level, where a forum that is made up of all the villages in a TA is established. 
 However, CRECCOM acknowledges that one of the major challenges in this approach is problems with continuity once the organisation moves on from a particular project. Although there are cases where the village has continued with the STAR Circle dialogues beyond a CRECCOM project, this is not widespread. Since this is a voluntary process, people tend to lose interest when it is not linked to a specific project. Also, related is the lack of male participants in these forums as they would rather spend time doing activities that will earn an income rather than volunteer to be part of village forums. 
 In terms of the decision making, the process seems limited. The decisions made at these forums seem to be still subject to the chief’s approval. Beyond that, if the proposed solutions require external support, it is difficult to ensure that the action plans that were agreed upon can be implemented. This seems to be a bottom up process, but it is not clear on how high up it can go. Nonetheless, the increasing use of this approach highlights its benefits and importance. 
 Notable, the approach works with already existing structures of community participation such as village agents, Village Development Committees and ADCs. The use of these structures does not only help mitigate the relationship between already established power brokers such as chiefs, but also seems to revive these structures in areas where they have become dormant due to various challenges. 
 The role played by village agents in the village forums (STAR Circles) is indicative of the capacity that is provided through this approach, it certainly addresses the lack of funding and skills that is associated with many structures at village level. For instance, Adamolekun notes that the government extension systems responsible for the mobilisation of ADCs and other structures of community participation ‘lack resources and are, as a result, weak, poorly-motivated and unable to ensure that communities can participate in planning and program implementation’ (Bokho, 2014:41). Similarly, Chirwa (2014) believes ‘the local government system is still weak and undeveloped due to the dependency on central government grants, the lack of administrative capacity, lack of experience and inadequate grassroots participation in local authority affairs.’ These highlight the challenges that affect the functioning of the structures that are meant to enhance community participation at local level. Clearly, any dysfunction at this level limits the influence that local communities could have. The use of STAR Circles in local communities and the way they incorporate and work with these structures is beneficial in assisting deal with the challenges such as lack of capacity since organisation like CRECCOM build capacity and empower communities through the process. 
 Furthermore, the fact that this approach builds on existing structures, means it is easily seen as acceptable by both government and local elites. Both entities do not seem to feel threatened by the contributions made through this approach as it is seen as working within the system. This is arguable one of the reasons that both government civil servants and local elites have welcomed working with CRECCOM. 
 Ultimately, the space for open community discussion amongst community members empowers the people to act. Using this approach seems to extend some democratisation at local level in a space where traditional leadership dominates. In many ways, community participation in rural areas happens through village level and area level structures through the chiefs and other community representatives. The STAR Circle approach adds a level of community deliberation, where the communities discuss amongst themselves and are empowered through the process.

The pictures can then be used, usually with captions composed by the photographers, to bring the realities of the photographers’ lives home to the public and policy makers and to spur change.[1]  The purpose of photovoice is produce and share knowledge in service of three main goals: (1) to enable people to record and reflect their community's strengths and concerns, (2) to promote critical dialogue and knowledge about important issues through large and small group discussion of photographs, and (3) to reach policymakers.[2]  Photovoice is commonly used as a tool for  Community-Based Participatory Research  (CBPR) in the fields of community development, international development, public health, and education as a way of empowering research subjects to produce unbiased accounts of their experience, to help gather data for a specific research problem, and as tool evaluate programs and processes.[3] Common research themes include community concerns, community assets, social issues, and public health barriers.[2]  Origins and Development  In 1992, photovoice was developed by Caroline C. Wang of the University of Michigan, and Mary Ann Burris, Program Officer for Women's Health at the Ford Foundation headquartered in Beijing, China. The idea was built on the foundation that images and words together can effectively express the needs problems, and desires of individuals and communities.[3]  Photovoice was first used to empower the silenced rural women in Yunnan Province, China to influence the policies and programs affecting them.[4] Since then, the number of Photovoice studies has multiplied drastically.[5]  Photovoice emerged out of three overlapping theoretical frameworks:Empowerment education theory[6] - specializes in facilitating critical consciousness by encouraging individuals to become vocal about the needs of the community [7]  Feminist theory - acknowledges the experiences of women as a catalyst for social change and in turn, encourages women to share the knowledge and “know-how” regarding their understanding of how communities and dominant institutions affect their lives. Furthermore, feminist theory believes women should be the ones leading and carrying out policies changes rather than having the changes made on their behalf [4]  Documentary photography - places image capture the control into the hands of the oppressed, allowing them to become the decision makers and elect the themes that are represented among the photos[4]Since photovoice was developed as an  action research method , it has been widely taken up among researchers, artists and social advocates as a way to make research methodologies more equitable and influence decision-making by highlighting perspectives of marginalized or under-represented groups. It has similarities with  participatory reflection and action ,  community service-learning , and  community-based participatory research .  How it Works  Photovoice has been predominantly been used to engage people who are discriminated against due to language, gender, race, class, disability, and age as a way to communicate their concerns to policymakers and service providers. [1][8]  Recruitment and selection is often done before hand. For example, tools from the community tool box are employed by researchers during participant recruitment to better capture the experiences of the community under study – often this means engaging with a few community leaders and depending on word-of-mouth to encourage participation by harder-to-reach demographics.  Participant groups in photovoice projects are relatively small, usually ranging between 10-35 people at a time.  While there are some standards components to photovoice, it is often adapted to different formats in order to fit specific contexts. Participant groups in photovoice projects are relatively small, usually ranging between 10-35 people at a time. Depending on the context and scale of the project, the researcher(s) may hold multiple training sessions and/or conduct several photovoice initiatives within one project.  Depending on the nature of the project, photovoice can often be followed by larger community  deliberations , decision-making, and implementation.  The basic components generally included in a photovoice projects are:Introduction to the project: The researcher builds familiarity within the group and describes the social action plan and/or policy component;  Photography training: The researcher(s) facilitates a process (often in collaboration with a third party practitioner) for participants become familiar with the fundamentals of photography, ethics and safety; [9]Individuals go into their communities and take pictures that represent their concerns.  Facilitated discussion(s): once the photos are completed, the individuals share with one another and the researcher(s) what the photographs mean to them. The group dialogue allows the individuals to build upon each other’s concerns and help shape the identified needs of the community. [4] Discussion often centers on five questions, designated by ""the acronym SHOWeD: What do yous  ee here? What is reallyh  appening here? How does this relate too  ur lives?W  hy does this problem, concern, or strength exist? What can wed  o about it?"" [10]  Exhibition: the photographs are made public through a community exhibit where policy makers are invited as a way to promote dialogue around address the community needs and issues.[9]  Final debrief: after the exhibition, there is a final debrief with the researcher(s) to help prepare for the next steps of the project whether it be implementing the social action plan or continue with the photography and discussion process. [5]Note: The above is an idealized version of a photovoice project; many photovoice project do not complete all six steps due to underfunded studies or the complex nature of some government/policy processes.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  As a tool, photovoice can play an important role in forming bonds between participants and surface problems participants will be working on and/or solving together.  Many researchers have claimed that photovoice has led to significant impacts including significantly diversifying the type of groups being surveyed (providing insights into communities that would have otherwise been inaccessible); enhancing the depth of information being collected and enabling groups to overcome social barriers and better communicate their experiences, perspectives and feelings to other community members and policy makers. [5] Researchers also noted how photovoice allowed for bonds to form between the participants that prepared them to solve problems and work together. [10]  Since its introduction, several researchers have critiqued the photovoice method. These criticisms have focused on ethical dilemmas. [11][12][13][14]; on methodological and technical challenges [12][15][16]; and on the extent of social justice impacts. [17]Also, other analyses of photovoice have suggested that researchers have yet to embrace the full potential of the method:Hergenrather et al. (2009) reviewed 31 articles to determine how photovoice promoted individual and community change and reported inconsistencies in the photovoice process amongst the studies. They recommended the need for researchers to identify both researchers' and participants' role in all aspects of the project.[18]  Catalani and Minkler (2010) used Wang’s photovoice approach to explicate the positive relationship among community involvement, individual empowerment, community asset recognition, and action towards policy change. The critique focused on how the photovoice process was undertaken (e.g. recruitment, sample size, sample characteristics, and training), including a particular focus on the elements of participant engagement (e.g. “participant involvement”, and “empowerment”). Inconsistencies in rigor and fit between the method and the particular health concern of interest were noted.[9]  Sanon, M. A., Evans‐Agnew, R. A., &amp; Boutain, D. M. (2014) extend Catalani and Minkler’s (2010) analysis to review and describe the social justice impact of photovoice research. They extended the discussion on methodology and ‘method fit’ for 30 articles published since 2008 and found that research designs involving photovoice continue to under-deliver their action and social justice potential.[17]Lessons LearnedLack of Social Action PlanIt has been noted that neglecting to include a social action plan into photovoice methodology may negatively impact marginalized communities by leaving members of the community to feel objectified because of the lack of follow-through. In a situation such as this, the researchers may receive beneficial rewards from the photovoice project in the form of a published paper or the rich data collected, which can be shared and disseminated. However, the community has not gained from the project. Individuals within the community may feel their efforts were made in vain since no advancement has been made to improve the well-being of the community.[5]Lack of group process and dialogueAnother deviation from the theoretical framework of photovoice is the absence of group process and dialogue. Facilitated discussions are a central component of photovoice as it allows participants to engage with people with similar backgrounds and experiences. Group dialogue allows participants to build upon each others’ ideas. The exchange of thoughts connects people, creating a support network to encourage one another. Borrowed from Freire,[6] group dialogue allows critical thinking to occur in such a way that the participants must work together to uncover the source of dissatisfaction. [7] Group dialogue inspires people to believe in their ability to influence and control their environment. Without the group component, participates are less likely to fully invest themselves in the photovoice process.[5]  See AlsoVisual participatory methods to develop local knowledge on HIV in rural South AfricaParticipatory Action Research in Agincourt Socio-demographic Surveillance SiteApathy is BoringGen Why MediaSocial Innovation Labs   References  [1] Community Toolbox.

 Problems and Purpose 
 First implemented in Portland, Oregan, the community participation program model is used predominantly in instance of sustained, citizen-lead or involved urban planning and upkeep. The CPP is essentially an institutionalized mechanism of public participation in local planning projects and its procedures draw on or incorporate numerous other methods such as neighbourhood management and community-based monitoring. Unique to the CPP is its governmental recognition and institutionalization. Existing 'on top of' or alongside existing activities and processes of government , the CPP provides a stable channel of communication between disparate actors such as municipal bodies, community organizations, neighbourhood associations, and individuals.[4] The CPP is essentially an institutionalized mechanism of public participation in local planning projects and its procedures draw on or incorporate numerous other methods such as neighbourhood management and community-based monitoring. [1] 
 Origins and Development 
 The first community participation program was developed in Portland and was adopted in a slightly modified form after hurricane Katrina by the non-profit Committee for a Better New Orleans.[2] The system is also used in a number of other American municipalities including Birmingham, Alabama; Atlanta, Georgia; Charleston, South Carolina; and Dayton, Ohio.[3] 
 Both the original CPP and its New Orlean's offshoot were designed in response to public demands for more representation and participation in city projects affecting their communities. Once in place, the CPP provides a forum for the discussion or review of any planning or development project with the potential to impact local residents or neighbourhoods. In using the CPP, affected parties (government officials, community representatives, business interests, etc.) commit to a process of extensive outreach and dialogue so that community concerns can be raised and addressed by project developers before implementation.[1]

 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 A lot of citizens in New Orleans don’t know about the CPP even though the Committee for a Better New Orleans does outreach activities. As well, the CPP operation is currently not funded even though part of the model has been taken by the city such as an early notification system of neighbourhoods. A Neighbourhood Engagement Plan has been set up by the city in order to get quality input from communities on projects.[2]

By implementing a system of community oversight and feedback, service providers can better align their efforts to the specific needs of the community. CBM also gives the local population more control over the kinds of services being provided and introduces a level of popular oversight which can increase the efficiency and quality of those services. CBM is thus one of the most effective and low-cost forms of community capacity-building.  Origins and Development  Participant Recruitment and Selection  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the  United Nations , CBM typically encompasses five stages: assessment, monitoring, evaluation, analysis, and presentation.[1] The extent to which each of these five stages is performed by the community or the service providers depends on several factors including funding, local infrastructure, and existing channels of public communication.  Numerous tools are utilized to perform CBM, including  community score cards ,  surveys , semi-structured interviews,  participatory arts , and SWOL analysis, among others.[1]  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Analysis and Lessons Learned  See AlsoThe Black Sash Model of Community Based Monitoring (CBM)References  [1] Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

 Civic or 'public' journalism refers to the integration of journalism and democracy; the intersection of reporting and deliberation. News and media outlets that employ civic journalism do not just report 'the facts'; rather, they write in a way that creates or facilitates public engagement, conversation, and debate. Civic journalism reports news in a way that encourages and facilitates public deliberation on political and social issues. 
 The goal of civic journalism is to draw the audience into a discussion; to engage the public in a debate of the key political and social issues; and to give reporters and news readers the space to participate - rather than just observe - the democratic process.

The goal of Public Debates is to include all stakeholders and affected individuals in the planning process of large public works. In Italy, the  Tuscan Region's Authority for the Promotion of Participation  has institutionalized the Public Debate through the  Regional Participation Policy .  Origins and Development  Public Debates were first institutionalized in France following protests against the buidling of the high-speed TGV train line. Passed in 1995, the Barnier Act set up the National Commission of Public Debate (CNDP) to enforce the use of Public Debates on public works that meet the law's requirements.[1] The Debate Public is now part of a wider government initiative to increase public participation on planning projects. Similarly, the Region of  Tuscany  in Italy passed two laws of participation in 2007 and 2013 and announced a region-wide policy of participation. The requirement to hold Public Debates on large-scale public works projects is, like in France, used as a means of realizing the goals of the participation policy. As well, the entire process in Tuscany is overseen by the Authority of the Promotion of Participation which shares many of the same powers and functions as its French counterpart, the CNDP.

Although informal participation takes place outside of political institutions, the kinds of interaction may be the same, including dialogue, deliberation, collaborative decision-making, etc.  Informal participation takes place in the private sphere yet its effects often manifest or influence actions and actors in the public sphere and spaces of political power. The general purposes for which individuals engage in informal participation are:Knowledge sharing  Capacity-building  Social capital and networking  Collective agreements and decision-makingOrigins and DevelopmentKnow how and why this tool/technique was developed? Help uscomplete this section!How it Works  The selection process and targeted demographics depend on the intended purpose of both formal and informal forms of participation. The differences lie in context: informal participation takes place in the private sphere, and is therefore on a much smaller scale. As well, selection techniques such as sampling or the use of randomized-controls are not typically employed (at least not systematically or consciously). Participants are typically chosen from among one’s own social group or become involved through sheer circumstance. One similarity between informal and formal, institutionalized forms of participation, is that they tend to select from among those with a stake in the decisions made or actions taken. Typically, those chosen for participation benefit in some way from the interaction.  Informal forms of participation do not differ significantly from their formal counterparts involving, as they do, dialogue,  deliberation , collaborative engagement, and collective decision making. Where the methods and tools differ is in their context – the private rather than the public or political sphere – and the way they are employed – through trial and error, observation, or intuition rather than formal training or experience in facilitation. Formal participation often takes the form of ‘events’ or pre-planned, structured engagements that follow a set agenda and are overseen and managed by trained facilitators. In contrast, informal participation is often initiated spontaneously or on an as-needed basis throughout the day and, as such, relies on the interpersonal and conversational skills of its participants acquired through socialization.  Examples of informal participation include:An individual seeks out the knowledge of those with similar experiences or, conversely, seeks to gain understanding from those from different backgrounds or social situations  An individual initiates individual- or group-dialogues and debates on issues whose interpretation and understanding is important for both parties.  An individual consults with those with more knowledge or experience before coming to a decision  An individual engages with others (like-minded or otherwise) to gain support for collective action  An individual attempts to convince others through rational, informed persuasion in order to come to a mutually-beneficial or supported decisionAnalysis and Lessons Learned  According to the Community Capacity-Building Framework, community capacity is built and operates through both formal and informal forms and processes of participation and engagement. Community capacity is a fundamentally democratic concept, defined as “the interaction of human capital, organizational resources, and social capital existing within a given community that can be leveraged to solve collective problems and improve or maintain the well-being of that community.”[1] Informal participation contributes to community capacity by building social capital, strengthening individual capabilities, forming networks of trust and collaboration, and increasing knowledge and use of formal channels of public participation.  There is currently scant research on informal forms of participation despite their ubiquity in both the Global North and Global South. In a meta-analysis of 100 studies of citizen engagement in 20 countries, John Gaventa and Gregory Barrett found that civic engagement was conducted through formal channels in only 19% of cases while informal participation – including social movements and campaigns, and local associations – was used in 58%.[2] Not surprisingly, 78% of cases using informal forms of participation were to be found in the least democratic countries where formal channels of engagement are often non-existent, exclusive, and/or provide little political power to participants. ‘Local associations’ is broadly defined by the authors but closely represents informal participation, including processes such as grassroots  community organizing  and membership in neighbourhood or community organizations. However, Gaventa and Barrett’s conclusion that “the importance of local associations as a tool for building citizenship and gaining government responsiveness...is a factor which deserves far more attention” is perhaps no more true than in relation to truly informal, day-to-day uses of participation.[3] Field work and on-the-ground interviews with locals is ongoing so analysis of informal participation is, hopefully, forthcoming.

Summits generally involve several hundred members of the public as well as public officials and stakeholders organizations. Summit organizers typically employ several methods of recruitment to ensure a wide variety of view points are represented. Experts and officials are almost always included and play a supporting role in answering questions of participants or facilitating discussions.  Summits are typically organized to inform citizens on an issue and to gather feedback or proposals. The outcomes of a Summit may be drawn up into a final report and submitted to public officials but any findings or conclusions are generally used for consultation purposes and officials are not bound to act on or implement any of the suggestions or proposals.  Origins and Development  According to a report by Julie Boivin, organizers of the Deux-Montagnes Citizens' Summit, the use of Citizens' Summits dates back to Medieval France when ""it was customary for the king to invite his representatives, the clergy and the population to meet within the confines of one room for the purpose of discussing the kingdom’s financial difficulties. Between 1302 and 1789, when the last Citizen’s Summits (known locally as “États généraux”) were held in France, the king convened the population 16 times. Moreover, the convening of the last Citizen’s Summits coincided with the onset of the French revolution, proof positive that when the population takes part in governmental affairs, events of great magnitude can occur.""

Generally speaking, a Citizens' Initiative Review involves the evaluation of one or more ballot measures by a panel of randomly-selected, demographically-representative sample of citizens. The conclusions of the panel are published as a ""Citizens' Statement"" to give voters a clear, trustworthy resource with which to inform their decisions on the ballot issue.  The CIR has two main objectives:To give citizens a way to render a deliberative, reasoned judgement on political issues, and  To ensure this judgement is heard by voters and officials, thereby amplifying the voice of citizens over the political decision-making process.Like other deliberative, participatory innovations, the CIR improves both the quality and influence of public voice in the democratic process.  Origins and Development  The CIR is derived from the  Citizens' Jury  method of public  deliberation  which has been in use for over 30 years. Ned Crosby, known for his pioneering work on the development and dissemination of the Citizens' Jury method, began work on the CIR in the 1990s. Between 1996 and 2007, Crosby, with his wife and colleague Pat Benn, advocated for the use of the CIR in Washington and Oregon.[1] An early meeting with academics and public officials inspired a 2003 email titled “10 things you can do to improve democracy” that made its way to Elliot Shuford and Tyrone Reitman, then graduate students in public policy at the University of Oregon. In 2006, Reitman and Shuford, with the support of Crosby and Benn, became the co-founders and co-directors of  Healthy Democracy  Oregon - now the official body in charge of the organization and execution of Reviews in the State of Oregon. In June, 2011, the Oregon legislature approved House Bill 2634, making the Citizens’ Initiative Review a permanent part of the Oregon electoral process. While CIRs have been used in other states since then, Oregon is still the only state to formally institutionalize it.  A history of the Citizens' Initiative Review must also acknowledge the development and use of the Citizens' Initiative process - one of the most common methods of direct democracy. The CIR is, technically, used in tandem with the Citizens' Initiative since deliberations are on 'ballot measures': legislative petitions which gain enough signatures to be put to a public vote (a referendum or plebiscite). While the use of Citizens' Initiatives is common in modern democracies, the additional Review process is not.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Once an election has been scheduled on one or more Citizens' Initiatives (ballot measures), the CIR process begins with a random selection of a demographically-representative panel of voters. There is a new panel convened for each measure under review. The number of panelists selected is capped at 24 to ensure deliberation is inclusive and well moderated.[2] An equal number of proponents and opponents to the measures are invited to speak to the panel alongside policy experts. Experts are selected based on their expertise and impartiality on the measure. They are often asked to assist with the drafting of informational material supplied to the panelists before hearing from the speakers.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  All participants - the 24 panelists and the speakers - are brought together for a multi-day review of a single initiative. The panelists undergo training in deliberative techniques and criteria for evaluating information. Following this, the panel hears testimony from the invited speakers. Panelists are encouraged to ask questions and ""probe for information and understanding.""[2] In between speakers, panelists meet in groups or pairs to discuss what they have heard to ""examine the policy trade-offs, costs and benefits, and underlying values."" By deliberating, panelists ""educate one another and distinguish campaign spin from reliable facts.""[2]  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  The final task of the review panel is to write a Citizens’ Statement which includesKey findings  Best reasons to vote for the measure  Best reasons to vote against the measureThe Citizens’ Statement is then included in the statewide Voters Pamphlet and distributed as widely as possible to inform voters prior to the election.[3]  Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this method?

Mapping is a tool that allows community members to visually represent various features such as their values, histories, lived experiences, assets, wants/needs, and relationships. Mapping is often used in participatory planning as a way to get residents to think about what aspects of their community they value and how these can be preserved or strengthened. Mapping is commonly used as a storytelling device since location and geography are essential components of personal history and lived experience.

Unlike other products and services under the banner of 'alternative financial institutions', microfinance typically serves those living in poor countries or communities lacking access to ""high-quality financial products and services, including not just credit but also savings, insurance, payment services, and fund transfers.""[1]  According to the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, the goal of microfinance is to increase the availability of financial services and products to those in poor or socially marginalized societies.[1] Microfinance is a broad category, so there is mixed evidence of its impacts. However, its main intended purpose is to increase or enhance financial inclusion.[2]  Origins and Development  The beginnings of microfinance are attributed to Bangladeshi economist  Muhammad Yunus'  poverty-reducing rural economic programme, which was initially designed as a research project at Chittagong University after the Bangladesh Liberation War in the 1970s.[3] In 1976, Dr. Yunus began issuing 'micro-loans' of $27 (USD) from the bank he founded,  Grameen Bank  (meaning “Village Bank” in Bengali), to women in the village of Jobra; through this lending, he was able to create what he refers to as a virtuous cycle of ""low income, injection of credit, investment, more income, more savings, more investment, more income"".[3]  Yunus' work eventually won him the Nobel Peace Prize and inspired other microfinance organizations and institutions, such as Kiva.[2] Kiva is known for leveraging the power of the internet and online crowdsourcing funds to increase the scale and reach of microfinance services.[2] According to the organization, between their founding in 2005 and 2015, they have ""enabled more than 1.5 million people to fund over 2 million borrowers in over 80 countries [resulting in] nearly $1 billion dollars lent to borrowers and repaid at a rate greater than 97%.""[2]  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Micro-financing institutions are responsible for screening their borrowers, a responsibility assumed by the borrowing group in the case of peer lending.[4] With the original microfinance bank that Professor Yunus began, the vast majority of participants were women living in poverty.[3]  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  There are several methodologies for microfinance depending on the target borrowing group, with the Grameen Bank model among the best known.[5] Some of “the most successful methodologies” use lessons from the traditional financiers for poor individuals, such as moneylenders and middlemen; they offer quick, local access to credit with high interest rates, requiring borrowers to save small amounts, and rely on peer pressure to help self-manage contracts.[6]  Laura Brandt and her co-authors identify two general categories, namely individual lending programs and peer-lending programs.[5] Individual lenders identify individual borrowers based on credit histories, references, and the proposals for how they will spend the money.[5] Individual lending is typically associated with conventional banking systems, which are often reluctant to offer loans to individuals who are unable to make guarantees, thereby excluding the poor.[3] Thus, the uniqueness of Yunus’ innovation is with the short-term loans being given out  without collateral .[7] Instead, they are backed by group guarantee and “borrowers are required to save some amounts”, resulting in high recovery rates while allowing borrowers to escape poverty.[7] Group lending is accompanied by high interest rates, given that it is considered riskier than indiviudal lending.[8]  Group lending can be further divided into two categories: “solidarity group approaches and community-based organization (CBO) approaches” where the difference is that CBOs intend for the borrower group to eventually become independent from lenders, since savings are more central than external funding.[9] The Grameen Bank case illustrates the solidarity model.  According to Brandt et al., the Grameen model begins with the identification of a potential village, training community members on the rules of the program, and groups of five being formed.[9] The self-selected group appoints a leader, which is a rotating role; they then “determine the rotation of access to credit” with timely repayment being a prerequisite for each member to receive a subsequent turn at being the borrower.[10] Loans typically range from $50 to $300.[11] If a member defaults on a loan - that is, they are unable to repay - the other members are held collectively responsible.[10] Thus, repayment is guaranteed through peer pressure, with borrower groups becoming part of the institutional micro-financing structure.[10] They assume some “functions typically performed by bank staff”, such as screening clients to accept into their group.[12]  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Professor Yunus’ original micro-financing bank grew to cover “more than 97 percent of the total villages in Bangladesh” and have “8.93 million [Bangladeshi] borrowers, 97 percent of whom are women” by late 2017.[13] According to Grameen Bank’s official website, external organizations such as the World Bank and Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies have verified the positive impact that microfinance has had on impoverished borrowers.[13] The U.S. government’s volunteer program, Peace Corps, states that “small amounts of cash allow the poor to acquire these assets, increase their productivity, and improve their economic well-being.”[14] For instance, they are enabled to start micro-enterprises with the loans, potentially earning the funds to repay their loan and provide for their families. However, budding entrepreneurs may also encounter low demand in impoverished communities.[17]  Micro-finance has grown not only in Bangladesh, but has been replicated to varying degrees of success in other parts of the world, among them  Ugandaand parts of Latin America. Indian daily newspaper,  The Hindu , reported that microfinance has been “conceptualised and implemented with a high degree of success” in India as well as other developing countries, which often neglect women.[7] Advanced industrial economies such as the U.K. and the U.S. are also implementing microfinance to improve financial inclusion for impoverished communities.[7]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  According to the Norwegian Nobel Prize Committee, microcredit has been a “liberating force in societies where women in particular have to struggle against repressive social and economic conditions.” [15] Microfinance has, after all, shown that “despite high transaction costs and no collateral, in some cases it is possible to lend profitably to low-income households.”[16] Furthermore, Jonathan Morduch suggests that microfinance has lifted the profile of the NGOs involved in organizing and financing the lending.[16] Importantly, he notes that microfinance does not present the solution to destitution, but could aid households below the poverty line; Morduch points to the fact that microfinance drives self-employment, but not necessarily employment generation or overall economic growth, which has a greater influence on living standards.[17]  However, the results have been mixed, with many questioning the positive impacts of microfinance.[18] An article in  The Guardian  points to the South African experience, where “consumption accounts for 94% of microfinance,” noting that this fact suggests the loans will not be repaid.[19] Relatedly, micro-financial institutions have also faced criticism over their high interest rates, with arguments that they exacerbate debt, as well as allegations of coerced payments.[3] A study by Craig McIntosh and Bruce Wydick revealed that growing competition between microfinance institutions in developing countries “yields an equilibrium in which poor borrowers are worse off.”[20]  See AlsoMicrofinance in Uganda   References  [1] Robert Peck Christen, Richard Rosenberg, and Veena Jayadeva, ""Financial Institutions with a 'Double Bottom Line': Implications for the Future of Microfinance,""  Consultative Group to Assist the Poor  (Vol. 8, July 2004):  https://goo.gl/Lim9gp[2] ""What is Microfinance,""  Kiva , accessed February 8, 2019,  https://www.kiva.org/microfinance[3] “Profile: Muhammad Yunus, ‘world’s banker to the poor’”,  BBC News  online, last modified March 2, 2011,  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-11901625[4] “Where Kiva Works,”  Kiva,  accessed February 8, 2019  https://www.kiva.org/about/where-kiva-works[5] Laura Brandt, Natalya Epifanova, and Tatiana Klepikova, “The Russia Microfinance Project”,  University of Washington-Evans School of Public Affairs , accessed February 8, 2019,  https://goo.gl/wfvU9x , 2  [6] “A Microenterprise Training Guide for Peace Corps Volunteers,” Peace Corps, accessed February 8, 2019,  https://files.peacecorps.gov/multimedia/pdf/library/M0068_microent_2-3.pdf  ,  49  [7] “Grameen Bank, a Nobel-winning concept,”  The Hindu , last modified March 24, 2012,  https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/grameen-bank-a-nobelwinning-concept/article3208913.ece   [8] Laura Brandt, Natalya Epifanova, and Tatiana Klepikova, “The Russia Microfinance Project”,  University of Washington-Evans School of Public Affairs , accessed February 8, 2019,  https://goo.gl/wfvU9x , 3  [9] Laura Brandt, Natalya Epifanova, and Tatiana Klepikova, “The Russia Microfinance Project”,  University of Washington-Evans School of Public Affairs , accessed February 8, 2019,  https://goo.gl/wfvU9x , 4-5  [10] Laura Brandt, Natalya Epifanova, and Tatiana Klepikova, “The Russia Microfinance Project”,  University of Washington-Evans School of Public Affairs , accessed February 8, 2019,  https://goo.gl/wfvU9x , 6  [11] “A Microenterprise Training Guide for Peace Corps Volunteers,”  Peace Corps,  accessed February 8, 2019,  https://files.peacecorps.gov/multimedia/pdf/library/M0068_microent_2-3.pdf , 52  [12] Charles Waterfield, and Ann Duval, “CARE Savings and Credit Sourcebook”, CARE, 1996.

Their ""rediscovery"" in modern times has led to an important decolonization of local and community management in order to pursue genuine self-determination. The implementation of these systems often requires the approval (and, in some less ideal cases) oversight by ""sovereign"" (colonial) government officials. Typically, the indigenous system of governance is used as the basis for more inclusive regulatory frameworks for environmental and food governance over a presiding resource or biodiversity system. While the basic framework of an indigenous management system is generalizable, it is (ideally) context dependent and conforms to local historical, social-cultural, political-economic, and ontological contexts.  Modern ""reinstatement"" of these systems may involve the institutionalization (recognition of jurisdiction by colonial/settler governments) of indigenous governance and direct indigenous collaborative deliberation over land-use, practice, and distribution by affected community members. It builds off of longstanding traditional cultural practices, knowledge and ‘adapts’ them to the contemporary realities of the resource in question and the communities involved to create a more non-antagonistic, inclusive, and effective environmental regulation.  Origins and Development  Some indigenous systems of government date back hundreds of years. The North American Six Nations Iriquois - encompassing numerous Nations (indigenous groups) continue to practice a form of participatory democracy developed over 800 years ago.[1] Similarly, the Oromo people of Ethiopia have used the ' Gadaa ' system of deliberative decision-making and community governance since the 15thC (approx.).[2]  Participant Recruitment and SelectionKnow how participants are recruited for this method? Help uscomplete this section!How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  An example of a traditional, indigenous system of governance is the  Ethiopian Qero Management System .""Rediscovered"" after hundreds of years, this collaborative and participatory form of environmental sustainability and conservation practice led by indigenous groups has now been adopted by the state for local management of the Gaussa-Menz grasslands.  Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsKnow what outcomes and effects this method typically has? Help uscomplete this section!Analysis and Lessons Learned  There has been renewed interest in indigenous led forms of resource management and environmental conservation by policy practitioners and as outlined in the background papers for the United Nations post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals. This has coincided with an increase in visibility – largely through the efforts of independent media, scholars, activists, and NGOs – of indigenous led social movements to re-appropriate resources and trusteeship, from corporations and governments, over the environments in which they live and depend. Given the realities of indigenous sovereignty within states, methods that allow indigenous communities to deliberate and form regulatory controls/institutions based on local knowledge, tradition, history, social-cultural, and political-economic contexts, become necessary for effective democratic and environmental governance.

L2L aims to establish ongoing dialogues between marginalised women and local decision-making authorities.  Through this process, ""women negotiate a range of development issues, priorities, plans, and programs in ways that enhance community participation and address women’s priorities"". [1]  L2L Dialogues combines women's marginalisation with social change and thus, supports grassroots women in taking active and meaningful impact in the planning and decision making processes on issues that affect their lives and families.  Origins and Development  The Local-to-Local (L2L) Dialogues methodology was first experimented with in South Asia between 1999 and 2000, primarily as a model for grassroots political participation. As a concept, it materialised from the discussions of Society for the Promotion of Area Resource Centres (SPARC) and Swayam Shikshan Prayog (SSP) who are experts in  community organizing  and women’s advocacy. However, Asia Women and Shelter Networks (AWAS) was the first to apply the concept as a political participatory strategy within the South Asia region.[2]Perhaps, with success with its application, the  United Nations  Human Settlement Program (UN-HABITAT) supported the Huairou Commission (a global coalition that promotes the capacity of grassroots women leaders in development and policy-making) to conduct a pilot project with this model on six countries — Argentina, Czech Republic, Kenya, Russia, Tanzania and Uganda — in 2002.  The pilot studies exemplified the effectiveness of the methodology in opening up new democratic space for cooperative effort and building relationships among grassroots women and local leaders.[3] By the time  GROOTS Kenya picked this strategy  in April 2007 for its “Women’s Leadership and Governance” Program, L2L Dialogues was already being used in over twenty countries across Latin America, Europe, West Africa, and sparingly in India.

The methodology was developed in South Australia by  DemocracyCo , a professional deliberative practitioner and facilitator organisation, and a group of stakeholders, made up of government, business, and public service representatives. The process consists of a panel of citizens working collaboratively and deliberatively with experts and stakeholders to develop a policy together over the course of four days. The first use of The People’s Policy was the  development of a child well-being policy in South Australia . Central to this approach, and a departure from previous mini-public approaches in the state is that the process is entirely non-partisan and independent from government, and the policy issue is identified and developed by citizens.  DemocracyCo, the initiators of The People’s Policy, identified a constellation of problems underpinning the need for a citizen-led approach to policy making. Australia is facing a crisis of trust in politics, with trust in politicians in steep decline[1]. Whilst trust and participations in politics is at a low ebb, increasingly complex problems demand complex policy solutions. In an attempt to gain the interest and engagement of citizens, short-term and simplistic policy options are presented by politicians as feasible answers: ‘the problem is that it is a short-term solution because simple solutions don’t and won’t ever solve the complex challenges facing our society’[2].  The People’s Policy aims to provide long-term policy solutions to complex problems that are developed by citizens rather than politicians, and that are not tainted by party politics. The purpose of The People’s Policy is to develop policy through a combination of facilitated deliberation and public input[3]. Underscoring this approach is a desire for the public to develop and actually write policies, ‘turning the system inside out’[4].  The approach is non-partisan and led by citizens and experts working together to set the agenda and develop a policy. The aim of this approach is to develop long-term policy solutions to complex problems that are not the domain of party politics and not subject to the short-termism of electoral campaign promises. The first  People’s Policy on child wellbeing  was timed to be introduced to political parties in the run-up to the state elections in March 2018, to provide an antidote to this. The end policy was presented to all political parties and all parties are invited to meet with panel members and adopt the policy in whole or in part.  Origins and Development  South Australia has a strong record for engaging citizens in decision-making and has convened a number of extensive consultation programs and deliberative mini-publics. However, these processes are typically convened by the state government under Labor Premier Jay Weatherill. In addition, policymakers and politicians set the policy issue or agenda in advance and ask citizens, in the form of a citizens jury and wider engagement process, to make collective decisions or recommendations to the government.  The People’s Policy stands apart from this in its non-partisan approach and having citizens and stakeholders identify the agenda and develop the content themselves. The process is funded by a range of organisations and stakeholders who are invested in the specific policy issue. In the case of The People’s Policy on Child Wellbeing, this was a group of non-profit and community organisations committed to child welfare, as well as DemocracyCo.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Central to this approach is citizens working closely with experts and stakeholders relevant to a given policy area. Citizens were recruited through a combination of self-selection and random stratification. The opportunity to participate can be advertised through  social media , local radio and other networks. Out of those who express interest, a random stratified sample is taken to reflect demographic characteristics. In The People’s Policy on Child Wellbeing, an initial sample of 200 citizens resulted in a panel of 38 people following stratification. The ultimate aim regarding participation selection is to achieve a random, stratified sample of citizens. This is dependent on funding, however, since recruitment usually carries a high price tag.  Experts are also invited to give evidence and talk to citizen participants more informally.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  A range of tools and techniques were used during the People’s Policy on Child Wellbeing. The tools used will likely vary according to the topic and structure of future uses of the method. The People’s Policy involves a combination of in-person facilitated  deliberation  and an  online  portal for panel members to continue conversations. Citizen Panellists meet for a total of four days over a three month period. The in-person deliberations were also open to the wider public for people to come and observe the process.  Techniques may include:Briefing and induction processes - to allow participants to meet and greet and aso to brieff them on the topic being considered  Facilitated  workshops  - facilitated by a deliberative facilitator including consensus techniques  Evidence consideration from business, industry, government, community and academic sources from jurisdictions all over the worlds  Self managed work and advocacy - research study groups, surveying of friends and family members  Interviews and conversations with people affected / impacted  Online platforms to support out-of-session deliberation  Celebration events at key milestones  Requirement of participants to be advocates for the work.As well as the policy being citizen-led, the same approach is also used for the process itself,‘where panel members influenced the way in which they spent their time together. This resulted in them creating a ‘master plan’ for their policy document, working in small writing and conversational groups, at times having consensus conversations culminating in them convening a small writing group to refine the final policy 5 document’[5]. For the People’s Policy on child wellbeing, this citizen-led approach also entailed the panel developing a  survey  for the wider community to help refine their thinking. Participants shared the survey through their own networks and the results were used to help finalise the final policy document.  Participants also hear from a wide range of experts during the process, in a variety of formats. As well as formal presentations to the panel, more intimate interactions take place through small group conversations. The aim is for panelists to hear from a broad range of perspectives within a relatively short period of time in order to build knowledge on the topic and have the opportunity to question and challenge experts.  In-person deliberations are supported by a group of volunteers recruited and managed by DemocracyCo. For the People’s Policy on child wellbeing, there were volunteer counselors on hand to provide pastoral support for participants as they were exposed to harrowing evidence related to the issue at hand.  Given this citizen-led approach, it’s feasible that during future iterations of The People’s Policy, the precise process should vary as it is determined to a large extent by the participants needs themselves.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  The end product from The People’s Policy is a policy document - produced by the citizen panelists that provides a comprehensive, long-term policy position in a format ready for government to adopt. This document is intended to be more detailed and in-depth than the final report produced by a  citizens jury , because the aim is for the citizens to actually write policy, rather than give a set of recommendations or decisions on an already proposed policy. The end policy is then presented to all political parties (in SA, six political parties). Panel members also meet with their local representatives to discuss the policy and advocate their work through media and community networks.  Given that the first use of this approach has just published its policy, we don’t have any information about the wider influence and effects such as policy adoption and implementation. DemocracyCo, who instigated and led the first case, hope that the People’s Policy will be used by others in the future.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The method is currently being evaluated by the  Jefferson Center’s Kyle Bozentko  and a report will be made available at the earliest date. The evaluation will help establish whether the People’s Policy is an effective method of democratic innovation both in terms of citizen participation and policy outcomes.  Despite the lack of concrete analysis, it is worth noting that the People’s Policy marks a departure from previous approaches to deliberative mini-publics in Australia in that it is non-partisan, not funded or instigated by government, and utilises a citizen-led approach to identifying and developing a comprehensive policy. Whilst previous mini-publics have been organised independent from government in Australia (e.g.  Australian Citizens’ Parliament ), this is the first approach developed and led entirely by a practitioner organisation. It is also unique in the focus on developing a comprehensive policy.

 ""Experimentalist democracy"" -- sometimes called ""experimental democracy"" -- is a method of participatory governance described by John Dewey in ""The Public and Its Problems"" and Elizabeth Anderson in  ""The Epistemology of Democracy,""in which citizens and public officials deliberate together in an iterative process to identify and address public problems. In experimentalist democracy, citizens and public officials meet regularly to deliberate in order to identify public problems, devise policies to address those problems, implement the policies, examine and evaluate the consequences of those policies, develop improvements to the policies, implement the improved policies, examine and evaluate the consequences of the improved policies, and so on. 
 Problems and Purpose 
 According to Dewey, in the U.S. in the early twentieth century, many public officials had lost touch with ordinary citizens, and many citizens had begun to feel alienated from the state and from their local communities. As a result of these circumstances, many public policies lacked effectiveness because they were not informed by knowledge of local conditions, and many communities lacked cohesion. Experimentalist democracy has the potential to address these problems. Citizens' participation in policy development, evaluation, and reform introduces citizens' rich knowledge of local circumstances into the policy process, leading to more effective policies that are likely to become still more effective over time. In addition, citizens' regular participation in policy deliberation with their neighbors, as well as with public officials, is likely to increase citizens' social ties with their local community and their identification with that community, and their sense of the relevance of and need for the state. Further, the need to identify criteria for evaluating policies is likely to cause citizens to acquire a greater understanding of and concern for the public interest. 
 History 
 Examples of experimentalist democracy include the  Community Score Cardmethod of participatory program evaluation developed by CARE,  Community Forestry Groupsdescribed by Agarwal (2000, 2001) and Anderson (2006),  Ecosystem-Based Management ,  community-based ecosystem management (Bliss et al., 2001; Gray, Enzer, &amp; Kusel, 2001; Gray, Fisher, &amp; Jungwirth, 2001), and the embedded funding approach to community philanthropy (Allen-Meares et al., 2011). 
 Participant Selection 
 In the descriptions of experimentalist democracy by Dewey and Anderson, the mode of participant selection is not specified. Dewey suggests that the mode is self-selection, as deliberation about public problems arises naturally among neighbors in the course of daily interactions in local communities, and that public officials come to participate in these interactions on a regular basis. 
 Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction 
 In Dewey's and Anderson's accounts, in experimentalist democracy citizens' interactions with each other and with public officials are characterized by deliberation, in identifying public needs, designing and choosing policy solutions, evaluating the consequences of implemented policies, and devising reforms to those policies in light of those consequences. The image is generally of citizens deliberating together in their local communities, with the participation of public officials. In Dewey's and Anderson's accounts, the precise methods of decision making are not specified. 
 Influence, Outcomes, and Effects 
 As described by Dewey and Anderson, experimentalist democracy is expected to have a number of desirable outcomes. These include more effective public policies -- because policies are informed by citizens' knowledge of how public problems and policy consequences manifest in local communities -- improved social outcomes in local communities, increased social capital and a heightened sense of community identity among citizens, a greater sense among citizens of the relevance of the state, augmented political efficacy among citizens, and, for citizens, an enhanced understanding of and concern for the public interest. 
 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 To date, analyses of experimentalist democracy appear to be limited in number. The implementation of experimentalist democracy in the Community Score Card method of participatory program evaluation has been evaluated in a series of empirical studies, described in  the Participedia case study of that method  . Results of those studies indicate that many of the expected desirable outcomes of experimentalist democracy can be realized in practice, but that implementation of experimentalist democracy also entails several challenges. These include needs for effective facilitation and for extensive preparation in order to take into account context-specific factors influencing deliberation in local communities, practical difficulties of administering evaluative criteria devised by citizens, the demands imposed on citizens by the deliberative process, and the difficulty of engaging regional or national governments in the development of policies to address problems that have substantial local consequences but that are regional, national, or international in scope.

[6] Community forestry is at times characterized as a forest-specific instance of a broader method called community-based ecosystem management [7][8][9] or  Ecosystem-based Management .  Researchers have identified at least two main problems that community forestry aims to address: the degradation of forests, and the perception that members of local forest communities lacked a meaningful role in the governance of those forests.[7][3] The main goals of community forestry include involving members of local communities in the management of local forests, in order to improve the sustainability of the forests.[7] Additional goals include enabling members of local communities to meet their basic needs, reducing social conflict, facilitating ""community learning,"" fostering ""public dialogue about ... natural resources"" more generally [10], and spurring local economic growth.[3]  Origins and Development  The most recent wave of community-forestry projects seems to have begun in the 1980s, and was spurred partly by grassroots efforts, partly by governments, and partly by national or global foundations or nonprofit organizations. In parts of Asia and Africa, community forestry was initiated by government policies, such as joint forest management programs in Tanzania and India [2][3] and ""Nepal's community forestry program"" which encouraged the formation of ""forest user groups"".[11] In Asia, Africa, and the United States, national or international nonprofit organizations and foundations — such as the  Ford Foundation , CARE, and Farm Africa — initiated a number of community forestry projects. These included Ford's ""Community-Based Forestry Demonstration Program (CBFDP)"" in the U.S., the ""Action Research into Poverty Impacts of Participatory Forest Management (ARPIP) project,"" in which Ford cooperated with ""CARE ... and national partners ... in Kenya, Tanzania and Nepal"",[12][13] and  the Participatory Forest Management program in Ethiopia  organized by Farm Africa and a local nonprofit organization.[14] Further, some community-forestry projects in several nations arose from grassroots efforts of citizens and local nonprofits.[2][3] In addition, in some nations, recent community-forestry efforts have built on pre-existing forms of participatory forestry, such as  vanpanchayatsintroduced in parts of India during the colonial period.[11]  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Methods of participant selection seem to vary among community forestry projects. Although in many projects the method seems to be self-selection with all community members welcome, some programs restrict membership in various ways. For example, in parts of India, laws or policies restrict participation in some community-forestry groups to one or two household members, which substantially limits participation by women.[1][2] In addition, some community-forestry groups are organized in two tiers, with a lower tier featuring more open participant selection and an upper tier or ""executive committee"" chosen by a more restrictive method, such as election.[15]  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Patterns of  deliberation , decision making, and public interaction also vary considerably among community-forestry projects. In some groups, facilitators aim to enable inclusive discussion that seeks to integrate multiple perspectives on issues, both in policy making and in monitoring of implemented policies.[16][3][17] In the monitoring activities of some projects, local community members are encouraged to participate in the evaluation of implemented policies, and their contributions inform reforms to policies in a cycle of adaptive decision making and management. [16][18][19][20] Reports indicate that local norms play a substantial role in patterns of deliberation and decision making in some community-forestry groups. For example, in India and Nepal, women are often marginalized from discussions and decision making in community-forestry groups, by means of sex-segregated seating, hostility toward women participants, and denigration or disregard of their comments.[1]  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  The consequences of community-forestry have been mixed. Positive effects identified by McDermott and Schreckenberg (2009, p. 166 unless otherwise noted) include:“restoration of forest health” (also noted by [25])  Improved “ecosystem services” of forests  “inclusive new social fora"" (also noted by Glasmeier &amp; Farrigan, 2005, p. 63)  “the representation of marginalised groups""  “improved local governance”  “improved … community capacity"", including voice and “decision-making power or influence"" [21]  improvements in participants’ “skills, knowledge and health” and “social capital” [22]  “reduction of conflict”  “collaborative relationships with government agencies and other external groups”  improved “community infrastructure and government services”  greater economic development [22]  desirable regional or national policy reforms [23]The following additional desirable consequences of community forestry have been reported:greater access to forest resources [10]  better forest management due to consideration of citizens’ local knowledge in policy development and implementation [1][2][5]  job creation, and, in some instances, higher incomes [25][22]  reduced outmigration from forest areas [25][26]Researchers have also noted the following qualifications or deleterious effects of community forestry:Measuring the effects of community forestry is often difficult because many effects take the form of “non-market exchange interactions""; at times multiple community forestry efforts operate in a single community and interact with each other, many projects have quite long time-frames, most studies of community forestry use only qualitative methods, and reports of quantitative data often concern inputs only, and no outputs [24]  Validating reported results of many community-forestry projects is difficult because of ""[in]sufficient reporting practices and the lack of replicability of project designs"" [24]  Low-income members of forest communities ""may be made worse off"" by community-forestry projects,[21] but those members' likelihood of benefiting from community-forest projects increases to the extent that they have proportional membership in the project’s decision-making groups[13][27]  Community-forestry projects may increase inequality[28][22]  “Community forestry is often better at improving conditions for poor communities as a whole than for the poorest within communities” [6]  Community-forestry projects often create ""positive change at community and higher levels, rather than by delivering benefits directly to poor and marginalised households” [29]  Many community-forestry projects show little to no direct economic benefits to the local community [24]  Many community-forestry groups ""fail to take off"" or are ""unable to sustain their gains""[25]  Violations of forest rules and ineffective rule enforcement are common [1][2]  Some community-forestry rules have been criticized for being unfair, illegitimate, inefficient, or too restrictive [1][2]  Women and individuals from marginalized groups are often excluded from community-forestry projects,[1][2] although the formation of informal and formal women-only groups has helped to increase the inclusion of women in some areas [30]Analysis and Lessons Learned  Community-forestry projects seem more likely to alleviate poverty and reduce inequality in a community when improving the conditions of poor and marginalized community members is an explicit project goal from the outset, and when those members have substantial representation in the project’s decision-making groups.[23]  Desirable outcomes of community-forestry projects are more likely to materialize when the project is facilitated by an effective external project-management organization [31] or an equivalent entity (such as “a knowledgeable and politically astute internal champion …and/or collaborative learning group”), in part because community-forestry projects often involve considerable institutional and social complexity.[23]  The success of community-forestry projects generally requires “the commitment of adequate [government] resources”[31], and often requires other actions or policy changes by government agencies that vary from setting to setting.[31]  See AlsoParticipatory Forest Management in Ethiopia: Bonga Case StudyForestry Communities in Petén, GuatemalaReferences  [1] Agarwal, B.

 Government and regulatory bodies often issue a ‘Notice and Request for Public Comment’ (NRPC) to solicit feedback on proposed regulations, laws, and amendments. NRPCs are predominantly used by government departments and agencies as well as public oversight or regulatory bodies. In the United States, the Administrative Procedures Act (1946) requires all Federal agencies submit regulation proposals for public comment before they can be written into law.[1] The NRPC is widely used outside the United States but is often referred to simply as ‘public consultation’ while more participatory forms of consultations are referred to by their title such as citizens’ jury or public hearing.[2] 
 A Notice and Request for Public Comment is used to solicit public feedback on proposed laws or regulations. Public commenting periods are widely used in representative democracy as a way to increase transparency in the policy making process.[3] As well, the solicitation of feedback legitimises policy by giving citizens voice and agency in the process. The resulting policy can thus claim to represent or reflect citizens' views. Policy makers are not, however, legally obliged to adopt or act on any public commentary although they must respond to it in a final report.[4] 
 Origins and Development 
 According to a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, “Notice-and-comment has a long history in some OECD countries, and its use has become much more widespread in recent years. It was first adopted for lower-level regulations in the United States in 1946. The practice was subsequently adopted in Canada in 1986 – called “pre-publication” – and in Portugal in 1991. By 1998, 19 OECD countries were using public notice-and-comment at least in some situations. Japan adopted notice-and-comment requirements for all new regulatory proposals (and revisions to existing rules) in April 1999. In other countries such as Hungary, the process is proceeding on an ad hoc basis, with individual Ministries deciding their own policies.”[5] 
 Participant Recruitment and Selection 
 As its name suggests, the request for public comment is open to all members of the public. The 'notice' or 'request' for comment is typically posted by the issuing body on government message boards - either online or in public spaces such as Town Halls or administrative centres.[6] As Graham Smith notes, “[o]pen forms of consultation tend to attract citizens who already have a strong political interest.”[7] The number and type of people who comment are heavily dependent on the topic of the regulation or policy. Because there is often little effort on the part of the issuing bodies to attract a larger or more diverse audience, topics which provoke widespread contention, which affect a large number of people, or which attract a vocal opposition will continue to draw the most comments. 
 Non-governmental organizations which promote public oversight and accountability play a role in promoting notices and requests for public comment. Organisations such as the Public Comment Project and the Project on Government Oversight (formerly the Center for Effective Government) have adopted the communicative power of information and communications technology to disseminate NRPCs.[8] For example, the Public Comment Project uses the Twitter hashtag #pubcomm [9] and the Project on Government Oversight offers email alerts.[10] Government websites tend not to advertise NRPCs but aid in public participation by posting NRPCs, collecting comments (or detailing how to comment), and providing final reports.[11] 
 How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making 
 The public commenting process does not, typically, involve deliberation or, indeed, negotiation. As far as channels of citizen engagement go, public commenting is very uni-directional: the public posts their comments but, in general, they do not hear back until the final report is issued. The reception - but not the adoption - of all comments must be documented by the soliciting entity in the final report. The depth of response varies but, in general, detailed or lengthy explanation is only given to those final decisions which go against the views expressed in the comments.[12] 
 Like the number of people that participate, the amount of interaction between citizens and officials is heavily dependent on the amount of public interest and the visibility of the process. Many regulations pass the public commenting period with little to no public involvement.[13] In general, policy or regulatory proposals which deal with highly contentious subjects or which have the potential to affect a large number of people attract the greatest public participation. 
 Commenting can be done through a variety of means depending on the issuing body. Most NRPCs issues by federal government departments and agencies in can be found and/or commented on on a central website. For example, the following websites keep an up-to-date list of all policies and regulations open for public commenting: regulations.gov in the USA, canada.ca/consultingcanadians in Canada, and gov.uk in the United Kingdom. The ease-of-use varies significantly across platforms. regulations.gov has a built-in commenting function for most notices but canada.ca/consultingcanadians offers little information on how to comment. In most cases, it is necessary to visit the specific agency or department website. It should be noted that many countries list Notices and Requests for Public Comment on their consultation website and thus do not distinguish between ‘deep’ and ‘shallow’ forms of engagement. Public commenting is one of the most shallow forms of public engagement since there is little effort put into recruitment, participation is non-deliberative, and final decisions are left to the issuing bodies.[14]Influence, Outcomes, and Effects 
 Most government bodies required to submit regulations and policies to public comment are also required to respond to those comments in a final report.[15] Independent groups or organisations that solicit public comments on rule changes likewise often commit to some form of response.[16] The effect of public commenting alone is difficult to measure. Organised, concerted citizen efforts to change or influence regulatory decisions often involve multiple methods of government engagement and communication such as petitions, demonstrations, and lobbying. It is unlikely that public commenting alone can affect much change in policy although it does force legislative bodies to justify decisions which go against the majority of comments received.[17] 
 For governments, the public commenting period and its recognition in the final report are often used to justify or legitimise the proposed policy. Having open consultations with the public demonstrates a government’s willingness to at least listen to citizen opinions and concerns.[18] 
 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 The Notice and Request for Public Comment is a non-deliberative, open method of public consultation. The following ‘broad conclusions’ drawn by Graham Smith are thus applicable: 
 Open forms of consultation tend to attract citizens who already have a strong political interest; whereas more statistically representative techniques tend to lack depth. “The relationship between consultation and decision-making is not always clear and feedback is rarely provided. 
 There is often widespread scepticism that consultation is being used to legitimate decisions that have already been made.” Reassuringly, however, Smith notes the following: “Standard techniques for eliciting public opinion on services and policies can be used in highly creative and innovative ways. 
 More innovative approaches offer interesting developments but they will only be effective if citizens believe that public authorities are genuinely committed to engagement. 
 The best consultation exercises are run independently of government reducing suspicion of manipulation by authorities.” [19] The standard form of NRPC - non-deliberative, not widely publicised, difficult to navigate and/or participate - is, in many countries, being supplemented with ‘deeper’ forms of public consultation and participation such as Town Halls, focus groups, and initiative reviews. The ability to comment on policy is still an important feature of policy making but, as it stands, it could be improved.

Facebook Live allows a live broadcast of up to four hours, and the video stays up on the site afterwards so people can watch the recorded version. The video can be removed by the uploader or by Facebook if it is deemed to break guidelines. The broadcaster can also customise their audience to some extent.  Facebook Live can be used for a variety of purposes. As discussed below, it has been used to enhance visibility of state or police persecution and help activists spread messages. As a public engagement tool, it can be used by government agencies or other public organisations to engage with a large audience.  Governments and public sector organisations have used Facebook Live to stream press conferences and events, take an audience ‘behind the scenes’ of an agency’s work and get across important messages [2].  The precise aims of a broadcast will vary in practice, and for a government agency may include:Provide information about an important issue  Stream proceedings from an event like a public meeting or conference  Engage constituents who might not usually attend a public meeting [3]  Initiate a discussion about a specific issue  Show an audience how an agency works day-to-day, show ‘behind the scenes or help ‘humanise’ the work of an organisation [2]Facebook has sought maintain an ‘apolitical’ stance as a platform, stating that any politician may use Facebook and Facebook Live. This question was raised after the platform hosted Barack Obama for a  Town Hall  Meeting [4]. At this time, Facebook Live was not available to all users and Facebook itself hosted live broadcasts.  Origins and Development  Facebook itself has been used as a platform and resource for participation, protest and organisation, most notably during the Arab Spring uprisings as in the  February 20 Movement in Morocco , and by the Occupy Movement. In these contexts, Facebook and other social media platforms provide a way to organise and coordinate mass demonstrations and a way for activists to communicate. However, it is worth noting that video uploads have also been a feature of these movements. During the Arab Spring, mainstream media and international journalists were often censored, and social media and video uploads became an outlet to let the rest of the world know what was happening, and for demonstrators to spread their message. Social media also enabled ‘democracy advocates’ to connect with others beyond national boundaries [5].  Thus, live streaming and video uploads are not necessarily new, unique to Facebook or to public engagement. Streaming of public meetings and participatory processes, as well as political debates and conferences is not unusual. For example, the  South Australia Citizens’ Jury on nuclear fuel storage  was filmed and videos uploaded by the state government for wider viewing.  Facebook live launched in 2016. Previously, the service had been available but not to all users [2]. It is distinct as it is now available to all Facebook users, is embedded within the Facebook platform (previous live streaming offers were standalone applications) and has a range of tools to help manage and track broadcasts [3].  Live has been to used stream police violence and shootings in the United States [6]. The streaming of videos such as  the shooting of Philando Castile  can be seen as making an important contribution to democratic debate and participation. These videos enhance representation of incidents that might otherwise remain hidden from public view [7]. They thus may help raise such issues higher on the public agenda and enhance calls for the responsible authorities to be held accountable for their actions.  Live has also been used to record violent crimes as they occur, streamed by perpetrators [8] Facebook is unable to monitor content sufficiently as it streams, meaning that such videos can amass a large audience before they are removed.  How it Works  The audience of a Facebook Live video will be primarily self-selecting: those Facebook users who already follow the person or page broadcasting are most likely to engage. However, it is also possible that a broadcast might reach a wider audience than those already engaged or interested in the issue, as is the case with most self-selecting forms of political participation. Anecdotally,  a budgetary hearing in Canada recently received a larger audience than expected for their live stream , suggesting that the audience for a Facebook Live broadcast could be broader than those who might normally be motivated to participate.  In the past, watching a video broadcast was conceived of as a passive activity [9]. By contrast, Facebook Live enables some degree of interaction and communication. Viewers can ‘react’ to the video as it streams and the broadcaster can see and respond to these reactions in real time. ‘Reactions’ on Facebook come in the form of a set of emojis representing a limited range of emotions: like, love, angry, sad and laughing. Viewers can also comment on the video and interact with each other as well the broadcaster being able to respond to comments and questions during the broadcast.Facebook provides guidelines  for those wishing to successfully use Facebook Live in order to engage an audience. These include letting people know in advance when you will be live, ensuring a good internet connection, enticing viewers with engaging descriptions, and signposting others to where they can watch the video afterwards.  The extent to which communication and interaction actually occurs during Facebook Live broadcast is unclear. There is little research focussing on Facebook Live and whilst a number of blogs and sites enthusiastically recommend it as an important way for governments to engage better and with a wider audience [3, 2], significantly more research is needed to evaluate the extent to which this form of communication is effective.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Whilst there is a considerable body of research on the use of Facebook and social media and democratic activism, particularly regarding the Arab Spring, evidence is less forthcoming on Facebook Live specifically. It is therefore unclear what kind of influence Facebook Live broadcasts might have on public decisions, public debate, community awareness or engagement with government. There is little to no established empirical evidence available to fully evaluate Facebook Live as a tool for participation and engagement. However, there are some possible advantages and disadvantages that are worth considering.  Facebook is the biggest social media platform in the world – there are clearly a lot of people on Facebook [10]. Whilst this is no guarantee of a massive audience, the way the platform works is to ‘reward engagement’ – the more people engage with content, the more other users are directed to it. This is because Facebook pages gain most likes from users when their Facebook friends like that page [4]. Producing high quality Facebook Live broadcasts can ‘drive’ more traffic towards an organisation or individual’s page, thus growing the potential audience [10]. This may lead to engaging a broader audience than those who might normally engage with government or public organisations – although again, greater evidence is required for this.  On the downside, despite its massive user base, the audience for Facebook Live is limited to that user base. It is not possible to view Facebook Live broadcasts without a Facebook account [10]. This raises further questions about the type of audience reached through Facebook and Live. Matthew Crozier, founder of online deliberation platform  Bang the Table , suggests that although Facebook is viewed as a way to reach a younger audience [10], more young people are moving away from Facebook as older generations begin to join [11].  Importantly, Crozier points out that Facebook favours simplistic content and style, suggesting that this might not be the best format to communicate potentially complex messages on nuanced issues. This is exacerbated by the huge amount of content on Facebook that a broadcast must compete with [11].  Finally, it is worth remembering that Facebook is a for-profit enterprise that uses users’ data and preferences to drive and change consumer behaviour and perhaps also political behaviour [12]. It is therefore not a neutral space but is open to influence from advertisers that can influence how users interact and engage with Facebook Live. Ultimately, more research is needed into how this marketised environment is used as a tool for public engagement.  See AlsoSocial mediaReferences  [1] Nolfi, T.

 A Twitter chat is an online conversation held on  Twitter , focusing on a topic and linked together through the use of a specific hashtag [1] which enables people to follow what is being said and join in. Twitter chats can be used by anyone including businesses and celebrities but have also been utilised as a public engagement tool on topics such as public health. 
 A Twitter chat is usually initiated by a specific organisation or individual, and those who join can ask questions or comment on the topic at hand. This facilitates interaction between a broader public and the organiser, although there is no obligation to respond to all tweets in the chat. Furthermore, a Twitter chat also involves interaction and exchange between other participants  [2] . The chat is usually held at a designated time, chosen to optimise the number of participants and engagement. 
 The purpose of a Twitter Chat will vary according to the needs of the organiser. For example, public health organisations use Twitter and other social media as a means of providing reliable and up-to-date information which is particularly pertinent during a disease outbreak  [3] . Other purposes may centre on community building or activism  [4] . 
 Origins and Development 
 Twitter is a social media platform where individuals can register as users either as individuals or as organisations, and share short messages. The use of hashtags makes a word clickable and searchable, enabling users to follow tweets by topics by following the hashtag. Twitter chats are organised around a hashtag. 
 Twitter has been around since 2006, and Twitter chats seem to have emerged as a concept shortly after, although this is not entirely clear. Academic research evaluating the use of Twitter chats emerged several years later. From a rudimentary search on Google Scholar, a large amount of academic research on Twitter chats focuses on public health, medical practice and education. Notable examples include Twitter chats held during the Ebola and Zika virus epidemics  [4 ,  5] . 
 How it Works 
 Participants in a Twitter chat are self-selecting, although usually they will be made of a community of practice or community of interest  [2]  – people interested in, working in or invested in the topic of the chat. In theory, any number of Twitter users could join a chat. The number in practice will likely depend on the timing of the event, interest in the topic at the time, and is of course limited to those who use Twitter in the first place. 
 The nature of Twitter is asymmetric, in that there is no obligation for a user to ‘follow back’ someone that follows them  [2] . Thus, on the standard Twitter feed, users will only see tweets from the users that they follow. However, in a Twitter chat the discussion is oriented around the chosen hashtag, so that a participant can follow the hashtag and view all the tweets pertaining to it – regardless of who follows who. 
 Conversation in a Twitter chat is relatively free flowing, since the host cannot control what other people tweet, although their responses can augment the chat. Interaction during a Twitter chat can be between the initiator and participants and between participants. Megele (2014) defines Twitter chat as a form of multilogue – many to many communication. That is to say, each tweet can be read by multiple users and may receive multiple replies from different users. She argues that this allows multiple strands of discourse to emerge and develop as ‘a broader range of participants contribute simultaneously’  [2, p.47] . This can result in a broader discussion with a loose structure that does not follow the usual ‘turn-taking’ of a discussion in person. Within this multi-way communication however, two-way conversations can also occur, where two users pursue a conversation to the exclusion of other participants chiming in  [2] . 
 Twitter chat hosts also have the freedom to ignore or exclude certain users or issues raised during the chat, and thus shape the scope and direction of the conversation, to a limited extent. For example, chats run by public health organisations on the Ebola and Zika outbreaks failed to respond to concerns about the risk to pregnant women and newborns. This could either be interpreted as an attempt to focus on what the organiser (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) saw as the most important issues only, or that the host simply didn’t pick up on this issue as a topic of major public concern  [3] . 
 Despite having an organiser or host, a Twitter chat is not facilitated by a moderator or anyone monitoring the conversation, although there are tools that can be used to analyse the engagement. There are also some suggested guidelines to follow to host a Twitter chat. These include carefully selecting a time when the most people are likely to participate to maximise engagement, inviting relevant people and organisations to join the chat, promoting the event, and using a specific tool to manage the chat such as  TweetChat  to help manage the chat  [6] . 
 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 There is limited empirical evidence on how effective Twitter chats are a form of public engagement and communication  [4] . Findings so far suggest that the effectiveness of Twitter chats as an engagement tool can depend largely on the host/organiser and the aim of the chat. Multiple organisers of a chat in New Orleans focused on facilitating an open discussion about the culture around health in the city, with different organisers showing different levels of engagement with participants  [4] . As with studies mentioned previously, the public health organisation acted as an information provider and did not respond to tweets. 
 Twitter chats may also be used as one component of a broader participatory process. A  Citizens’ Jury in South Australiautilised a Twitter chat during one day of the jury deliberations. This can enable a much wider audience to share their concerns or ideas on an issue for the jury to consider in their deliberations. 
 The loose nature of a Twitter chat means that it may be more fruitful for generating ideas and brainstorming, rather than focused or in-depth discussion  [2] . However, in an empirical analysis of Twitter chats on the Ebola and Zika outbreaks, the authors noted that tweets demonstrating expertise or extending the topic of the chat were excluded from interaction by the public health organisation running the event (Young et al). This suggests that the norms governing Twitter chats vary depending on the organisation or individual managing them; the Ebola/Zika example favoured a more question and answer based approach to the chat, rather than idea generation. 
 Analysis of Twitter chats can also illuminate the different ways in which broader publics and organisations understand issues. Another study pertaining to the Ebola and Zika outbreaks noted that public concerns about the diseases focused on the risk to women and babies, whilst the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who hosted the chats focused more on clinical features and education  [3] . This could suggest a need for better management of Twitter chats to respond more effectively to public concerns. 
 Given that many studies focus on public health and twitter chats, future research on Twitter chats would do well to analyse the extent to which they increase levels of public awareness or understanding of diseases, rather than describing the type of engagement that occurs. It is also worth noting that Twitter follows a specific definition of ‘engagement’, as how many times users interact with a tweet  [4] . This is clearly rather narrow and does not meet the requirements for meaningful public, community or civic engagement. However, this could further indicate the suitability for Twitter chats to be used  alongside other deliberative techniques and as part of broader participatory processes. 
 Twitter users are not representative of the general public, with most users being under the age of 30 and predominantly male. Moreover, many Twitter users do not actively tweet but follow others, and only spend a small amount of time on Twitter  [7] . In addition, Twitter chats are vulnerable to the same criticisms levelled at other self-selecting engagement processes: that those who participate are already actively engaged in the topic, the most articulate or the most dominant. Therefore, any general conclusions about public opinion drawn from Twitter chats should be made with caution and with these caveats in mind.

This method can in reality encompass a number of different formats; roundtables are a form of academic discussion, used as a technique for community and public engagement, and may also be used by organisations and businesses.  Roundtables are generally not open to the wider public, but involve a relatively small number of participants who discuss or deliberate on a topic that is usually identified beforehand. The key principle underpinning a roundtable is that all participants are on equal footing [1].  Roundtable discussions are distinct from the  Magic Roundtable , which is a specific deliberative technique. This entry refers to roundtables in a general sense, the implementation of which will vary in practice.  The general purpose of a roundtable is to hold a close discussion and exploration of a specific topic. A roundtable, holding all participants on equal footing, aims to confront issues rather than people [2]. The individual aim of a roundtable discussion will vary in practice. Roundtables are used as one-off events, as series, as a tool within broader participatory processes, and as established, ongoing meetings.  The  San Francisco Urban-Rural Roundtable  had a specific set of aims, where participants were given a list of four goals to focus on. The overall objective of this series of roundtables was to produce a final set of recommendations which were ultimately used as the basis for San Francisco’s first food policy.  The Coquitlam River Watershed Roundtable  in British Colombia was established as a permanent planning entity, having been chosen as a suitable structure through a participatory planning process. The latter application is distinct in its role being embedded as a part of an ongoing process, meeting on a biannual basis. Another ongoing use of roundtables is seen in the  Coffee Cup Revolution , an initiative to reduce waste. In this case, roundtables are used to discuss individual initiatives with stakeholders and the local community.  Origins and Development  Whilst the term was coined from King Arthur’s legendary round table where knights congregated, the roundtable as an engagement is somewhat more recent, arising in the 1980s “out of a need for consensus-building to identify problems and seek solutions in the relationship between formal decision makers (such as governments &amp; judiciaries) and other sectors of society (such as environmental groups, community groups &amp; other interest groups)” [2]. Nonetheless, the roundtable’s legendary origins are still relevant, since the round shape of the table meant that no one person sat at the head, and everyone seated was of equal stature [3].  How it Works  Generally participant numbers at a roundtable are relatively small, with 10-12 people [2]. However, larger numbers are manageable if participants are split up into smaller groups, as seen in the  Halton Citizens’ Reference Panel  which involved over 50 members of the public, split up into groups of seven or eight.  Participant demographics will vary according to the purpose and need of the organiser.Roundtables often involve stakeholders and stakeholder organisations who are invited by the organiser [4]. They are not usually open to the public (as observers), although members of the public may take part.  Participants are usually invited by the organiser a few weeks in advance of an event. Given the range of contexts in which roundtables are used, participants may comprise stakeholder or community organisations, business people, employees and employers, professional associations and others [2].  In some cases, participants may be recruited through promotion and advertising of the event [5]. This is more likely should the target participants be members of the public, or for an academic roundtable discussion.  A topic for a roundtable has usually been identified in advance. Selecting the topic and scope can be tricky as it must be clearly defined, yet allow the opportunity for open and natural discussion otherwise the conversation can dry up during the roundtable. Some guidelines suggest drawing up an agenda beforehand [2], splitting the topic into smaller areas for a more structured discussion [6], or focusing on specific goals as with the San Francisco Urban-Rural Roundtable.  Roundtables will generally make use of a facilitator or chair for the discussion, but this person should not lead or direct the discussion. The facilitator’s role is to try and ensure that everyone is included equally in the discussion and to keep the discussion on track, through reminding the group of the time or gently steering the conversation if it goes too far off track [6]. Again, this will depend on the scope and aims of each roundtable.  The time allotted for a roundtable discussion can also impact how exactly the discussion evolves. Given a limited time, participants may choose to work towards a specific goal or outcome, or instead spend the discussion on broader reflections without the impetus to achieve a specific output [5]. However, this will also depend on the scope of the topic and the aim of the organisers. It is essential that the facilitator is mindful of time to avoid participants’ frustration if the discussion is cut short—especially if it is a one-off meeting.  Consultancy firm Cocoate identify some specific rules and guidelines for a roundtable discussion, which includes no mobile phones or toilet breaks [2], which may be too restrictive or unsuitable for some purposes. General guidelines that could be more widely applicable may include:Listening to others—no interruptions when people are speaking  No other discussions whilst someone is talking  Everyone participating actively  No domination  Differences in opinion are not expressed or taken personally  Maintaining a civil tone and atmosphereNote that the above guidelines can also be established by the group themselves at the outset, by agreeing on some ground rules that the discussion will abide by [6].  As mentioned above, roundtables may or may not work towards a final decision, recommendation or output, depending on the purpose and scope. Roundtables were used as an additional component to the  Edmonton Citizens’ Jury , where citizens could simply share their opinions and feedback on the proposal of internet voting. Other uses might have a more structured remit, such as the San Francisco case cited above.  Roundtables are not usually open to the public or observers [2], but there are exceptions; the  Northumberland Hospital Collaborative Budget Strategy  was a participatory process where organisers hosted a Public Roundtable where an open invitation was extended to the public, and experts met with over fifty citizens.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The influence of a roundtable discussion will again vary according to its application. The  Coatquitlam River Watershed  Roundtable, although not formally empowered to make and enforce decisions, seeks to directly influence decision-makers through its recommendations. Notably, this roundtable format enjoys enhanced legitimacy given that it was carefully selected as a suitable structure as part of a broader participatory process, and is embedded into the structures governing the Coatquitlam River Watershed area.  The  San Francisco Urban-Rural Roundtable  also had considerable influence, with its recommendations positively endorsed by the Mayor who went on to turn them into policy. A further effect was the establishment of a similar event in Los Angeles.  However, it must be emphasised that as the aim and scope of roundtable discussions is varied, there is no general influence or outcome that is always sought, or achieved. Academic roundtable discussions may not aim towards a specific output, although it is not uncommon to aim for some kind of research publication to emerge from the discussion. Other roundtables such as those held as part of the  Edmonton Citizens’ Jury , were a forum for citizens to share their opinions and feedback which was incorporated into the Jury’s final recommendations.  As the application and purpose of roundtable discussions varies so widely, it is difficult to draw any general conclusions. With this in mind, a few points can be made.  Roundtables have an advantage of standard hearings in that they usually follow a relatively strict process which can make for a more effective discussion. They are also relatively inexpensive to run [4].  One disadvantage is that the small number of participants and the fact that they are usually invited leaves a roundtable vulnerable to criticism from those not present: why should those outside the room accept the outcomes of a discussion they were unable to participate in? This critique can also be levelled at any number of random selection deliberative processes [7], but is more acute in the case of formats like roundtables and  focus groups  when participants are more likely to be invited by the organiser, or self-selecting. Roundtable discussions will also be more difficult when the topic is particularly contentious and/or an adversarial atmosphere arises, although good facilitation may help to mitigate this [4].

5311,method,Expert Advisory Panel,https://participedia.net/method/5311,Expert advisory panels are a group of appointed experts who typically provide technical advice and recommendations based on their expert knowledge on specific issues directly to policymakers.,0,2018-06-15,2020-02-16,134860,"""Lucy J Parry Participedia Team""",https://participedia.net/user/134860,417734,"""Jaskiran Gakhal Participedia Team""",https://participedia.net/user/417734,en,,facetoface,consult,limited,,moderate,very_high,,,,small,,,city/town, national,,ask, express,,idea, general,,,,make,,," Problems and Purpose  An expert advisory panel is a group of appointed experts selected to provide advice on a specific issue, particularly issues requiring technical knowledge and expertise such as scientific issues [1]. The members of the panel should be independent from government or decision-makers, and their advice is provided as a group rather than as individuals [1].  Panels are frequently appointed by governments and public agencies, as outlined by Health Canada.[1]However, they can also be utilised as one element of a participatory process, such as this  Western Australian public engagement process . Thus, the precise function and mandate of an expert advisory panel is likely to vary.  An expert advisory panel is distinct from a  panel discussion  or a  Q&amp;A with experts . The latter are often held as a method of information provision for lay citizens, either as part of the information phase of a deliberative process or as an open public forum. By contrast, an expert advisory panel usually provides advice directly to decision-makers.  In general terms, an expert advisory panel is usually established when a government, agency or public engagement process requires specific technical expertise to help them reach a decision or develop policy.  Governments and organizations face the challenge of having to limit the number of expert voices that are able to participate in a discussion, whilst trying to ensure as broad a range of expertise as possible are included [2]. Setting up an expert advisory panel may mitigate this to some extent by selecting a diverse range of experts to provide advice [2].  The precise purpose of an expert panel will vary slightly, but Health Canada suggests the following as possible reasons for establishing a panel:policy development and implementation  program development and implementation  professional or scientific matters where there is a need to supplement expertise  a matter for which there is a lack of conclusive data or scientific certainty  a matter for which input on a risks and benefits evaluation, including ways to mitigate or minimize risks, would be beneficial [1]Another reason for setting an up an expert panel is to assist a decision-making body in the interpretation and understanding of evidence [4].  An expert panel may also assist in the organisation of a participatory process by suggesting particular topics or witnesses to provide information to deliberating citizens, or in the  evaluation of different criteria and options .  Origins and DevelopmentKnow how this method was developed? Help uscomplete this section! Participant Recruitment and Selection  Members of an expert advisory panel are usually selected or appointed due to their expertise in a particular area, by a government, public agency or - in the case of a participatory process - organisers or conveners. Members should be independent from whoever convenes the panel, so an expert panel should not include any government officials or public servants if set up by a government.  Expert advisory panels do not generally involve lay citizens as members of the panel, as individuals are specifically chosen for their expertise, rather than to reach a cross-section or random sample of the population. There may be some exceptions to this; Health Canada notes that someone may be appointed to join an expert advisory panel due to ‘first-hand personal experience as, for example, a health professional, patient, consumer, or caregiver’ [1]. In this case, such individuals may not have professional or academic expertise but provide expertise through their personal experiences. A distinct method is a  citizens’ advisory board  or citizens’ advisory panels which have been employed in participatory processes, such as in the  Northumberland Hills Hospital Collaborative Budget Strategy  .  Appointment processes will vary according to the organization appointing the panel. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) primarily considers an individual’s suitability based on ‘technical ability and experience’, but also considers international diversity when appointing a panel to try and get a broad range of perspectives [2].  When appointed as part of a deliberative or participatory process, an expert panel might be selected by a steering group, which is often set up to oversee a process. This was the case for Western Australia’s  Review of Agricultural Lime Routes  . Here, a steering group comprised of stakeholders, community and government representatives selected members for an expert panel.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The precise process followed by an expert advisory panel will vary according to its purpose and mandate. Expert advisory panels may be established for different lengths of time, ranging from several years [2] to simply the length of a deliberative process in that context. One important aspect is for the panel to have a clear focus and mandate at the outset [1, 3].  How exactly an expert advisory panel communicates is also likely to vary and there does not appear to be a fixed approach. Panels may meet on a semi-regular basis either in person or virtually [1], or members may attend meetings pertinent to their mandate held by government or other organizations. Some panels may contain smaller specialist groups within the panel who meet separately [5]. Given that an advisory panel is a non-executive body, it may not be bound by particular protocols regarding process and procedure, and may be organized more informally than other types of committees and boards [6].  Expert panels may also produce reports or support reports produced by organizations or government [7]. On the other hand, they may provide advice directly to decision-makers, with no direct connection to the general public.  An expert advisory panel provides advice and recommendations only and does not hold any decision-making power.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Expert advisory panels are - obviously - advisory in capacity. The organizations that establish them are not obliged to act on their recommendations. In practice, the work of expert advisory panels can have a range of outcomes.  Salerno et al (2011) report on the positive outcomes of an advisory panel on adult mental health in New York State. In this case, multiple panels were established by a mental health authority primarily to review evidence and provide practical recommendations on a variety of issues. Key to this approach was the combination of experts and stakeholders on the panel, along with an effort to engage with families using the services. This approach was cited as ‘a productive and efficient means of insuring that planning efforts by the state mental health authority are well informed with respect to both the evidence base and the practical realities of offering acceptable high-fidelity, high-quality practices’ [3].  A negative outcome is discussed by Drew and Grant (2016) in their review of how independent agencies and experts relates to blame in public policy making. In one case, an independent review panel on local government in New South Wales provided a report with recommendations for reform, but did not provide any empirical evidence to support their claims. This was then criticised by other experts and opposition politicians, although the chair of the panel then claimed their recommendations had been misrepresented, in an apparent attempt to shift blame [8].  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The above example by Drew and Grant (2017) highlights the importance of an expert advisory panel having clear parameters from the outset, particularly regarding where accountability ultimately lies. It should be clear that the organization or government convening the panel is responsible for making final decisions, and is accountable for those decisions [1]. In the case above, it appears that the government went ahead with the recommendations offered by the panel, despite a lack of evidence. Given that the ‘expert’ nature of the panel had been greatly emphasised by government, the failure to provide supporting evidence could serve to undermine the value of expertise [8].  Drew and Grant (2017) also discuss another panel which sought to distance itself from what was perceived as poor decisions already made by government. This panel was also mandated with reviewing local governments in Australia, and were asked to evaluate local councils according to predetermined criteria. These criteria had been widely criticised, and in its reports and recommendations the panel emphasised that the criteria had been established by government, rather than the panel.The authors argue that this is another attempt to ensure any blame is deflected from the panel onto government [8].  Another potential risk for an expert advisory panel is a lack of independence or perceived lack of it [8]. This, and the cases discussed by Drew and Grant (2017), emphasise the importance of establishing a clear focus, mandate and structure for any advisory panel, as well as careful consideration of who should serve on the panel [4].

Participants are able to ask questions of officials, and officials have the opportunity to learn about the community’s concerns and feedback [1]. It is essentially a  question and answer session , and does not include in-depth discussion or  deliberation .  A Town Hall is loosely related to  New England Town Meetings  and  21st Century Town Meetings . In the latter formats, participants are able to take decisions directly by voting on local legislations or proposals and can be considered a form of governance. By contrast, a Town Hall forum does not necessarily incorporate decision-making on the part of participants. Instead, it is an opportunity for information provision, expressing opinions and collecting feedback. In practice, the terms are often used interchangeably, and the term ‘town hall meeting’ can be used to refer to a New England style meeting with deliberation and decision-making, as well as the variation described in this entry.  The Town Hall format has been used in different settings including Presidential debates, by Congresspersons in their districts, and as an internal communication method for organisations; they are frequently used by universities in the US for senior management to communicate in person with both faculty and students.  Town Halls may be held on a regular basis - as in Nigeria where a large Town Hall is held quarterly in  Abuja  - or they may be held to specifically respond to a new proposal or to discuss a pressing issue or concern [1].  In contrast to a New England or 21st Century Town Meeting, the primary purpose of a Town Hall is to provide information and give an opportunity for the audience to share their views, comparable to a  Public Hearing  or  Q&amp;A with experts and officials .  Origins and Development  Town Halls were established in the United States as far back as the 1600s in New England  [3] . Town Hall Meetings have also been used for centuries in parts of Central and South America, known as  Cabildos Abiertos . However, the  New England Town Meeting  and Cabildo Abierto, which still exist in their original form today, are generally limited to local and regional governmental matters, and importantly, local participants are able to actually deliberate and vote on proposed legislation. The New England format has been updated with the  21st Century Town Meetingwhich uses technology to enable voting. A Town Hall is descended from the New England format but has departed in form [2]. Participants have the opportunity to listen to and ask questions of public officials, but do not make decisions directly.  The Town Hall format has spread beyond local politics. It has been used as a format for Presidential debates, reimagined as participatory theatre, and used as a method of internal communication within businesses and other organisations. Town Halls have been held around the world in various settings.  Quarterly Town Halls were held in Abuja, Nigeria  where the Minister for the capital meets with up to 1,000 residents and meetings were broadcast live.  In the US, the format was first used for Presidential communication in 1977 by Jimmy Carter [4]. It gained renewed popularity in 1992 with George Bush, Bill Clinton, and Ross Perot participating. The Town Hall format marked a departure from more formal presidential debates, meaning that ‘candidates couldn’t easily stick to their talking points and instead had to react to questions culled from the crowd. It also created a way for the public to see how candidates performed in a more informal environment’ [3]. The more informal atmosphere favoured Clinton who was accustomed to Town Hall forums with constituents in Arkansas, and the incumbent Bush came off poorly, being criticised for appearing too formal [3]. The Town Hall format has been used since for Presidential campaigns, as well as traditional formal debates. More recently, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton also struggled with the format. The nature of the Town Hall means that candidates have to respond to unexpected questions from the audience, and can come across poorly to an audience if they fail to connect with individuals asking questions [5].  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Town Halls are typically open to the public [1], meaning that participants self-select to attend. The recruitment of an audience for a Presidential Town Hall may be different: in the 1992 forum with Bush, Clinton and Perot, the audience was selected by a polling organisation and was specifically made up of undecided voters [3]. This is not the case with the majority of Town Halls. For meetings held within organisations between employers and employees, different policies may apply for participation.  The speakers at a Town Hall are usually public officials or government representatives. However, they are also held by organisations such as universities so speakers may include employers or senior management figures.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Prior to the meeting, a clear objective and possibly an agenda is usually established by the organiser [1]. The precise format of a Town Hall will vary in practice: some will focus more on presentations or speeches by the speakers, followed by a question and answer session [6]. Others may be more informal with more opportunity for exchange between audience and speakers.  The main point of interaction is in the question and answers between audience and speakers. Some Town Halls are filmed and broadcast to a wider audience. This is most obviously the case with the US Presidential debates, but other Town Halls that have been broadcast include the  Abuja Town Hall Meetings  in Nigeria, and recent US Town Halls on healthcare being widely covered by media.  Town Halls require a moderator or chair to facilitate discussion and questions from the audience, and keep the meeting on time. In contrast to the New England format, decisions are generally not made by the audience or participants at a Town Hall. Instead, the main purpose is for speakers to share information and collect feedback from the community [1].  Some general guidelines regarding the organisation of a Town Hall include:Planning and preparation in advance to establish a focus and agenda, arrange a venue, invite speakers and promote the meeting to potential participants  Having a good moderator who is able to keep the discussion on track, ensure that no speaker or participant dominates the meeting and encourage participation  Considering a follow-up to the meeting, such as a report that can be circulated to attendees [1]. In Abuja, communication channels were set up to collect feedback and monitor any outcomes from the Town Halls.Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  The influence and outcome of a Town Hall will depend on the aim and follow-up of the organisers. Organisers should ideally make it clear what kind of outcome may arise from a Town Hall, if any. In Nigeria, the outcomes of meetings were documented as action points by decision-makers, and the meetings contributed towards a stronger culture of participation in the city.  The perceived performance of candidates in Presidential Town Hall debates has generated significant debate and commentary. Whilst Bill Clinton emerged as the clear ‘winner’ of the 1992 Town Hall with Bush and Perot, it is not clear what this lasting effect of this might be, if anything.  Town Halls held on healthcare in the United States have been sites of conflict and controversy. The  National Centre for Dialogue and Deliberation  (NCDD) suggested back in 2009 that a lack of trust between the public and government was contributing towards anger and disruption at Town Halls over proposed Democratic healthcare reforms [2]. In 2017, it was the proposed repeal of healthcare legislation that led to further anger at Town Hall Meetings.[7] In the same year, it was reported that there had been a decline in the number of Republic Congresspersons holding Town Halls, despite the fact that they are traditionally thought of as ‘very politically safe’ [8].  Analysis and Lessons Learned  NCDD have suggested that the Town Hall format does not work, because it does not offer the opportunity for citizens to have their voices heard [2]. This is partly compounded by a lack of trust between citizens and government, whereby not only do the public not trust government, but officials do not trust the capacity or ability of citizens to consider complex issues [2]. Town Halls are focused on the speaker [9] with little room for in-depth discussion or deliberation over policy issues. There is thus no opportunity for learning or development of views [9].  Because audience members for a Town Hall are usually self selected, it is possible that those who attend are already politically engaged, or those who have a particular stake or interest in the issue at hand. This leaves the door open for interest groups to effectively hijack a Town Hall and dominate meetings [2]. Lukensmeyer and Brigham (2002) argue that as a result, decision makers do not get a complete view of citizens’ concerns. Instead, they proposed the  21st Century Town Meeting  as an update to the New England format, retaining the original features of deliberation and decision-making on the part of participants.  However, Town Halls may on occasion provide an important opportunity for citizens to question officials. In February 2018, a Town Hall was held in Florida on gun control, following a school shooting at Parkland.[10] At the forum, government officials were pointedly questioned by young people, parents and the local community over the issue. In this case, the meeting afforded an opportunity for school students, those directly affected by the issue and whose voices are not usually the most prominent in political debates, to have a platform and direct connection to decision makers. At the time of writing, it is too early to draw any conclusions about the lasting impact of this meeting.

In addition to being useful within community settings, [1] it also offers organizational applications. [2]  In both settings, Wisdom Councils are suitable for developing and implementing creative solutions to sensitive topics. In a community setting, it can additionally strengthen community members’ engagement with and understanding of participatory democracy. [4]  Origins and Development  The Wisdom Council Process was originally developed by U.S. consultant Jim Rough. [4] [5] The method has been further developed in the State of Vorarlberg, in Austria, by their Office of Future-Related Issues (Büro für Zukunftsfragen). Their adapted model is called a  Bürgerrat , sometimes referred to in the feminine plural as BürgerInnenRäte. In English, this translates as Citizens' Councils or Civic Councils.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  The original Wisdom Council design was for twelve randomly selected citizens.  While the original design is based on simple random selection, in Vorarlberg and elsewhere in Europe, the random selection process is carried out in a way that ensures that the mix of participants reflects the mix of the larger population. There have also been Councils with as many as 30 people, conducted in two separate groups which are then brought together at a later stage in the process.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  In the two-day working phase, the participants identify topics of public interest in their environment and develop suggestions for improvement / solutions. They are supported by a moderator trained in  Dynamic Facilitation , an approach designed to support creativity by creating psychological safety through deep and attentive listening. [6]  The moderator supports participants in creatively developing collaborative solutions to seemingly unsolvable problems. The focus is on the group's self-organization dynamics. With the help of this empowerment approach and its focus on group energy, the process has been found in practice to produce good results with a favorable cost-benefit ratio.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  The Wisdom Council Process has been a significant influence in the creation of the  Bürgerrät  model in Vorarlberg, which has been spreading in Austria and Germany due to its powerful and cost-effective results.  The typical outcomes of Wisdom Councils include a high energy level among participants, a strong sense of ""we"", a desire to take greater responsibility for addressing collective challenges, a greater appreciation of the complexity involved in public issues, along with a paradoxical sense of possibility. [7]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The first Wisdom Council in the civic domain was in 2003 in  Rogue Valley, Oregon . It was sponsored by a small handful of local citizen volunteers. Until that time, the founder of this method had thought that the process would need to be sponsored by governments to be successful, but was impressed by the value obtained through a purely citizen-led effort that still included expert facilitation.  Another community application took place in Port Townsend in 2005, with the  members of a local food  co-op who were experiencing internal strife.  The most extensive application in North America has been in the city of Victoria, where the process has been used a total of six times.  The first three Councils  used the original Wisdom Council format of beginning with a more open-ended question about improving collective well-being, while the next three used a slightly modified format called the  Citizen Insight Council  where the randomly-selected group focuses on a specific topic.  Despite the first example of the Rogue Valley Wisdom Council which was a grassroots effort, and a later attempt at such in Asheville, North Carolina, the most successful applications of the Wisdom Council model to date have been the  Bürgerräte in Austria , which have all been sponsored by local governments.  Note: the Wisdom Council model has also been used successfully to catalyze  organizational learning within business organizations  such as Swisscom; and also within government departments. including the Department of Agriculture in Washington State. Yet as that is not the focus of this site, we will not delve into those applications further other than to simply mention them.  See AlsoDynamic Facilitation  is the ""operating system"" of the Wisdom Council Process, since it creates psychological safety for divergent perspectives and thus evokes a high level of creative collaboration from participants.  The  Vorarlberg Bürgerrät  model has grown out of the Wisdom Council Process, and is one of the most successful applications of it to date.  References  [1] Hellrigl, M. &amp; Lederer, M. (2014).

By itself, participation can (and is) often equated with mere consultation. However, according to Lund, ""participation becomes co-creation, whereby public institutions enable citizens to actively engage themselves in social policymaking and service provision, and it becomes as much about harnessing resources as about empowering the deprived."" To be considered 'real', project managers, citizens, and stakeholders are increasingly demanding ""self-organising civic engagement.""[1] This definition of co-creation is, however, an ideal and is not representative of all cases of participatory governance claiming to be such. Ideally, co-creation involves participants as designers  and  implementors (if not also the initiators).[2]  Processes using co-creation as their guiding standard go beyond 'mere participation' or 'participation for participation's sake'. As participatory forms of governance become more common — especially in urban design and resource management — involved parties have come to embrace the definition of participation as co-creation: a process which seeks to build capacity, encourage active participation in decision-making and implementation, and include (meaningfully) those individuals disadvantaged by physical- or social-barriers.[1]  Origins and Development  Participant Recruitment and Selection  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  According to Lund, public innovation literature uses co-creation to refer to those processes which include citizens in one or more of the following roles: co-designer, co-implementer, and/or co-initiator. Ideally, citizens would take on both the role of co-designer and co-implementer with an eye to building the capacity for taking on the role of co-initiator, ie. ""self-organising and take the initiative to address a perceived problem, [followed by] collaborat[ion] with public authorities.""[2] Processes of co-creation thus vary on two dimensions:  when citizens participate and how active they are (or are allowed to be).  For example, the Government of Canada defines co-creation as ""a form of open policy making where those implicated by the outcome are directly involved in its creation.""[3] From this description, one might assume citizens are only given the role of co-designers; however, at least in the 2017 development of the Plant and Animal Health Strategy, the process of co-creation appears to indicate 'co-delivery' (ie. co-implementation) is the natural next-step.

 The Deep Listening Circles process was designed by author, placemaker, and public engagement professional Jay Pitter.[1] Deep Learning Circles are ""intended to create the comfort required to explore housing and ideas of feeling at home in changing cities."" Stories and 'human-centred data' build trust and empathy, making them essential to the  co-creation  of more inclusive, resilient, and vibrant communities.[2] 
 Origins and Development 
 Having spent her career meeting with communities and individuals in precarious housing situations, Ms. Pitter recognized a need for a more people-centred approach to urban planning and development. The shaping of spaces and places needs to be designed for and by the people that live there; to both reflect and embody the personal histories of its residents.[3] Deep Learning Circles fills the need for a process of open, inclusive dialogue between residents and city planners about the lived experience of social vulnerability.How it Works

 Under the leadership of Hugo Chavez, Venezuela began a program of decentralization and popular participation in 2006. Annouced in January, Chavez's plan was put into place less than a month later with the passing of the Law of Communal Councils ( consejos comunales)  which effectively institutionalized the councils in the political system. The councils were seen as an effective way to provide citizens with a horizontal channel of communication with the state and to devolve power over community-level decision-making to participatory and democratically-elected neighbourhood assemblies. 
 Origins and Development 
 In January of 2006, Chavez asked the National Assembly to officially recognize the power of community organizations. Three months after his address, the Assembly passed The Special Law of the Communal Councils, Article 1 of which states: 
 ""The Communal Councils represent the means through which the organized masses can take over the direct administration of the policies and projects which are created to respond to the needs and aspirations of the communities in the construction of a fair and just society. The organization, operation and action of the Communal Councils are governed by the principles of co-responsibility, cooperation, solidarity, transparency, accountability, social responsibility, fairness, justice, social controllership and economic self-management."" (Special Law on Communal Councils 2006) 
 Participant Recruitment and Selection 
 According to Article 2 of The Special Law on Communal Councils, ""a Community is the social conglomerate of families and citizens who inhabit the same geographical area; those who share a common history and interests; those who know one another and who relate with themselves; those who use the same public utilities; and those who share necessities and similar potentials in economic, social, city-planning and other ways."" Any community meeting those requirements can form its own communal council. In using a 'sociological' definition of community, the law recognizes that such social units differ in composition - from 200-400 families in urban areas to less than 20 families for rural areas and 15 for indigenous ones.The top decision-making body of oversight, the Citizens' Assembly, is made up individuals selected through direct and secret ballot voting. To be eligible for election, one must 1) be a member of the community represented by the council, 2) be older than 15, 3) have ""moral solvency"", 4) have available time to dedicate to council work, 5) possess a ""spirit of unity"", 6) be capable and willing to work in a team, and 7) agree to abide by the commands of the community (Law on Communal Councils 2006). The Assembly has the power to appoint a Spokesperson from each neighbourhood and Working Committee - the number and issue-area of which are determined through Assembly meetings. Together, the Assembly, the neighbourhoods, and the Committees (the latter two of which are represented by their own Spokesperson), constitute the executive body of the communal council.How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making 
 Today participatory democracy in Venezuela serves as a new experiment in popular power.  Officially recognized as decision-making bodies, the councils excellerated the decentralization of state governance by granting decision-making power to numerous self-managed entities at the local level. The Councils serve as the agency for a previously discontented mass to audit, consult with and engage their government. Officially the role of Councils is to send project proposals directly to the Presidential Commission of Popular Power. Constant and strong participation is encouraged and funded. 
 The councils have a highly sophisticated and multifarious structure which influences and is influenced by local power dynamics, vulnerabilities, utilisation of funding, sustainability, practicality, tendency for co-optation and their overall contribution to participatory democracy in Venezuela. 
 Communal Councils possess three separate branches of at least five people: the executive branch (which coordinates), the financial branch (which oversees the finances and the communal bank or cooperative) and the social controller branch (which audits the other branches). The elected spokespersons of the council belong to one of these branches, in which they can create projects. Ultimate power, however, lies in the citizens' assembly of all community members which must approve projects and fund allocations (Martinez., C. et al (2010)Venezuela Speaks: Voices From The Grassroots. PMPress) 
 As of 2010 over 30,000 Communal Councils have been established according to official government reports. Billions of dollars in state funds have seen their way down from the national government to council banks which have been organising infrastructure and socio-economic projects. The Communal Councils represent the articulation of citizen participation, public management and effective transfer of power and authority to the grassroots. 
 Influence, Outcomes, and Effects 
 Communal councils is monumental have successfully transfered some of the decision-making power from bureaucrats, mayors, and council members directly to the people. On paper, the councils are a bold, eclectic and dynamic step towards participatory democracy by Venezuela. The government announced, in February of 2012, that over 43,000 communal councils had been created (August, 2013: 50). 
 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 While, on paper, the Councils appear to be a magnificent tool for political mobilisation, there are some discrepancies between the promise and reality. 
 First, as David Smilde notes, participatory democracy “rarely becomes widespread without state sponsorship.” As a result, the autonomy of the Councils and other grassroots organisations immediately come into question as membership and funding may be conditioned in accordance to their political allegiance or ideological orientation. Further, the Councils become very susceptible to co-optation by the state in times of crisis, rendering it as merely an instrument of state power. 
 The second issue is concerned with participation itself. In examining six Councils in Caracas, Salazar (2013) documented the difficulty in effectively mobilising members. Many individuals simply do not have the time, the resources or the capacity to be engaged participants, therefore material incentives have to be deployed to encourage active involvement. Salazar then asks a pertinent question: “if the main motivation of the people to participate is material, then the formation of the [Councils] is also material?” Consequently, this produces other inquiries concerning self-sustainability: if the government, regardless of its political leanings, is unwilling or does not have the capacity to commit resources, does this reduce the impact and/or formation of the Councils? Will they still organise without state-sponsorship? 
 Lastly, the Councils have been overwhelmed with administrative problems. Their link to the state has become bureaucratic, making it vulnerable to both inefficient management and corruption, hampering the dynamism of popular power.

Training of observers:  Citizen observers were trained on the Nigerian judicial system, observation methodology, court decorum, and etiquettes. They were assigned courts and three cases each to observe. Facilitators included magistrates, NBA members, and PWAN members. The training was an opportunity for observers to ask questions about what they were to be observing. Court observation:  This approach allowed for engagement and collaboration between the judiciary and the implementing organizations and relied on citizens’ active participation through daily visits to court rooms to gauge procedures and processes and to monitor cases. Court users’ survey : This process produced an evidence-based report on happenings in the court rooms from the view of litigants, witnesses, victims, and lawyers. It served to balance observer reports.

In most cases, CDAs are officially designated as ‘private voluntary’ or ‘non-governmental’ associations; however, these labels should be applied with some skepticism especially in non-democratic or under-developed countries. In these contexts, these associations are often dominated by members of the political elite or are otherwise controlled by government officials. Egypt is one such case where CDAs are officially recognized by the government but, as Denis Sullivan notes, “virtually all participants in and observers of PVO/NGO activity...recognize that these organizations are far from being independent of the government, and many, in fact, are creations of that government.”[1] Nevertheless, CDAs play an important role in the life of locals, especially in 'weak' states where official government structures or bodies are non-existent, unwilling, or unable to provide assistance or basic social services. CDAs also give a voice to the community as, depending on their internal structure, local residents are generally members or else engage with the organization on a closer or more regular basis than they do with elected representatives or public administrators.Origins and DevelopmentCommunity development associations – in the most general use of the term – have no set beginning since they can be formal or informal, large or small, publicly or privately funded, etc. There is no official record of the ‘first’ CDA and often few publicly-available records on existing groups since, more often than not, they are informal groups of residents dedicating their time to the betterment of their community through a variety of means.  CDAs are found in most democratic states as they are born out of the right to freely associate and to pursue one’s own goals as long as they do not infringe on the rights of others. Crucial is the fact that democratic states do not prohibit (although they may regulate) the private provision of certain services. According to Fola Adelisi, community development is defined by the United Nations as “a process where community members come together to take collective action and generate solutions to common problems.” The outcome of this process is not only prevalent but necessary in democracy since it often involves “a set of values and practices which play a special role in overcoming poverty and disadvantage, knitting society together at the grass roots and deepening democracy.”[2]  While the broad definition of CDAs means their history is as varied as their structure and purposes, there are certain countries who have established such groups under national law. For example, the history of community development associations in Egypt is tied to state politics. Since the 1960s, the Egyptian government has played an increased role in welfare provision through so-called ‘ wihda’.  CDAs were established in 1964 and were also included in a new Egyptian NGO Law (84, 2002). Since their establishment, many of the CDAs have merged with the  wihda  and, while much of the leadership carried over from one to the other, Robert Latowsky notes that some are genuinely citizen-led. Indeed, while their Board of Directors or General Assemblies may include many of those employed in the civil service, their overall nature is more ‘middle-class’ than ‘government controlled’ – a common characteristic of such groups especially in less developed countries.[3]  Participant Recruitment and SelectionKnow how participants are recruited for this method? Help uscomplete this section!How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-MakingInternal ProcessesIn general, community development associations are non-profit and voluntary. The structure of CDAs varies depending on numerous factors including the scope of their operations, the types of activities they engage in, and their source(s) of funding. There is generally no requirement that CDAs be accountable to those they provide for or service although some countries have strict laws and regulations around their activity.  In Egypt, CDAs are officially recognized public service providers and, according to the NGO law of 2002, “compris[e] natural or judicial persons or both of them with a total of at least ten persons in all cases, and oriented to a purpose other than material profit.”[4] As well, a statute must be drawn up which includes such items as “representative bodies of the association, terms of reference for each, method of re-electing, discharging and annuling or suspending membership as well as the quorum necessary for valid meetings and valid resolutions.”[5] The form these elements take is, however, not dictated by a higher authority, so each Egyptian CDA follows its own process of internal management. While Latowsky was quoted earlier on the grass-roots or citizen-led nature of many of these associations, the trust between citizens and members can sometimes be strained if the organization is not structured representatively or it is not transparent in its dealings. This is the subject of this case study on the  Shams El-Bir CDA in El-kfoor . Sullivan, writing in 1994, observed that most CDAs were administered by “public officials, retired government employees, and [Ministry of Social Affairs] MOSA representatives.”[6] While CDAs were also included in the 2002 NGO law, it is unlikely that their composition or structure has altered significantly and, at the very least, the middle-class appears to be overrepresented in their membership.[7]  Another example of group dynamics comes from Nigeria where CDAs provide many – and in some cases, all – public services. Since they are so heavily relied on, associations have in some cases begun coercing residents into service. As well, Adelisi notes that, similar to those in Egypt, Nigerian CDAs tend to be dominated by the middle and upper classes – in this case, landowners and their representatives.[8] In general, funding for these organizations come from membership dues and levies.External &amp; Community EngagementAgain, speaking in the most general of terms, CDAs are engaged in the betterment of their communities. What form this takes and how it comes about depends on the goals of its members and the association’s access to resources. Common methods, tools and techniques CDAs use to engage constituents and perform their work are:  community committees ,  peoples’ parleys ,  participatory rural appraisal ,  community organizing ,  asset-based community development ,  community auditing ,  community health care ,  Local-to-Local Dialogues ,  participatory arts , and  civic education . In Nigeria, CDAs are often the only organization capable of providing services on the community level. For example, Adelisi lists security, electricity, road construction and urbanization as just some of the activities he has observed CDAs undertaking.[9] The New Horizon Association for Social Development working in Egypt similarly notes that CDAs – especially those in poor or marginalized communities – “play a major role in supporting and representing community members’ interests and problems regarding basic concerns such as access to health, education, housing, work.”[10]  Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsKnow what outcomes and effects this method typically has? Help uscomplete this section!Analysis and Lessons Learned  The democratic accountability of these association is, however, often left wanting. One CDA, the  El-Shams El-Bir Association in El-kfoor , worked with NGO San Mark Development to increase their responsiveness to resident needs through a process of participatory rural appraisal and the establishment of a  community committee . Sullivan notes that, while CDAs retained the  wihda’s  goals of rural development and urbanization, their establishment in 1964 meant that their work was “no longer seen as top-down, urban-to-rural, centre-to-periphery responsibility...but as a self-generated development process.”[11]See AlsoEl-Shams El Bir CDA  (case)Community Committees  (method)  References  [1] Dennis Joseph Sullivan,  Private Voluntary Organizations in Egypt: Islamic Development, Private Initiative, and State Control  (Gainsville, FL: University Press of Florida, 1994), 15.

It derives its name from the indigenous system of governance in villages and among castes and communities by a group or council of elders called Panchayat, who have been prevalent in Northern parts of South Asia for centuries. In contemporary India, Panchayats, along with municipal corporations in urban areas, are the third level of governance, distinct from the central (federal) and state (provincial) governments.  Although modern village Panchayats have been constituted since the late 1950s in several states in India, they were not given enough power and responsibilities and were neglected. The 73rd constitutional amendment of 1992 laid out provisions for the creation of local self-government institutions in villages consisting of an elected body called Panchayat which will be accountable to the Gram Sabha - the assembly of all eligible voters in a village. The amendment mandated states to conduct regular elections to Panchayats and also laid out the broad function of Panchayat Raj - the preparation and implementation of plans for economic development and social justice. It also made provisions to ensure adequate and sustained financial resources for these institutions to operate autonomously. According to the Ministry of Panchayat Raj, Government of India, there are 247,166 Gram Panchayats in India. [1]  Since the devolution of legislative and administrative power was only 'recommended', many PRIs do not actually hold as much power as their constitutional description implies. [2] However, the Indian Government remains committed to a programme of legislative decentralisation so PRIs continue to exist while their powers remain in a state of negotiation.  Origins and Development  The idea of Panchayati Raj derives from the indigenous system of local governance and governance of communities or caste groups through councils of elders in India.Henry Maine’s  Village Communities in the East and West  brought scholarly attention to this institution in the late nineteenth century.  During the colonial period, Indian thinkers and leaders used the idea of India having self-governing institutions in the form of Panchayats to contest British claims of Indians as unfit for self-government and freedom.M.K. Gandhi, the most prominent leader of the anti-colonial struggle in India, not only used the idea of Panchayats to make claims for a free India, but also made it an essential component of his vision for an independent India. Gandhi says, ""Independence must begin at the bottom.Thus, every village will be a republic or  panchayat  having full powers.It follows, therefore, that every village has to be self-sustained and capable of managing its affairs even to the extent of defending itself against the whole world. […] In this structure composed of innumerable villages, there will be ever-widening, never-ascending circles.Life will not be a pyramid with the apex sustained by the bottom."" [3]  However, the constitution of independent India did not adopt Gandhi's vision for its governance. The majority in the Constituent Assembly of India favoured a federal but centralized polity. The Draft Constitution presented to the Constituent Assembly of India made no mention of Panchayats.Gandhians in the Constituent Assembly contested this omission.As a concession to the advocates of the Panchayat system an Article on “Organisation of Village Panchayats” was included in the section on Directive Principles of State Policy (a set of guidelines and aspirational socio-economic agendas that should inform the state in making laws and policies) in the Indian Constitution (adopted in 1950), which stated that “[t]he State shall take steps to organize village panchayats and endow them with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as units of self-government.” [4]No immediate efforts were taken by the government for the establishment of village Panchayats.  In 1950, the Government of India established the Planning Commission to formulate its five-year plans for economic development.The first five-year plan (1951-56) contained a scheme for rural development called the Community Development Programme.The government started implementing this programme in 1952 and another scheme called the National Extension Service supplemented it in 1953. [5]In 1957, the government appointed the Balwant Rai Mehta Committee to assess these initiatives and recommend measures to improve them.This Committee identified that community participation or public involvement is crucial for the success of community development schemes.It recommended the setting up of a three-tier Panchayat system – Gram Panchayat at the village level, Panchayat Samiti at the block level, and Zila Parishad at the district level – for greater participation of people in government’s rural development schemes.Almost all state (provincial) governments passed legislations for organizing Panchayats in the states.These were the  first-generation Panchayat Raj institutions .They were largely non-political in nature and their purpose was better implementation of central government directed Community Development Programme. George Mathew reports that by 1959 all states passed their Panchayat Acts and by mid-1960s Panchayats were established all over the country. “More than 217,300 village panchayats, covering over 96 percent of the 579,000 inhabited villages and the 92 percent of the rural population had been established.” [6]  The  second generation of Panchayat Raj institutions  with a focus on local level planning emerged with the constitution of the Ashok Mehta Committee in 1977 by the first non-Congress Party government at the Centre.The committee was asked to provide recommendations to strengthen the Panchayat system and for greater participation of the weaker sections of the villages in the Panchayat.The Mehta Committee pointed out the importance of  Gram Sabhas  for decentralized democracy.The Committee noted that due to public apathy and the lack of interest on the part of officials, Gram Sabhas are not operating satisfactorily, whereas the “gram sabha has an important role in activating the democratic process at the grass roots level, in inculcating community spirit, in increasing political awareness and enabling the weaker sections to progressively assert their point of view.” [7] The states of West Bengal, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir either made changes in their Panchayat Acts or passed new Acts to implement the recommendations of the Mehta Committee.  Later, two further committees were constituted to study the workings of the Panchayat system – the G.V.K. Rao Committee (1985) and the L.M. Singhvi Committee (1986) – they identified the lack of constitutional safeguard as an impediment for the proper functioning of Panchayats.Singhvi Committee recommended that “Local self-government and more particularly, Panchayati Raj institutions, should be constitutionally proclaimed as the third tier of Government” and “that a separate chapter should be added in the Constitution so as to make the identity and integrity of the Panchayati Raj institutions reasonably and substantially inviolate.” [8]  In view of the Singhvi Committee’s recommendation the central government led by Rajiv Gandhi introduced the Sixty-Fourth Constitution Amendment Bill in 1989, which proposed to add a separate chapter in the Indian constitution for Panchayats to be constitutionally recognized self-government institutions at the rural level. [9]The Bill was passed in the form of Seventy-Third Constitution Amendment Act of 1992 and came into effect in April 1993.This was the beginning of the  third generation of Panchayat Raj institutions.Participant Recruitment and Selection  All persons registered as voters in a village area designated as panchayat area constitute the Gram Sabha (village assembly). The panchayat area is divided into several territorial constituencies (usually called wards) and voters in each ward elect their member to the village Panchayat every five years. Seats in the village panchayat is reserved for candiadates belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population in the village. These reserved seats alloted to different wards on a rotational basis. Seats are also reserved, again in a rotational manner, to women candiadates. The intial constitutional amendment mandated up to one-third seats to be reserved for women. Currently, 20 states in India have reserved 50 per cent seats to women in Panchayats. [10]  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The main deliberative bodies of the panchayat system are the gram sabhas. Made up of all residents living in a gram pachayat area (approx. 10,000), the gram sabhas meet every year in December. During this meeting, elected representatives review the state of the budget - the implementation of last year's and the plans for the coming year's.[11]  Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsKnow what outcomes and effects this method typically has? Help uscomplete this section!Analysis and Lessons Learned  According to Fung and Wright, three constitutional changes were significant for the development of an empowered, democratic pachayati raj system: ""First, these reforms increased the financing capacity of the lowest-level panchayat authorities – the gram panchayats – by imposing a revenuesharing scheme with the districts and gave the gram panchayats their own taxing power. Second, these measures stipulated that one-third of the seats in panchayat assemblies and leadership positions would be occupied by women and that lower-caste – Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (SC/ST) – persons would occupy leadership positions in all of these bodies in proportion to their population in the district. Finally, and most importantly for our purposes, the 1993 reforms established two kinds of directly deliberative body, called gram sabhas, to increase the popular accountability of gram panchayat representatives.""

The Schools to offer inclusive spaces for community dialogue, capacity building, and action.",0,2018-07-21,2018-07-21,110904,"""Scott Fletcher Bowlsby""",https://participedia.net/user/110904,110904,"""Scott Fletcher Bowlsby""",https://participedia.net/user/110904,en,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,local,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Problems and Purpose 
 Schools of Participation aim to address poverty, inequality and social exclusion through empowering disadvantaged communities and individuals over a period of weeks or months. Each School offers an inclusive space for people to meet, share their experiences and most importantly, gain the skills needed to mobilise in the community and take action for effective change. The approach is influenced by the work of Paulo Freire on popular education. 
 Origins and Development 
 Schools of Participation were originally developed by the UK-based charity Church Action on Poverty. The charity has gone on to train people and organizations in the use of the method. Manchester’s Community Pride Unit is one of the most well known examples of a Church Action on Poverty affiliate who has implemented Schools of Participation in Greater Manchester. The group uses the Schools method to address poverty in Greater Manchester by tackling power inequality between those who live in the city and those who are in charge of it [1]. 
 Participant Recruitment and Selection 
 Each school typically involves between 8-15 participants. Participants share a mutual disadvantage in their lives and past schools have included refugees and people seeking asylum, homeless men, people with sensory disabilities, Asian women and people with learning disabilities [2]. It is not clear exactly how participants are recruited individually but it seems to be the case that the schools are set up with the help of community organisations who presumably have a relationship with the specific groups involved. 
 How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making 
 Schools of Participation utilise a range of deliberative tools and techniques including: group discussion 
 participatory exercises on power 
 building listening and communication skills 
 forum theatre Schools of Participation require a trained facilitator, although sessions should be led by participants. The process follows a participatory action and learning approach, which aims for a community to identify their needs and develop realistic plans of action. Schools can last from a matter of days spread over a month to, for example, every weekend for a year. Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsThe immediate outcome for participants is the opportunity to build confidence and skills in listening and negotiating. The aim is that participants are more likely to get actively involved in their community through campaigns or other actions. It is hoped that people will also take these skills and enthusiasm back into the community. In the past, participants from Schools have gone on to work with the police and housing organisations, to work on issues that were raised and discussed during the School [2].

Communication over SMS allows for the sending and receiving of simple and complex messages including, for example, survey responses, long-form issue reports, question and answers, proposal submissions, and voting. SMS is often used in conjunction with other feedback or communication methods as a way to increase participation to those who cannot be physically present. SMS also decreases the costs associated with organizing and running a participatory initiative as it reduces the need for physical spaces of assembly.  Origins and Development  How it Works  Voting by SMS has been used in Mongolia in the following way. First, the government distributed information about an upcoming referendum via SMS to citizens' phones. At a later date, the government distributed a form listing the referendum voting choices, via SMS to citizens' phones. When citizens made their vote using the form, the voting choices were transmitted by SMS to the government agency that administered the election.[1]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  See AlsoOnline VotingReferences  [1] Hahn, A.

You can help Participedia by adding to it.Problems and PurposeThe Finnish Citizens’ Initiative is an instrument of direct democracy. In the field of political science, the concept of direct democracy means those instruments that are included in the legislation, such as the popular vote and the citizens’ initiative (Christensen et al. 2016, 12). Introduced only recently as a new institution to the system that is based on representative democracy, it is justified to categorize the Finnish Citizens’ Initiative as a democratic innovation. Although it is a so-called agenda initiative, meaning that it does not lead to a popular vote, it does influence the political agenda-setting and therefore is expected to increase political inclusion. (Christensen et al. 2017, 1, 3, 452.) Origins and DevelopmentThe Citizens' Initiative was included in a constitutional amendment bill that was handed over to the Parliament in 2010. After two legislatures had passed the amendments the revised constitution was enacted in 2012, together with a separate law to regulate the initiative institution more specifically. The Constitution specifies how many endorsements are needed before the CI can be delivered for the Parliament’s consideration. It also determines that the initiative should affiliate with legislation, meaning that it is possible to propose new legislation, amendments to or repealing of the existing legislation. In other words, the international agreements and obligations, as well as budgetary decisions are out of the scope of the citizens’ initiative (Finlex). Other requirements concerning the citizens’ initiative are stated in a separate law. Most importantly, there is a six-month time limit to gather the support for a specific initiative. Also, the technical details concerning the format of the initiative are regulated: the initiative needs to contain a bill or a proposal for the Parliament to begin preparations to change the legislation, together with the justification of the requested changes. The title needs to be informative of the content, and there needs to be the same date in the initiative and in all the support declarations. An initiative should only concern single topic. Finland has two official languages, Finnish and Swedish, and the citizens’ initiative can be written in either, or both (Finlex). Participant Recruitment and SelectionHow it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-MakingOnline platforms The law on citizens' initiative defines the procedures and technical requirements for online collection of signatures. It also specifically mentions the possibility of collecting signatures on an online platform, provided by the Ministry of Justice. However, other organizations are also allowed to develop independent platforms. (Christensen et al. 2015, 25-45.) A vast majority of expressions of support are collected on the governmental website  www.kansalaisaloite.fi , which provides a platform for launching CI’s and collecting statements of support for the initiatives. (Christensen et al. 2017, 10.)The online service is free of charge, accessible and is available in Finnish and Swedish. It also allows users to collect statements for initiatives that have already been started in other online services or on paper. The Ministry of Justice checks that the initiatives submitted by citizens contain the required information and that they do not contain material unsuitable for publication, but otherwise remains neutral in the process. (Oikeusministeriö / Ministry of Justice.)While  www.kansalaisaloite.fi  only allows the collection of statements of support, there is also an alternative platform,  www.avoinministerio.fi , which is created to offer counseling and gathering voluntary expertise that can help in drafting the initiatives in proper form, and to further develop the ideas. Www.avoinministerio.fi is operated under a non-profit organization, Open ministry or Avoin Ministeriö, and it doesn’t have opinions or political preferences as an institution (Open ministry). In comparison to  www.kansalaisaloite.fi , it is more geared towards offering assistance to individuals and organizations that wish to develop their idea before submitting it for collection of statements of support. More on the Open Ministry in Participedia site here:  https://www.participedia.net/en/organizations/open-ministry-avoin-ministeri . 
 Out of all the statements of support collected, a vast majority is collected on  www.kansalaisaloite.fi . This is because compared to campaigning through traditional means in public spaces, collection of expressions of support online is much easier. The accessibility of the use of CI is improved by online signature collection. It has enabled smaller civic groups to reach the signature thresholds for their causes, by the making it less time and resource consuming to commit to campaign for an initiative. (Christensen et al. 2017, 9.) Parliamentary processions Following the completion of the collection of statements of support, the organiser shall submit the statements to the Population Register Centre, which checks the validity of the statements of support and verifies the number of valid statements. If the number of the valid statements reaches the required threshold of 50.000, the organiser may submit their initiative for the Finnish Parliament to consider. The initiative must be submitted to the Parliament within six months or it lapses. (Oikeusministeriö / Ministry of Justice.) The Parliament is obliged to deal with an initiative. However, it is left to the Parliament’s discretion to decide whether they want to approve, amend or reject the initiative. 
 The procedures concerning the processing the CI’s are not included in the legislation, but in the Parliamentary rules of procedure. (Christensen et al. 2017, 9.) While the Parliamentary procedures stipulate that the CI’s should be handled like any other law proposals, it does not stipulate whether they should be given a priority compared to legislative initiatives by individual MP’s. Often, legislative proposals by the government are given priority, while the legislative proposals by individual MP’s tend to be pending in the committees for such a long time that they never reach the committee agenda before the Parliament’s term ends, at which point the proposal expires. (Christensen et al. 2017, 9.)The justifications of the constitution state that the CI should be held comparable with a law proposal by 100 MP’s (out of total 200 MP’s), instead of being held comparable to those made by individual MP’s. Further, the civic society persisted with their demand for acceptable procedures. Especially Open Ministry had a major role in keeping the issue of the procedures topical, until it became somewhat of a customary policy. Yet, the idea of giving privilege to the processions of citizens' initiative has received some criticism from individual MP’s and the secretary-in-chief of the Parliament (Helsingin Sanomat 12.3.2013).T 
 he citizens’ initiative’s consideration in the Parliament begins with a preliminary debate in plenary session. According to the recommendations by the Speaker’s Council, the debates and the committee hearings should be open to individual MP’s, ministers and the media. The initiators of the initiative also have the right to be heard in a relevant committee and state their case. The committees may also hear representatives from relevant ministries and other experts (The Finnish Parliament.) Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsDespite the uncertainty of the noteworthiness of the CI compared to other initiatives, there have been no problems in processing the initiatives in the Finnish Parliament. None of the initiatives have been ‘buried’ in committees, but have received swift and thorough processing. A committee relevant to the issue has given a report on the initiatives, after which the reports have been discussed and voted on at the plenary. The initiators have also been given the right to be heard in the committees and the committee hearings have been open to all MP’s and the media. The open and public committee work has also improved the public image of the committees and the CI and has helped promote openness in legislative decision-making. (Christensen et al. 2017, 10.)Until March 2017, there have been 600 proposals for initiatives, out of which 543 have expired at the end of the six-months' time limit, without being succesful in collecting the required 50.000 support declarations. For 41 proposals, the signature collection is still ongoing. 16 proposals have reached the status of citizens’ initiative, with the required amount of endorsements, and been delivered to the Parliament’s consideration. Only one (Equal marriage law) has been passed as new legislation, with only minor changes. Analysis and Lessons LearnedOver the last decades, there has been a discussion of a change in the ways people participate in politics (see eg. Rosanvallon 2006). Traditional political participation (voting, participating in the party politics) has decreased. Concurrently, the popularity of the new modes of political participation has increased. People, especially young people, participate based on single-issue interests. Simultaneously, the gap between people who are politically active and those who are not keeps widening. (Christensen et al. 2017, 1, 5.)Political participation is linked to personal resources, motivation and networks. Perception of political participation as rational action, sense of duty and accessibility of instruments further increase the probability of participation. Voting in national elections is one of the most common acts of traditional political participation. The study concerning the voting in Finnish parliamentary elections in 2015 states that the pattern regarding the connection between age and voting persists to exist. Young people are less likely to vote than middle-aged, and the voting percentage decreases slightly towards older age. Educational levels of an individual and their parents, occupational and economical statuses, as well as the operational model learned at home are strongly connected to the likelihood of voting. The differences in the levels of political participation of different groups can lead to biases in political representation. More equal society and emphasis on education and accessibility of instruments of participation are likely to level the differences in political participation between different groups thus enhancing the political process. (Grönlund &amp; Wass 2016, 177-194.)Democratic innovations are targeted to increase the political inclusion. The Finnish Citizens’ Initiative allows citizens to participate in setting the political agenda. It is also expected to mobilize marginalized or politically passive groups. (Christensen et al. 2017, 3.) According to research by Christensen, Jäske, Setälä &amp; Laitinen (2017, 20) the Finnish Citizens’ Initiative has reached the goal of helping to increase the democratic inclusiveness. They also notify that the inequalities in political participation can be seen to have a link to socio-demographic resources and civic skills. Inequality in political participation that leads to bias in representative democracy can further increase the exclusion and inactiveness. (ibid. 5, 18.)The potential risk that the Citizens’ Initiative becomes an instrument mostly used by the already active groups rather than those marginalized ones has been acknowledged. However, it seems that CI has managed to activate also some of the marginalized groups: especially young people have been more active in using the CI than other forms of political participation. Also women have been more likely to sign an initiative than men. Nonetheless, the CI has not managed to mobilize the people with low political interest, whereas people with links to political parties are more likely to initiate and support initiatives. Internet usage has a strong influence and predicts being active regarding initiatives. (Christensen et al. 2017, 16-19.) Overall it is more likely that the young, more educated people living in cities will initiate or sign an initiative. Same applies to people who identify themselves being politically left rather than right. On the other hand, also unemployment and poor health seem to activate people regarding the CI, whereas usually these factors decrease traditional political participation. (Christensen et al. 2016, 26.)According to Ministry of Justice 74% of the population acknowledges the Citizens’ Initiative as a positive amendment to democracy (According to Open Ministry the percentage of people of this opinion is 83%). Approximately one third (35%) of the whole population claims to have signed at least one initiative. (Christensen et al. 2016, 43, 444.) To compare, 70,1% of the population used their vote in the last parliamentary elections in 2015 (Grönlund 2016, 66). 
 Public perception of the CI seems positive, keeping in mind that it has been in use only since 2012. In addition, it has mobilized some of the marginalized groups. Hence it could be interpreted increasing the inclusiveness of the Finnish political system. However, it cannot erase all inequalities in political participation, and even new inequalities may occur. For example, those less familiar with internet could be marginalized. (Christensen et al. 2017, 12, 20.)The indirect impact has been more substantial than what it may seem by looking at both, the ratio of proposals for initiatives to the actual CI’s, and the passed legislation. Initiatives have brought issues to the public discussion, partly due to the media attention. Also in few cases the Parliament has decided to take further actions concerning the issues presented in the initiatives. Therefore, it looks like the Citizens’ Initiative has been somewhat successful in affecting the political agenda. The accessibility of the Citizens’ Initiative is increased by the possibility of collecting the signatures on the online platforms. According to research, the fact that most signatures are collected online shows that also those initiatives that are backed with fewer resources can be successful. (Christensen et al. 2016, 14, 41, 63.) 
 The future success and support of the Citizens’ Initiative depends on the parliamentary handling of them. So far it appears the Parliament has respected the CI’s and has properly processed all the initiatives to have reached the required support of 50.000 citizens. CI seems like a successful supplement to representative democracy, since it does not reduce the use of more traditional modes of political participation. On the contrary, it has been seen as potential instrument of increasing the political participation by activating young people who will continue to also participate later on in life.

Introduced by the then-ruling Communist Party of India — Marxist, the state-wide  People's Campaign for Decentralized Planning  continued a tradition of political devolution and local empowerment begun by Kerala's first democratically elected government in 1957.  Origins and Development  Beginning in 1996, ""a coalition of left parties led by the Communist Party of India—Marxist (CPI(M)) returned to power and immediately fulfilled one of its most important campaign pledges by launching the “People’s Campaign for Decentralized Planning.” All 1,214 local governments in Kerala—municipalities and the three rural tiers of district, block, and grama panchayats—were given new functions and powers of decision making, and were granted discretionary budgeting authority over 35–40% of the state’s developmental expenditures. State officials sought to directly promote participatory democracy by mandating structures and processes designed to maximize the direct involvement of citizens in planning and budgeting. In both its scope and design, the campaign represents the most ambitious and concerted state-led effort to build local institutions of participatory democratic governance ever undertaken in the subcontinent.[1]  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Participation during the first phase (idea generation) is open to all, and participants are self-selected, but the meetings are held on holidays so that everyone can attend. Planning documents are distributed, and the event is well publicized. Those who go on to the next level of the process are selected by their forum groups, and join local political leaders, key officials in the area, and experts.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Public participation in planning follows a four-step, yearly process involving meetings and  deliberations  at multiple levels of government. Small group deliberation,  Gram Sabhas  (open town meetings), facilitated brainstorming sessions, development seminars, project implementation, and budget allocation are just some of the methods and tools used to involve the wider public in the planning of community developments. The basic nested structure of participation in the annual planning and budgeting cycle consists of four discrete stages.Phase 1: Idea Formation and Agenda Setting at Public MeetingsThe first phase of the people's participation is to identify the needs of the people and gaps in local development through meetings (Brainstorming). Special care is taken to ensure adequate attendance not only of people, but of viewpoints to assure proper articulation of the various views in the community.Gram Sabhas are held at the ward level (there are 10–12 wards in a panchayat) and act as an open forum in which residents identify local development problems, generate priorities, and form sub-sector Development Seminars in which specific proposals first take shape. Subsequent Gram Sabhas select beneficiaries for targeted schemes. The Gram Sabhas are open meetings, presided by local elected officials, and facilitated by the Key Resource Persons (KRPs). They are always held on holidays, and in public buildings (usually schools). Preparations for the assemblies include extensive publicity, and the distribution of various planning documents. Minutes are kept, and each sub-sector group presents a report of its deliberations and produces a list of “felt needs.""Phase 2: Drafting Solutions at Development SeminarsOnce the issues have been identified during the first phase, 200-300 participants attend 1 day development seminars to work out integrated solutions to those problems that were identified. They break up into 12-13 task forces to tackle the various issues.Development Seminars develop integrated solutions for various problems identified at Gram Sabhas. The Seminars are constituted of representatives selected by the Gram Sabhas, members of panchayat samithi, local political leaders, key officials of the area, and experts from the locality and outside. The seminars were required to produce a comprehensive planning document for the panchayat.Phase 3: Turning Solutions into Concrete Project ProposalsFollowing the seminars, the task forces create development reports containing local history, resources, problem analysis, and development potential.Task Forces are selected by the Development Seminars and are charged with converting the broad solutions of the seminars into project/scheme proposals to be integrated into the final panchayat plan. In general, a Task Force is constituted for each of 10 development sectors, including women’s development, and includes a member of the panchayat samithi, the relevant local official and representatives selected by the Gram Sabhas.Phase 4: Budget Formulation and Project FinalizationThe fourth phase of the annual planning exercise is the actual formulation of the panchayat or municipal budget. The task forces takes the integrated solutions and combine them into project and scheme proposals that can be used by the larger government.Drawing on the shelf of sectoral projects designed by the Task Forces, the panchayat drafts local plan based on available budgetary resources, which include grant-in-aid (the largest component), own resources (local taxes and local resource mobilization) and state or center-project funds.[1]  Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsKnow what outcomes and effects this method typically has?

 The  gram sabha  was instituted in 1992 as a part of the 73rd amendment to the Indian constitution, which requires that 840 million people living in approximately one million villages in rural India have the opportunity to participate in deliberation about political issues. Research indicates that democratic deliberation is possible in these contexts, particularly where efforts are made to provide resources to citizens that might mitigate inequalities. Perhaps the most notable example of the use of  gram sabhas  is found in the  Kerala People’s Campaign for Decentralized Planning . 
 Origins and Development 
 India’s use of deliberative institutions dates back to at least 5BC (Sen, 2006). These institutions – such as  sabhas ,  kathas ,  panchayats , and  samajs –  allowed both peasants and various intellectual, political, and religious elites an opportunity to engage in public debate and question the state. Indeed, “the term  sabha  (association) itself originally indicated a meeting in which different qualities of people and opinions were tested, rather than the scene of a pronunciamento by caste elders” (Bayly, 2006, p. 187). 
 The modern use of deliberative institutions can be traced back to Henry Maine, who was inspired by British accounts of indigenous systems of autonomous village governments to develop a theory of decentralized government based around villages, rather than a centralized state (Maine, 1880). Maine’s account suggested that laws might be developed from the ground-up in a way that was consistent with traditional customs. In 1882, British Viceroy Lord Ripon took up some of Maine’s suggestions, reforming local government to provide “political education” and revive India’s indigenous methods of governance (Tinker, 1968). A 1920 Act established democratically elected village councils, although these institutions varied considerably from province to province (Tinker, 1968). 
 Maine’s understanding of Indian village governance also shaped Mohandas Gandhi’s thinking. Gandhi saw self-reliant villages and decentralized power as the ideals to which an independent India should aspire to realize (Mantena, 2010; Rudolph, Rudolph, &amp; Rudolph, 2006). He suggested that a loose federation of villages – the  panchayat raj  – would produce a system of democracy centred around local participation and cooperation. On the other hand, B.R. Ambedkar, an advocate for the rights of Dalits (formerly untouchables) and the primary architect of the Constitution, asked “What is the village but a sink of localism, a den of ignorance, narrow -mindedness and communalism?” (Immerwahr, 2015, p. 86). Ultimately, Gandhi’s proposal failed to gain sufficient political support during the Constituent Assembly Debates due to concerns that illiteracy, inequality, and hierarchical social structures in rural India would prevent limit the effectiveness of citizen participation. 
 Village democracy did not entirely disappear from the Indian constitution, however; Article 40 stated that “the State shall take steps to organize village  panchayats  and endow them with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as units of self-government.” This article was non-binding, but some state governments did establish formal village democracies. India’s largest stage, Uttar Pradesh, eventually developed a novel form of deliberative institution – the  gaon sabha  – which was convened twice a year to debate and set priorities for the village (Retzlaff, 1962; Tinker, 1968). 
 The growth of international interest in participatory development coincided with the release of a 1957 report that proposed decentralizing democracy into three tiers of local government. This proposal, known as  Panchayati Raj , was intended to empower local development efforts (Mehta, 1957). Yet, the  panchayati  structure fell short of Gandhian ideals of democratic self-governance as more powerful and wealthy participants tended to undermine proposals that would have improved equality (Immerwahr, 2015, p. 92). 
 Parthasarathy and Rao conclude that “The modern  gram sabha  was pioneered by the Government of Karnataka, which passed an act in 1985 establishing democratically elected  mandal panchayats  (a  mandal  consisted of several villages), with clearly delineated functions and appropriate budgets” (Parthasarathy &amp; Rao, 2017). The  sabhas  were held twice a year to develop annual plans for the village, review development programs, and determine beneficiaries (Aziz, 2000). Village councillors resented the  sabhas  because they provided a forum in which councillors could be held accountable through questioning. As a result,  gram sabhas  were undermined as meetings after 1985 were increasingly held without advance notice or held in locations that could only accommodate small numbers of participants (Crook &amp; Manor, 1998). The shortcomings of  gram sabhas  in practice spurred a movement that succeeded in embedding the three-tier system of decentralization and deliberative institutions Article 40 of the Constitution. 
 Participant Recruitment and Selection 
 The constitutional requirement for the decentralization of power and the  gram sabhas  only applies to rural India. Article 40 mandates that all Indian villages have an elected village council as the executive body and the  gram sabha  as a legislative body. The  gram sabha  meets at least twice a year and all citizens with the right to vote are members of the  sabha . 
 The Gram Sabhas are open meetings, presided by local elected officials. They are always held on holidays, and in public buildings or open spaces. Preparations for the assemblies include publicity, and the distribution of various planning documents. Minutes are kept, and each sub-sector group presents a report of its deliberations and produces a list of “felt needs."" 
 How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making 
 A growing body of research examines the deliberative quality of the  sabha . Deliberation in  sabhas  is often shaped by existing hierarchies and social inequalities as elites and men often dominate discussion. Discourse often appears in a form that is distinct from early ideal theories of deliberation, featuring claims about identity, emotionally-charged rhetoric, and demands based on individual self-interest. 
 Rao and Sanyal (2009) find that  gram sabhas  provide opportunities for the poor to say things that they might be unable to say in other contexts. This is because political elites are less likely to retaliate against citizens who speak up publicly in deliberative forums due to the electoral costs they might face in response. Many of the sensitive issues raised in  gram sabhas  have to do with demands for social inclusion, although these may shift to other matters of public concern once literacy rates increase sufficiently to reduce inequalities of inclusion (Sanyal, Rao, &amp; Majumdar, 2009). 
 The quality of deliberation in  sabhas  – particularly in regard to holding elected officials accountable – may also be hampered by limited access to information (Chattopadhyay &amp; Bhattacharjee, 2015). An analysis of transcripts from deliberations in West Bengal reveals that villagers attempt to use media reports to demand further information, but their requests are often ignored (Chattopadhyay &amp; Bhattacharjee, 2015). Demands for individual entitlements have also been charged with limiting the ability of the  sabha  to reach reasonable group decisions. 
 However, Ban, Jha, and Rao’s (2012) analysis of transcripts suggests that discussion in  gram sabhas  is similar to those observed in other well-functioning democracies. Rather than cheap talk or elite domination, deliberation largely meets common democratic standards. 
 This is not to say there are no challenges to the quality of deliberation. For one, where there is less caste heterogeneity, elite domination is more likely (Ban et al., 2012). Additionally, participation appears to be gendered as women appear less likely to attend meetings of the  gram sabha  (Ban &amp; Rao, 2008; Chattopadhyay &amp; Duflo, 2004), to take part in community resource management (Agarwal, 2001), or run for local office. Quotas, or ‘reservations’ in the Indian context, are intended to prevent domination of the  gram sabha  and preserve its capacity to check privileged groups. 
 Reservations do not appear to increase the number of female citizens who attend or speak at these meetings. However, when the president of a  gram sabha  is a woman, it is more likely that women will be able to effectively set the agenda (Parthasarathy, Rao, &amp; Palaniswamy, 2017a). An alternative strategy to address gendered inequalities can be found in self-help groups (SHGs), which appear to contribute to improving the oral competency for female speakers (Sanyal, Rao, &amp; Prabhakar, 2015). While these groups primarily focus on providing rural women with credit, there is optimism that they can also generate social capital that might motivate political activity from the bottom-up. Many SHGs were limited in their capacity to build networks that moved beyond the local context and failed to include the poorest women. The Pudhu Vaazhvu Project (PVP) was designed to explicitly address these problems by creating a federation of SHGs specifically to reduce poverty. These projects appear to have succeeded in improving womens’ participation, doubling the number of female attendees at the  gram sabha  and increases both the number of female citizens who speak and the amount of time for which they hold the floor (Parthasarathy, Rao, &amp; Palaniswamy, 2017b). 
 Influence, Outcomes, and Effects 
 There is a substantial body of scholarship examining the  gram sabha ’s use in Tamil Nadu and, Karnataka. Evidence drawn from thousands of households over hundreds of villages in various Indian states finds that the quality of governance improves when  gram sabhas  are held as scheduled (Besley, Pande, &amp; Rao, 2005; Crook &amp; Manor, 1998). For instance, policies that provide access to Below Poverty Line (BPL) cards that provide public benefits are substantially better targeted to citizens in need when  gram sabhas  are held. This is because  gram sabhas  are charged with ratifying the BPL lists, which provides citizens with the opportunity to deliberate about definitions of poverty and create opportunities for the poor to increase their capacity to challenge the government (Rao &amp; Sanyal, 2009). 
 Considerable attention has also been given to the use of the  gram sabha  in Kerala, India’s most literate state. Prior to the codification of the requirement to hold  gram sabhas  in the Constitution, Kerala had already developed a program of participatory democracy – the  Kerala People’s Campaign for Decentralized Planning  – that accorded a key role to the g ram sabha . Deliberation here is divided between various groups and committees based on resources, rather than organized as an open deliberation. The  gram sabhas  are accompanied by working committees and ‘development seminars’ that seek to raise awareness and educate citizens about their rights and capacities to participate in processes of deliberation. 
 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 The example of the  gram sabha  provides a valuable corrective to theories of deliberative democracy that focus on rational argumentation and its preconditions. Instead, Sanyal et al. (2015) suggest that  gram sabhas  serve as valuable examples of “oral democracy,” in which the equal right to participate in talk-centric institutions is seen as a way of deepening democracy. This highlights the importance of oral competency, the “capability of speaking in public in civic settings in a manner that is effective in eliciting a response, generating a discussion, and reaching a decision” (Sanyal, Rao, &amp; Prabhakar, 2015, p. 4). Such a view emphasizes the value of institutions and forms of citizen participation that perhaps do not meet the idealized requirements of deliberative democrats, but still empower citizens against otherwise powerful elites.

 The Mary Robinson Foundation for Climate Justice adopted the  Principles of Climate Justice  as their guiding principles. They adopted these principles because climate justice links human rights and development to safeguard the rights of the most vulnerable. Additionally, the Principles of Climate Justice help ensure that solutions are equally equitable and fair.[1] 
 The Mary Robinson Foundation for Climate Justice also used three core pillars for their working methods: thought leadership, bridging, and convening. These three pillars have allowed the foundation to be successful in their work, ensuring a ‘leave no one behind’ approach is taken to climate change discussions and development polices. [1] 
 Origins and Development 
 The Mary Robinson Foundation Method has been used by the organization since 2010.  The method was developed because of the organizations unique postion in civil society and policy-makers. [1] 
 Participant Recruitment and Selection 
 How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making 
 The Mary Robinson Foundation Method is focused on bringing together multi-disciplinary stakeholders. It is a people-centred approach that is informed by human rights. Thought LeadershipThis pillar refers to the organization working with thought leaders in their field of expertise. These individuals/organization are informed and can be considered the ‘go-to’ people in their field for their expertise opinions. Mary Robinson Foundation is considered to be a thought leader on issues of climate justice and climate change action. Part of thought leadership is helping generate ideas, as we as action to make those ideas become a reality. Thought leadership also refers to seeking out experts in certain field for their opinions, which promotes collaboration and working together across fields. BridgingThis pillar refers to linking/bringing together unconnected things. In the Mary Robinson Foundation for Climate Justice’s work this often means bringing grassroots movements for climate justice together with world leaders and policy makers. Bridging is a powerful message to bring together different areas of expertise to create powerful change. Bridging moves away from the soiled approach. ConveningThe third, and final pillar, is convening. Convening refers to bringing people, from different fields and sectors, to meet and discuss climate action. Convening is one of the foundations key methods. The foundation identified the power convening has to bring an unusual mix of actors together to start dialogue and seek solutions to climate change.

Those invited will be excited to attend and will feel honored to have been included. Help People DecideAn invitation should also gives those who are not interested in the event permission to miss it. While they should not put undo pressure on recipients, invitations should attempt to draw people who would not normally attend similar events or who are not already actively engaged in the issues under discussion.Explain the Way it WorksRegardless of the event or process methodology, invitations should describe the issues under discussion and the participatory process in a way that tells recipients what they are being asked to do, how they will be participating, and whether there are other opportunities to get involved. A good explanation may involve: how the event will affect the invited person, their family, and their community; 
 how the event will give those invited the chance to have a say on the issue(s) and which days they’ll need to attend in order to present their opinion or solution; 
 what the objective of each meeting will be, whether it will be a stating of the problem, a brainstorming session with others, or a resolution meeting. Continue the EngagementJust because the invitations have been sent doesn’t mean the excitement should end. Restating the purpose of the event during the opening remarks will help focus the discussions. Reminding attendees of the intended purpose of the event will also make it easier to refocus everyone if people stray off topic.

You can help Participedia by adding to it.Problems and Purpose 
 The Feminist Data Toolkit is designed to collect gender data in the best way possible. The method focuses on using applied enthnography (""thick data"") to develop trust with women and their local communties. 
 Origins and Development 
 Ladysmith Ventures created the Feminist Data Toolkit to help policymakers, program designers, and social movements use gender data. 
 Participant Recruitment and Selection 
 The Feminist Data Toolkit uses 4 main methods to enagage with participants. 
 1. Applied enthography (""Thick Data"") 
 The goal of this is to develop trust with women and their local communities. The requires immersing in women's everyday lives, listening, and observing. 
 2. ""No research about us, without us."" 
 This serves as a reminder that women need to be involved in the whole research process. 
 3. Combining big data with ""thick"" data 
 Combining big statistical data with what has been learned by applied enthography and thick data to evaluate the quality of the statisical data. Using thick data, together with statisitcal data, can help show what is missing with statisitcal data. 
 4. Telling women's stories 
 It is important to put gender data in the political, economic, and historical context. Communicating gender data in ways that compel people to take action is important. 
 How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making 
 Influence, Outcomes, and Effects 
 Creating powerful gender data and presenting it in ways that comples people to take action can help make more effective policy briefs, research projects and reports, editorials, etc.

Please help us complete it.Problems and Purpose  The Principles of Climate Justice were developed to guide the actions and activities of the Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice but are applicable to the work of any organization or individual looking to take a human-centred approach to the issue of climate change and environmental stewardship. The Principles are not a method but a guiding philosophy, used to inform development work, dialogue, and decision-making. [1]  Origins and Development  The Principles of Climate Justice were developed during a meeting in July 2011 between the board members of the Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice and other leaders and practitioners in the field of climate justice. [1]  How it Works  Taken together, the Principles of Climate Justice represent a framework or guiding philosophy from which to draw on when acting in pursuit of equitable solutions to the issue of climate change.  The following was written by the Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice and can be found  on their website:   These principles are rooted in the frameworks of international and regional human rights law and do not require the breaking of any new ground on the part of those who ought, in the name of climate justice, to be willing to take them on.Respect and Protect Human RightsThe international rights framework provides a reservoir for the supply of legal imperatives with which to frame morally appropriate responses to climate change, rooted in equality and justice.  The idea of human rights point societies towards internationally agreed values around which common action can be negotiated and then acted upon. Human rights yardsticks deliver valuable minimal thresholds, legally defined, about which there is widespread consensus. The guarantee of basic rights rooted in respect for the dignity of the person which is at the core of this approach makes it an indispensable foundation for action on climate justice.Support the Right to DevelopmentThe vast gulf in resources between rich and poor, evident in the gap between countries in the North and South and also within many countries (both North and South) is the deepest injustice of our age. This failure of resource-fairness makes it impossible for billions of humans to lead decent lives, the sort of life-opportunities that a commitment to true equality should make an absolute essential.  Climate change both highlights and exacerbates this gulf in equality. It also provides the world with an opportunity. Climate change highlights our true interdependence and must lead to a new and respectful paradigm of sustainable development, based on the urgent need to scale up and transfer green technologies and to support low carbon climate resilient strategies for the poorest so that they become part of the combined effort in mitigation and adaptation.Share Benefits and Burdens EquitablyThe benefits and burdens associated with climate change and its resolution must be fairly allocated. This involves acceptance of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities in relation to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Those who have most responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions and most capacity to act must cut emissions first.  In addition, those who have benefited and still benefit from emissions in the form of on-going economic development and increased wealth, mainly in industrialised countries, have an ethical obligation to share benefits with those who are today suffering from the effects of these emissions, mainly vulnerable people in developing countries. People in low income countries must have access to opportunities to adapt to the impacts of climate change and embrace low carbon development to avoid future environmental damage.Ensure that Decisions on Climate Change are Participatory, Transparent and AccountableThe opportunity to participate in decision-making processes which are fair, accountable, open and corruption-free is essential to the growth of a culture of climate justice. The voices of the most vulnerable to climate change must be heard and acted upon. A basic of good international practice is the requirement for transparency in decision-making, and accountability for decisions that are made. It must be possible to ensure that policy developments and policy implementation in this field are seen to be informed by an understanding of the needs of low income countries in relation to climate justice, and that these needs are adequately understood and addressed.  Decisions on policies with regard to climate change taken in a range of fora from the UNFCCC to trade, human rights, business, investment and development must be implemented in a way that is transparent and accountable: poverty can never be an alibi for government failure in this sphere.Highlight Gender Equality and EquityThe gender dimension of climate change, and in turn climate justice, must be highlighted. The impacts of climate changes are different for women and men, with women likely to bear the greater burden in situations of poverty.  Women’s voices must be heard and their priorities supported as part of climate justice. In many countries and cultures, women are at the forefront of living with the reality of the injustices caused by climate change. They are critically aware of the importance of climate justice in contributing to the right to development being recognised and can play a vital role as agents of change within their communities.Harness the Transformative Power of Education for Climate StewardshipThe transformative power of education under-pins other principles, making their successful adoption more likely and inculcating into cultures a deeper awareness of human rights and climate justice than is presently to be found. To achieve climate stabilisation will necessitate radical changes in lifestyle and behaviour and education has the power to equip future generations with the skills and knowledge they will need to thrive and survive.  As well as being a fundamental human right which is already well developed in the international framework of rights referred to above, education is indispensable to the just society. It draws those in receipt of it towards a fuller understanding of the world about them, deepening their awareness both of themselves and of those around them. Done well, it invites reflection on ethics and justice that make the well-educated also good citizens, both of their home state and (in these global times) of the world as well.  Delivered in an effective multi-disciplinary school, college or university environmental education can increase consciousness of climate change, producing new insights not only at the scientific but also at the sociological and political level. Education is also achievable outside the formal system, through public and, increasingly, virtual (i.e. web-based) activity. The learning required to see climate change in justice terms cannot be done at the schools and university alone: it is a life-long responsibility and therefore a commitment.Use Effective Partnerships to Secure Climate JusticeThe principle of partnership points in the direction of solutions to climate change that are integrated both within states and across state boundaries.  Climate justice requires effective action on a global scale which in turn requires a pooling of resources and a sharing of skills across the world. The nation state may remain the basic building block of the international system but without openness to coalitions of states and corporate interests and elements within civil society as well, the risk is that the whole house produced by these blocks will be rendered uninhabitable. Openness to partnership is a vital aspect of any coherent approach to climate change, and in the name of climate justice, this must also involve partnership with those most affected by climate change and least able adequately to deal with it – the poor and under-resourced.[1]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  See AlsoMary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice The Mary Robinson Foundation Approach to Climate Justice   References  [1] ""Principles of Climate Justice,""  Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice,  Nov 7 2015, https://www.mrfcj.org/principles-of-climate-justice/  External Links  https://www.mrfcj.org/principles-of-climate-justice/  Notes  Lead image: Neville Elder/ The Elders, Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice https://goo.gl/P9Eioc ",1,0,0,1,0,

5450,method,National Public Policy Conferences (Brazil),https://participedia.net/method/5450,National Public Policy Conferences are a participatory methodology involving deliberation which is used for citizens to engage in formulating public policy at the state level in Brazil.,0,2010-09-29,2020-09-01,199,Thamypog,https://participedia.net/user/199,417734,"""Jaskiran Gakhal Participedia Team""",https://participedia.net/user/417734,en,1,facetoface,involve,open_to,,polarized,,collaborative, deliberative,,large,,,national, regional,,discussion, express,,voting, general,,,,make, make_influence, develop," Problems and Purpose  The national public policy conferences (conferências nacionais de políticas públicas), are arguably the largest and most innovative participatory experience currently being held in Brazil. The national conferences consist of spheres of  deliberation  and participation designed to provide guidelines for the formulation of public policy by the public policy councils at the federal level. They are summoned to convene by the Executive branch through its ministries and secretariats, are organized by relevant  public policy council , and involve the equal participation of representatives from the government and civil society. The national conferences are as a rule preceded by rounds at the municipal, state or regional levels, and the aggregate results of the deliberations occurring during those stages are the object of deliberation in the national conference, attended by the delegates from the previous rounds. At the end, a final document containing the guidelines for the design of public policy is produced, as the result of a long process of deliberation and  consensus  formation between government and civil society.[1]  Origins and Development  The first national conference was held in 1941, but since then the breadth, range, inclusivity and frequency have increased, both following the 1988 Constitution as well as after Lula took office as president in 2003.  In the period between 1941 and 1988, the national conferences were greatly restricted to  health-related issues . There were a total of 12 national conferences in Brazil in that period, 8 of which were specifically on health, and the remainder were in health-related issues.[2] In comparison, between 1988 and 2009, 80 national conferences[3] were held.[4] The conferences started to encompass more issues, such as human rights and social assistance, and become increasingly institutionalized in the latter half of the 1990s.  Between 1988 and 2009, the wide range of public policy areas covered by the conferences added up to thirty-three issues, which have been categorized into six thematic groups in Pogrebinschi’s research (2010):[5]Health: General Health; Dental Health; Workers’ Health; Indigenous Health; Mental Health; Environmental Health; Science, Technology and Innovation in Health; Administration of Healthcare Education and Work; Drugs and Pharmaceutical Care;  Minorities: Rights of the Elderly; Rights of Persons with Disabilities; Gays, Lesbians, Bissexuals, Transvestites and Transsexuals; Indigenous Peoples; Public Policies for Women; Child and Adolescent Rights; Youth; Promotion of Racial Equality; Brazilian Communities Abroad;  Environment  State, Economy and Development: Solidarity Economy; Aquaculture and Fisheries; Sustainable and Solidary Rural Development; Food and Nutrition Security; Cities; Public Security; Communication;  Education, Culture, Social Services and Sports: Basic Education; Professional and Technological Education; Indigenous Education; Culture; Sports; Social Services;  Human RightsSpecifically, out of the 33 policy issues deliberated in national conferences, 22 were introduced in Lula’s government, from 2003 onwards and until 2009, a 7-year period. Pogrebinschi’s analysis shows that since 2003, the national conferences have become broader, wider-ranging, more inclusive, and more frequent; in addition, and as a consequence they have also undergone a deliberative and normative turn.[6]  The conferences have become broader due to its increased number of participants, both at the national level as well as the preceding municipal, state and/or regional levels, and in parallel virtual conferences, when they occur. They have become wider-ranging due to the increased number of issues they encompass. From the 33 issues outlined above, only 11 of these issues convened national conferences before 2003. Only 25 out of the 80 conferences held between 1988 and 2009 were held in the 15-year period between 1988 and before 2003, whereas the other 55 were held in the 7-year period between 2003 and 2009, in the Lula government.[7] In particular, almost all conferences under the issues of minorities, education, culture, social services and sports, state, economy and development and environment were developed in the Lula government period.  The national conferences have also become more inclusive as a result of their increased range and breadth, as they assemble more diverse and heterogeneous social groups, especially representatives of civil society originating from NGOs, social movements, labor unions, business associations and other entities, professional or not. Civil society has become decisive in proposing new areas of policies, being allowed to define the policy agenda. The conferences have also become a space of cooperation among social and political actors that go beyond electoral bounds and party compromises. The conferences have become more frequent, as their resolutions have incorporated criteria for periodic reconvening, being sustained by the policies of ministries, secretariats, national councils and working groups involved in its organization and in some cases in legislation which establish that some must be held biannually.[8]  After Lula took office in 2003, such participative conference processes have undergone a deliberative and normative turn. The conferences became deliberative due to their orientation towards consensus formation in the context of a diverse group of participants in a process of public justification of arguments. They also became normative in the sense that deliberations lead to the elaboration of a final document, debated, voted on and approved through different strategies and methods of consolidating preferences; that way, conferences create expectations that are not just cognitive, but also normative, in those who were involved in the process and also in those who, although have not participated directly, will be affected by the eventual consequences of the respective policies.[9]  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Official data estimates that about five million people have participated in the 73 national policy conferences that took place since 2003. These people are distributed in all levels comprised by the conference process. Such a process involves the deliberation that starts in the local (municipal) or regional (aggregation of municipalities) levels, continues in all the 27 states, and is concluded in the national conference that is usually held in Brasília, the country’s capital. Some national conferences also preview upon convocation the undertaking of ‘free conferences’ that may be organized by any groups in civil society, and of ‘virtual conferences’ that reunite contributions submitted over the internet. Once a formal procedure is followed, the results of the free and virtual conferences are taken into consideration in the basis-document that will be deliberated on the national level, along with the results from the local, regional and state conferences.[10]  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The national conferences themselves usually last three or four days, the entire process taking over a year to be completed. Every national conference begins to be prepared by the moment the executive act that summons it to convene is enacted, and the commission that will coordinate it is installed. This commission is constituted by members of the government and of civil society, at all levels (some have a three-part composition, the third being constituted by representatives of the relevant workers/professional associations of the policy area under discussion). A very planned and detailed agenda follows the enactment of the internal rules that will organize the process, as well as the methodology that will be used to aggregate the deliberations from all levels to the last, national one.[11]  There is not a single methodology that is applied to all conferences, and some of them involve very complex systems of preference prioritization (instead of simple preference aggregation) which are applied both in the several stages of a single conference (from working group deliberations to the final plenary) and in the several stages that precedes the national one. No guidelines approved in the local, regional, or state levels are excluded from the deliberation that takes place in the national conference, and even conflicting guidelines approved in the different levels are resubmitted to deliberation in the national stage. Even when the deliberation ends on voting, as happens in the final plenary that concludes the national conferences, majority is not the rule: an equal proportion of votes among State and civil society delegates must be achieved in order to form a consensus and have a policy guideline included in the final report.[12]  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  The conferences have been decisive to increase the (participative and deliberative) design and implementation of national level public policies in general, and, in particular, in areas where there were yet no national policies implemented by the Executive. Recent examples of the latter fact would include the conferences on food and nutritional security, which brought to light the first national policy in this area enacted in August 2010; the national conference on youth which decisively contributed to the drafting of a first national policy on youth which is currently being examined by the Congress; the national conferences on culture that helped to design the national policy of culture that is presently in its last stages of deliberation in the Congress; and the national conference on public security which was convened with the precise purpose of providing guidelines for the drafting of the first national policy of public security.[13]  The impact of the national policy conferences in the Legislature is also a growing reality. The final report containing policy guidelines approved by the conferences activate and impel the legal activity of the Congress, and its effect on lawmaking can be measured by the number of bills proposed and statutes enacted, as well as by the content addressed in them. As shown by research coordinated by Pogrebinschi (2010), from 1988 to 2009, about 19.8% of all bills proposed in the Congress were substantively convergent with the national conferences policy guidelines, and the same is true for about 48.5% of the constitutional bills. As for the approved legislation, 7.2% of all statutes and 15.8% of all constitutional amendments enacted by the Parliament can be said to deal with specific issues deliberated by the national conferences.[14]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Pogrebinchi’s studies (2010) on the National Conferences analyze the impact of the national conferences on legislative activities in the National Congress between 1998 and 2009. The research shows that these conferences influence and inform legislative activity in the National Congress, thus strengthening, through a participative and deliberative practice, representative democracy in Brazil.[15] Pogrebinschi stresses the need to recognize these new mechanisms of participative democracy as inherently part of representative democracy and contributing to its further legitimization.[16]  Pogrebinschi’s research has resulted in the construction of a database, ISEGORIA[17], accessible to the public, with the resolutions of the national conferences, and which summarized the legislative activity of the National Congress, including proposed bills, proposals to amend the constitution, laws, and the actual amendments to the constitution. The database allows for an advanced search, in categories such as: national conference, year, theme addressed, and thematic category. Apart from that, it also allows for the search through key words, of which results show relevant legislative outcomes. In addition to the information available in ISEGORIA, the database used for Pogrebinschi’s research includes the guidelines produced by the national conferences. A total of 1953 guidelines were categorized: 406 in the area of health; 349 in the category of minorities; 178 in environment; 307 in state, economy and development; 195 in education, culture, social services and sports; and 518 in human rights.[18]  In addition, the research finds that the involvement of the Legislature with themes pertinent to the national conferences only become more significant after the first mandate of president Fernando Henrique Cardoso (FHC), and even more prominently during the presidency of Luís Inácio Lula da Silva, when there is an explosion in legislative production relevant to the guidelines produced by the national conference, summing up to 2233 bills proposals beginning to be processed by the two houses of Congress, as well as 163 Constitutional Amendment bill proposals, 216 statues enacted and actual constitutional amendments between 2003 and 2008, compared to 494 in FHC’s mandate between 1994 and 2002.[19] These findings point to the fact that from 2002, when Lula is elected and the dominant coalition in Congress has the Workers’ Party (PT) and the rest of the leftist parties as main actors, not only do the national conferences become more effective and present in the political scene, but the reinforcement between representative and participatory dimensions of democracy became more solid.[20]  Although the execution of the conferences and the implementation of its results are not, with a few exceptions, bound by law and depend, therefore, on the political will of the federal governments, the same are already found greatly institutionalized in order to have some autonomy within the State itself.[21] Because they became institutionalized as part of the process of formulation and monitoring of public policies of the Executive Branch, and, therefore, as part of its structure, the national conferences generate consequences that impact the formation of the Legislative agenda, which can use it as informational basis, be it as a mechanism of legitimization through participation, or as deliberative inputs of its own representative activity.[22]  See AlsoPublic Policy Council (Brazil)   References  [1] ↑ Pogrebinschi, Thamy.

Before the open access model existed, almost all peer-reviewed articles based on scholarly research were published in print journals whose subscription fees could be prohibitively expensive—despite the fact that authors are not paid for their articles.  These journals were generally only available to the general public at well-funded university libraries, primarily in the developed world. This meant that doctors treating patients with HIV and AIDS in remote regions of Africa, for instance, often could not access complete articles describing the results of the latest medical research on treatments, even when the research upon which these articles were based was undertaken locally.  Origins and Development  Concentrated, collaborative, international work on the open access model accelerated significantly after December 2001, when an Open Society Foundations–sponsored meeting in Budapest developed a statement of principles on open access to research literature. This statement, theBudapest Open Access Initiative,[2] called for radical change to a $10 billion industry by creating new open access journals and urging researchers to report the results of their work in institutional archives.  However, two subsequent initiatives which were inspired by the Budapest Open Access Initiative—the Bethesda Statement from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute; and the Berlin Declaration, which originated from the Max Planck Society—broadened and strengthened the base of support for open access. Scholarly researchers, libraries, students, patient advocates, and small businesses, among others, have organized their members and driven the effort to implement the open access model.  How it Works  Currently, there are more than 12,000 academic journals accessible in theDirectory of Open Access Journals, and more than 3,500 archives are included in theDirectory of Open Access Repositories. About 28 percent of peer-reviewed articles today are open access, and the number is increasing with each passing year.  Research funders are playing an increasingly important role in accelerating the adoption of Open Access. The Wellcome Trust in the United Kingdom has lead the way, becoming the world’s first funder to mandate open access for publication of the research it funds. Scores of other research funders—including the largest funder of research in the world, the United States. National Institutes of Health—have subsequently implemented similar policies. In 2013, meanwhile, the Obama Administrationissued anexecutive directive[3]instructing all U.S. science funding agencies to provide public access to federally supported research outputs.  Academic and research institutions have also embraced open access, with faculty at more than 850 colleges and universities voting to adopt campus-wide open access policies. Harvard, MIT, the University of Nairobi, and the entire University of California System have joined the ranks of institutions that have open access mandates.  Organizations such as Open Society Foundations, support the organizations spearheading the development of open access policies and practices, such as the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition in North America (SPARC North America), the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition in Europe (SPARC Europe), the Electronic Information for Libraries, and the student-led Right to Research Coalition. These grantees have championed open access in North America, Europe, and over 45 developing and transition countries.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  To make open access the default for scholarly publishing, the movement is working to align incentives so that scholars can share their work openly and construct affordable, sustainable, and equitable business models.

5507,method,Sortition,https://participedia.net/method/5507,"Sortition is the selection of candidates by lot, and was used in ancient Athenian democracy. When selecting participants for citizens' assemblies, the random selection is followed by stratification of candidates according to demographics like age, gender, location, and education.",0,2018-11-13,2024-01-20,110904,"""Scott Fletcher Bowlsby""",https://participedia.net/user/110904,425982,"""Deborah W.A. Foulkes""",https://participedia.net/user/425982,en,,both,consult,limited,random,polarized,high,deliberative, planning,,,,,city/town, national, regional,,,,,,,,,make, academic, develop," Problems and Purpose  While typically defined as the 'drawing of lots', sortition, as it is used in the context of government or public participation, uses stratified random sampling so that the demographic composition of the sample matches that of the population. Sortition thus attempts to overcome the potential for one or more demographics to be over-represented in a purely random sample. Achieving representation is important because demographic factors or characteristics such as socio-economic status, race, and gender, can be more or less advantageous to an individual's attainment of public office or ability to participate in politics. [1]  In general, the final selection of participants through stratified random sampling is proportionately representative of the population on at least three dimensions — age, geographic location or area of residence, and highest level of education — and is composed of half men and half women.  There are both advantages and disadvantages to the stratified random sampling technique:  ""Advantages of stratified random samplingStratified random sampling gives you a systematic way of gaining a population sample that takes into account the demographic make-up of the population, which leads to stronger research results.  The method is fair for participants as the sample from each stratum can be randomly selected, meaning there is no bias in the process.  As participant grouping must be exhaustive and mutually exclusive, stratified random sampling removes variation and the chances of overlap between each stratum.  Lastly, it helps with efficient and accurate data collection. Having a smaller, more relevant sample to work with means a more manageable and affordable research project.Disadvantages of stratified random samplingResearchers may hold prior knowledge of the population’s shared characteristics beforehand, which increases the risk for selection bias when strata are defined.  There is more administration to do to conduct this process, so researchers must include this extra time and order.  When randomly sampling each stratum, the resulting sample may not be representative of the full population. It is worth reviewing the results to see if the sample is proportional to the whole population.  Once you have the final sample, data analysis of the information becomes more complicated to take into account the layers of the stratum.""[2]Origins and Development  Sortition has a long history, going back at least to Ancient Athens, where selection by lot (from among all free, male citizens) was the principal way courts and councils were filled. For hundreds of years, it was considered a fundamental aspect of democracy; it wasn't until long after the French and American revolutions, as universal suffrage slowly became widespread, that the term ""democracy"" was re-christened to mean electoral democracy.[3]  How it Works  Sortition involves the drawing of a representative, random sample of participants for inclusion in a forum of governance. Individuals selected through sortition are typically invited to make decisions or collective judgment through an informed, deliberative, and fair process. The key aspect of sortition compared to other techniques of participant recruitment or selection, is the equal probability of any person being chosen for the  assembly . Practitioners who adopt sortition for their event or intiative do so as a way to ensure the final group selected is half women, half men, with proportional representation for the young and old, and across all geographical areas and educational levels. It may also include an attitudinal stratification criterion related to the topic of the assembly, e.g. acceptance of the science behind climate change vs. climate denialism for a climate assembly.[4]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  In his presentation at the 67th Political Science Association Annual International Conference, University of Lausanne's Dmititri Courant makes the following conclusions when comparing sortition to three other forms of selection: election, nomination, and certification:""If we want representatives who look like the represented, in the logic of “descriptive representation”, we shall choose sortition, getting closer to the democratic ideal of “government by the People”. If we prefer socially distinct elites we shall choose election, which is an aristocratic view. If we think that leaders should choose the representatives, we shall adopt nomination, in an oligarchic perspective. If we want qualified representatives we shall select through certification, leaning towards technocracy.""[5]  ""The main experiments of sortition have been either a  jury  from 12 to 30 citizens, or a larger  assembly , 160 in  British Columbia  and 1 200 in Iceland. Those conferences and assemblies always had a consulting role and never made the final decision, this one being either submitted to the elected parliament, or directly proposed to  referendum ...[S]ortition is almost always proposed as a complement to add along with election and not as a complete replacement; there is almost no one for a total suppression of election.""[6]  ""History shows us that in every political system based on sortition, there always was short mandate and a rotation principle. Whether it is in Ancient Greece, Medieval Italy, the Crown of Aragon, the popular jury or even recent mini-publics, the terms of randomly selected representatives are always short. Lots and short term allows a quick rotation of the representatives; on the contrary, election favour re-elections, certification is easily passed by the aristoï, and nomination maintains small circles of initiates. Temporality is crucial to avoid “oligarchisation”. The strongest historical example mixing sortition, short term and rotation to avoid political professionalization is Athenian Democracy, where the members of 500 Council only allowed a single one year term throughout their lives.""[7]  Regardless of the selection method, ""[r]ecall revocation by popular referendum, citizens’ control during the term, serious accountability and sanctions should be basic institutions of a democratic system.""[8]  ""Regardless of the mode of selection or the sphere, there is always a delimitation of the “relevant political body” aiming to determine which criteria allows you to be part of the “pool”, to be concerned with the selection process...For most of sortition experiences and theories, the pool for the lottery consists of all the citizens of the given geographical constituency, but it is sometimes even more inclusive.""[9]See AlsoCivic Lottery Demarchy   References  [1] Dunlop, Tim. “Voting Undermines the Will of the People – It’s Time to Replace It with Sortition | Tim Dunlop.”  The Guardian .

 GetVokl was designed to address two problems of the modern digital age: algorithmic filtering and inauthentic representations of the self through social media. 
 Social media algorithms are designed to filter content based on a user’s predicted likes and interests. The resulting ‘filter-bubbles’ have created online spaces ‘safe’ from opposing opinions or view points. Users in each bubble interact in ‘echo chambers’ with like-minded individuals who reinforce, justify, and support one another's opinions and biases with no access to dissenting or challenging voices or information.[1] 
 The problem of inauthentic representation on social media accrues from the ability and predilection of users to carefully curate and edit that which they make public. Pictures, profile information, and posts are thus only the ‘tip of the iceberg’ with the complex realities of an individual's’ life hidden from public view.[2] What results is two-fold: first, a false sense of reality in which everyone is always ‘at their best’. This can lead to an unhealthy self-image and pressures to conform.[3] Second, communication and interaction between users is ‘thin’: based on limited information of ‘the other’, devoid of the empathy and understanding inherent in face-to-face conversation, and which can lead to volatile exchanges on divisive subjects.[4, 5] 
 In response, the GetVokl online tool brings face-to-face interaction back to the internet. GetVokl give provides a safe space where users can be their ‘authentic selves’ and engage in moderated conversations on difficult subjects. 
 Origins and Development 
 GetVokl was originally conceived as a “healthy” social media platform: consisting of focused, structured conversation and break out rooms. Since its founding in 2015, GetVokl has evolved to be a platform where anyone can bring a meeting, a town hall or a collaborative together in one open source format. Marketing itself as a kind of “social television”, GetVokl allows diverse groups of people to interact around specific topics in communities created and maintained by ‘thought leaders’. 
 How it Works 
 GetVokl is open to anyone with an internet connection. Users must verify their identities to sign up - with either a mobile phone number or Facebook account. Once registered, users can either join an ongoing conversation ‘broadcast’ or start a private room and invite guests through link-sharing.[6] 
 Broadcasts allow hosts to create an open, topic-based conversation available on the GetVokl homepage and streamed simultaneously across Facebook Live, YouTube Live, Periscope, and Twitter. Users must apply for broadcasting privileges and they are granted at the discretion of GetVokl outreach management. Those with the ability to broadcast can also record and save their broadcasts on their personal channel.[6] 
 Broadcasts and channels are grouped around topics including: coaching, culture, education, entertainment, mental health, movies &amp; TV, politics, religion &amp; spritiuality, science &amp; tech, sports, and other.[7] 
 Users may join live discussions if there are spots available. A host manages the conversation with up to three guests “on stage” (the live video feed) at a time. The host can cycle through the guests they bring on stage and all four can interact with each other via text in the chat box on the left of the screen. 
 Users can subscribe to broadcaster (host) channels to get notifications, updates, and reminders of upcoming conversations. Users can ‘follow’ and chat with other users that ‘follow’ them back’. 
 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 GetVokl has not yet undergone any academic study or analysis.

5594,method,"The Tuscany Regional Participation Policy, Italy",https://participedia.net/method/5594,The Tuscany Regional Participation Policy (TRPP) is an innovative tool which creates a legal framework to institutionalize public participation and consultation into regional and local decision-making.,0,2019-02-01,2021-05-03,110904,"""Scott Fletcher Bowlsby""",https://participedia.net/user/110904,417734,"""Jaskiran Gakhal Participedia Team""",https://participedia.net/user/417734,en,,,,limited,,low,high,,,,,,,regional, city/town,,discussion, ask,,,,,,,develop,,," Problems and Purpose  The Tuscany Regional Participation Policy (TRPP) is an innovative and important tool for the institutionalisation of public participation and deliberation within the region's political system. The TRPP is a pioneer initiative in the Italian and European context and it can be considered one of the first examples of participatory politics inspired by the concept of a ​​deliberative system. Through the Tuscan regional laws No 69/2007 and No 46/2013, the Tuscan system acts to promote participation as a regular form of government at multiple scales and involving various bodies and sectors of the public administration and civil society, at both the regional and local levels. Law 46/2013 strengthens its predecessor by providing the regional government with the legal mandate to actively “renew democracy and its institutions by integrating them with practices, processes and tools of participatory democracy."" Realized through this law, the TRPP seeks to contribute to the creation of ""greater social cohesion, through the diffusion of a culture of participation, and valuing all forms of civic engagement, knowledge and skills disseminated in society"".[1]  Origins and Development  Tuscany has gained international renown for its history of political activism and social mobilization[1]. Before being formally institutionalized in the Tuscany Regional Participation Policy (TRPP) participatory processes were actively implemented at the local level. The new regional participation policy simply engrains a trend which began in 2005, when the Governor Claudio Martini – inspired by experiences at the  World Social Forums  of Mumbai and Porto Alegre – agreed to create a legal framework strengthening the promotion of participation and transforming it in a cross-cutting routine for all regional policies.  From 2005 to 2007, the participatory policy was itself written through a  participatory process , engaging members of local governments, organizations, and the public through  workshops , public readings, electronic town meetings, etc. The two-year collective writing process culminated in Regional Law n. 69/2007, the first region-wide law on public participation in Italy. Its fundamental principle – sourced from numerous dialogues – lies in the belief that citizen participation is a basic right and it is therefore the duty of public institutions to provide the methods and tools necessary ""to make it effective."" Through this law, the regional government was to create the incentives necessary for the adoption of participatory processes and the development of a participatory culture in all localities and at all administrative levels under its jurisdiction.  Among other tools, Law n. 69/2007 provided for the creation of the "" Authority for the Promotion of Participation "" (APP): an independent body charged with the advancement of participatory culture, the granting of funds (around €750,000 per year), and the promotion of social dialogue through regular “calls for projects” three times per year.  Tuscany’s Regional Participatory Policy and the law which gave it political power reflect the understanding that there are no ‘ideal’ processes of participation, and that public institutions must foster and guarantee ""methodological pluralism” for engaging citizens in the construction of public policies and projects. Indeed, the law passed in 2007 was written with the express intent that it would expire at the end of 2012 to allow for a public reflection and  deliberation  on its benefits and the efficacy of its implementation. While the law was intended to expire, the  policy  was not; rather, amendments were to be made and a new, improved version was to be passed. In 2013, following a tense debate and a complex negotiation between the different political forces represented in the Tuscan Parliament – including the new Governor Enrico Rossi, initially skeptical of prolonging the life of Law n. 69 – the Law 69/2007 was amended and replaced by Regional Law 46/2013 thus continuing and strengthening the Regional Policy of Participation.Organizing, Supporting, and Funding EntitiesThe TRPP is an initiative of the  Regional Tuscany  government. The enactment of any parts of the policy are almost exclusively funded by the Regional Government although some projects may also receive funds from municipal governments and private companies. The realization of the TRPP is entrusted to the  Regional Authority for the Promotion of Participation  which owes its existence to Article 3 of the Law 46/2013.  How it Works  The goals of the TRPP are enacted through direct government action under the two Regional laws of participation: Law 69/2007 and Law 46/2013. While not participatory processes unto themselves, government policies and legislation that institutionalize or make space for public input and consultation within the existing political system can be considered ‘tools’ of public participation. The participatory methods and tools introduced into the political system through the legislation can vary. The most common method for the fulfillment of the TRPP is the ‘ Public Debate ’: ""a process of information, public comparison and participation"" on works, projects or interventions that are of particular relevance to the region's environment, territory, landscape, society, culture or economy. Debates usually take place in the preliminary stages of drafting a project and make use of a number of deliberative tools to engage the public including:The dissemination of technical documentation  Testimony and meetings with experts and scientistsThematic  forums, dialogues or other forms of discussion among citizens  The use of the Internet and new  information technologiesThe Law in Action: Process, Interaction, and Participation  Law 46/2013 is a powerful policy tool, giving the Regional government the legal mandate to “renew democracy and its institutions by integrating them with practices, processes and tools of participatory democracy."" Regional action in pursuit of the law’s fulfillment is, in reality, the pursuit of ""greater social cohesion, through the diffusion of a culture of participation, and valuing all forms of civic engagement, knowledge and skills disseminated in society.""[3]  The Law gives the Region broad powers of interpretation for its oversight and implementation including:Strengthening, through participation, the capacity of building, defining and implementing public policies;  Promoting participation as a regular form of administration and government;  Creating and promoting new forms of communication and exchange between institutions and society;  Valuing the skills, knowledge and competences existing in society, and making less represented interests more visible;  Developing and disseminating new technologies of information and communication as tools for democratic participation of citizens.  The new Regional Law does not simply replicate its predecessor. While the majority of it confirms the former’s goals and grants the same powers of implementation, the procedural aspects of monitoring and evaluation are clarified and expanded thanks to an analysis of those actions under the 2007 law conducted between 2012 and 2013.Coordination and ImplementationThe enactment of the TRPP is coordinated by Tuscany’s Regional Authority for the Promotion of Participation (APP). The APP is an independent government body created under Article 3 of Law 46/2013. Headed by three specialists in the field of public engagement, the APP’s work is aided by various regional government structures such as the  Giunta Regionale  (regional executive power), the regional Council of the Tuscan region (legislative power), the Guarantor for Communication and Participation for Territorial Policies, the local governments, and civil society organizations. The co-management of the TRPP is yet another defining feature of the policy: its implementation is itself a participatory exercise, including, as it does, numerous stakeholders and public agencies at all levels of government.  The main work of the APP comprises the annual selection of local and regional participatory projects. Proposed to the APP by Tuscan municipalities and regional civil society organizations, projects differ in scope, issue or topic, as well as methods of  deliberation , decisions, and public interaction. Another way the APP fulfills its duty in implementing the TRPP is through the promotion of Public Debates (inspired by the French model of debát public[3]) on large public works within the regional territory. Public Debates are mandatory on public projects valued ​​above 50,000,000 euros but can also be activated for smaller works if requested by other parties and approved by the APP.[4]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  In terms of implementation, it is important to point out the results obtained by the Tuscan law since 2007. From the regular ""call of projects"", the law has financed and promoted over 170 local and regional projects of social participation in the Tuscan territory. Any public debate has been developed until 2015, because their realization was not automatic in cases of major interventions in the law 69/2007. However, the law 46/2013 strengthened the instrument of public debate, making it obligatory for public works and projects from 50 million and voluntary in the case of private works of the same amount. Thus, 2016 saw the first regional public debate provided by the law (on  development of the new port of Livorno [5]) and other public debates are planned to occur in the near future.  The cross-cutting nature of participatory experiments in different sectors of the regional action increased recently, thanks to the creation of a Regional Ministry of Participation (which is in the hands of a powerful minister, also in charge of budget, financial issues and human resources) which collaborates with the APP for several events. It also funds “Open Toscana”, a web-platform that hosts free websites for all the participatory processes in the region, enabling open data.[6]Why is the TRPP innovative?I. The Tuscan experience can be considered a pioneer experiment of social participation guided by recent theories of deliberative systems.The TRPP has established itself as a pioneer and important example of institutionalization of social participation on a systemic level, in Italy and in Europe. The regional participation law was built from a specific participatory process and was aimed at promoting social participation as a regular form of government in Tuscany.  This innovative systemic character of the TRPP is illustrated by the existence of an institution formalized by law which operates in multiple spatial scales (local and regional), promoting participatory processes of various themes with a multitude of methods and acting in various complexity levels.  The systemic character of the law is also evident with the various regional government agencies included in its management, such as the Regional Council of  Tuscany region  (regional legislature), the regional Giunta (regional executive power), local governments as well as public authorities with some independence, such as the members of the APP and the regional guarantee of communication and participation.  The multi-scale and innovative character of the TRPP is exemplary for analysis of the forms of implementation of a deliberative system, as a theoretical body that represents a turn in the deliberative and participatory academic fields in recent years.II. The TRPP is an example of perennial institutionalized social participation.The transition from the first to the second regional law of social participation increased the level of institutionalization and rootedness in politics: the first law (69/2007) had a sunset clause. The second law (46/2013) is permanent in the Tuscan legal framework.  The national and international recognition of the Tuscan regional government in the law created a ""no return"" situation that allowed the institutionalization of the law 46/2013 in the region's legal order.  The second regional law (46/2013) reinforced the need for regional public debates on major infrastructure projects and in 2016 the first regional public debate (on the project to develop a new port of Livorno) was realized. Other regional public debates were to follow in the coming months and years, beginning with the 2017  public debate on the use of gypsum and waste management in the province of Gavorrano .III. The Tuscan case is a reference in the Italian and European context: towards replicability?The Tuscan experience served as an example and inspiration for the institutionalization of participation laws in other Italian regions (such as Emilia-Romagna, Sardinia and Umbria) as well as at the national level, as exemplified by the recent adoption of the necessity of public debates on major works at the national level in the new Italian code of public procurement (italian national laws no 11/2016 and 50/2016).  Tuscany has standardized (and applied) the instrument of public debate before the Italian Government, to show a more open and progressive vision as well as a time to find solutions to structural problems the country faces, such as the inability to carry out public works in the short term.  The  Region of Tuscany  institutionalized a database called ""Open Tuscany"" with the goal of creating a container of experiences, a database of studies and participatory cases. Open Tuscany is a public web space, free of charge, partially self managed within the rules of the Tuscany Region, headed by promoters of local participatory processes funded by Law 46/2013. The goal of Open Tuscany is to socialize the local experience and not to disperse information and expertise.IV. The TRPP has contributed to the development of a participatory culture in the Tuscan territorySome regional offices have used participatory tools to make their own choices and to draw policies; they promote  surveys  and deliberative moments with Tuscan citizens. For example, the regional Department for Transport has involved local public transport users to better understand the issues related to the use of the public service and its organization. In another instance, the Department of Personnel of the Tuscany Region proposed a participatory process with the employees' entity to discuss work issues and generate ideas to improve internal organization and the working climate.  The law increases participative culture in Tuscan civil society. This is demonstrated by the growing number of requests for support of the law not only by local authorities but also of other types of entities admitted: citizens, companies, and educational institutes.What are the TRPP's limitations and challenges?a) The TRPP is still highly vulnerable to political contexts.Despite the growing institutionalization of the law, the Tuscan participation system still is vulnerable to changes in government bodies and in the political framework. In recent times, the TRPP faced reduced political support by central organs of the regional administration. Recently, the TRPP suffered significant budget cuts and is working with limited financial resources and lack of staff. These characteristics are reducing their administrative capabilities in the promotion of participatory processes, especially at the local level.  The Tuscany Region does not support the regional offices of participation with a congruous staff (or number of employees) to be able to conduct real monitoring, follow the local projects, and to develop suitable promotion and communication of APP’s activities.  The APP’s decisions have been constrained by the limited resources, both in terms of available choices and in the evaluation criteria. For this reason, it has been impossible to replicate some innovative practices in different contexts because the Tuscan law admits only innovative projects. This critical element is further aggravated by the lack of a regional network (a kind of conference of mayors or the beneficiaries) for the sharing and exchange of experiences, problems and management models.  The APP is an administratively independent body. However, because its resources are externally controlled by other government agencies, such independence is relative in practical terms and its capacity for action is limited by the political context.  Despite undeniable progress of TRPP in promoting a participatory culture in the territory, the policy has a gap between its rhetorical use (with Tuscan official documents and speeches emphasizing participation as a regular form of government) and its implementation (insufficient capillarity and political support for participatory processes, linked with low integration of participation in the public policies and decision-making cycles).b) The results of the Tuscan case are limited due to the State fragmentation and because there is a low degree of integration among government agencies.Although several public bodies (at the regional and local levels) are involved in its management, the TRPP has not been successful in promoting participation as a regular form of government, since there is a lack of knowledge of the TRPP inside the government and little influence of the participation system in central public administration agencies in regional and local levels.  The Tuscany Region has not invested in personnel training of regional and local authorities to be able to promote local policies and participatory processes and to give programming autonomy and local management of participatory processes and continuity to the administration’s actions. This explains why the local governments are not autonomous in planning, implementation and management of participatory processes. They depend on the facilitation agencies that implement the actions for the promoters.  The Tuscan participation policy has not facilitated clear integration between the APP and the Guarantor for communication and participation for territorial policies anticipated by the territorial government law (Law 65/2014, which replaces the Law 1/2005). These organs have acted autonomously and on some occasions in a way not coordinated with each other.c) The TRPP still has several management problems, which are aggravated by limitations in the regional participation law.The bureaucratic organization of Tuscany Region’s administration makes management of the participatory processes complex. One of the most frequently encountered difficulties is the lack of coordination between local participatory processes and the accounting rules of the Region, especially for the projects developed of various annuity. Moreover, many promoters requested extensions of time for local projects (the law prescribes 6 months), which demonstrates that the execution times, in many cases, are incongruous.  The regional offices that support the participation law are two: one depends on the executive body (Giunta Regionale), the other on the Legislative body (Consiglio regionale); they are found in the different institutional centers and develop different tasks. This articulation produces difficulties in communication, management, and work organization.  The Law 46/2013 provides for a multiple guarantee organ, the Authority for participation, consisting of three members. The collective organization produced, in some cases, a lengthy decision-making process due to complex management of the APP. Also, the Tuscany Region’s scarce political investment again does not facilitate the resolution of management problems of APP. Finally the APP’s members do not have financial compensation to do their work.  The  first public debate – PD envisaged by the Regional Law on the new port of Livorno  was not an opportunity of observation for the Italian national Government and for the Tuscany regional government. The discussion was not followed by traditional media. The reasons can be traced back to two sets of issues: political and organizational. The political was the reduced political investment (on the law and on the PD instrument); the organizational ones are related on the management done by the PD staff, which is a consulting company that had to reconcile the Livorno’s work with their (own) activities so it could not devote the time and resources needed to this pioneer experience.See AlsoMini-Public on a Regional Law for Citizens’ Participation (Tuscany, Italy)Airport: Let's Talk About It (""Aeroporto Parliamone""), Tuscany, ItalyAmiata Grossetano: Sustainable Lifestyle :Collaborative Planning - Sbertoli Villas and the City (Pistoia, Italy)Ideas in the Square ""Idee In Piazza"" (Figline Valdarno, Italy)IntegrAzione (District of Florence)Io Conto “I Count”: Participatory Budgeting (Arezzo, Italy)Land Use Planning in Bounconvento - ""Variante al Piano Strutturale"" :  .Landscape Town Meeting (Tuscany)Participatory Budgeting ""Proposing Together, Deciding Together"" (Saione, Italy)Participatory Budgeting in San Marcello ""Facciamo i Conti...Insieme"" (Italy)Participatory Landscape Design ""Il Paesaggio Partecipato"" (Scansano, Italy)Participatory Planning in Carrara ""Porto le Mie Idee"" (Italy)Participatory Planning Workshop ""Cisternino 2020"" (Livorno, Italy)Participatory Renovation of Bovio Square (Piombino, Italy)Participatory Renovation of Ciompi Square (Florence, Italy)Participatory Socio-Economic Multi-year Plan “PartecipAppennino” (Tuscan-Emilian Appennine National Park, Italy)Planning Our Square Together ""Progettiamo Insieme la Nostra Piazza"" (Montale, Italy)Saione: a Neighborhood Where People MeetThe Alta Valle del Solano Community MapThe Wetland We Want ""Il Padule Che Vorremmo"" (Ponte Buggianese, Italy) :Together Down the Good Road (Forte dei Marmi, Italy)Uzzano - ""A School for All""Youth Participatory Budgeting in Colle di Val d'ElsaReferences  [1] Tuscany Regional Law on Participation No. 46/2013:  http://www.consiglio.regione.toscana.it/upload/AUTORIT%C3%80%20PARTECIPAZIONE/documenti/legge-2013-00046.pdf[2] Putnam, R.

 Traditional business management models use a hierarchy or 'ladder': people at the top make the most important decisions, while people at the bottom have the least responsibilities. The lattice structure of organization management was created in opposition to the traditional ladder model. Workers are largely self-directed and are included - to a greater or lesser extent - in major business decisions and project development. [1]  
 The word ‘lattice’ describes “a three-dimensional structure that extends infinitely in any direction…[and] are evident everywhere from a garden’s wooden trellis to the metalwork of the Eiffel tower.” [2]  Thus, it is an apt way to describe a method that produces no hierarchy, free information flow, and collective decision-making. 
 Origins and Development 
 The lattice model is largely attributed to Bill Gore, founder of  W.L. Gore &amp; Associates, Inc.  When establishing his company in the 1950s, Gore opted for a decentralized model to ensure every individual in the organization was connected to each other. He termed it a 'lattice' to emphasize the focus on interconnection. [3]Participant Recruitment and Selection 
 Lattice structures are generally kept small to build a close knit and interpersonal atmosphere. For example, at W.L. Gore and Associates, individual factories are prohibited from exceeding 200 employees. [4]  Here, hiring is a very selective process, with not all individuals able to handle the company’s distinct approach. [5]How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making 
 The lattice model was developed to increase connections between workers. In traditional organizations, these connections exist as an informal network of relationships underlying the formal hierarchy. In the lattice model, there are no (or, at least, fewer) layers of management, allowing information to flow freely in all directions and normalizing personal communication. Individuals and self-managed teams in the lattice are free to interact directly with anyone in the organization to get what they needed to be successful. [6]  Core to the lattice method is: 
 1) Direct person-to-person communication without intermediaries, enabling all employees to work with each other. This characteristic encourages more collaboration, something which has proven to be increasingly useful in today’s workplace environments in which non-routine, dispersed, virtual, and project-based work is common. [7]2) No fixed authority or boss. This characteristic is meant to encourage every member of a lattice organization use their own leadership skills in constantly changing teams. [8]  Here. “everyone can – and indeed, is expected to – contribute.” [9]3) Teams and the objectives that guide them are self-made. This characteristic allows lattice organizations to be more adaptive “as specific needs arise.”  [10]  
 According to Lisa Magloff at the Houston Chronicle, the lattice organization model consists of three ""lattice ways"": 
 1. Careers that can be organized to suit the needs of individual workers 
 2. Flexible work scheduling that allows workers to achieve a work-life balance by taking on more or less responsibility 
 3. Full participation – providing ways for workers to contribute ideas and suggestions in every area of the company. [11]W.L. Gore &amp; Associates Inc.  offers a case example of the lattice model in practice: while it has incorporated some structure as its grown and developed, the company largely retained an emphasis on worker connection, self-organization, and decentralized management. [12]Influence, Outcomes, and Effects 
 Although the lattice method takes time, it can lead to increased levels of commitment, morale and also bring together diverse perspectives and talents. W.L. Gore and Associates, for instance, has succeeded: the company is regularly ranked among the “best companies to work for” in the U.S.A. It is a leading global brand in breathable fabric membranes, and has diversified its product range largely thanks to employee-driven innovations, with successful products in areas including musical equipment (guitar strings), dental hygiene (floss), and medical equipment. Since the company’s creation and its usage of the lattice method, it has always made a profit. [13]  
 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 Contrary to some critiques, the lattice method responds well to crisis as “a lot of useless effort is avoided because there is no rigid management hierarchy to conquer before you can attack a problem.” [14]Both the founders themselves and management scholarship have argued that the lattice method would not necessarily work for all firms, and may be easier to implement in start-ups than already established hierarchical firms. [15]  An organization’s values and culture are core to the model, which takes a long-term approach rather than one which is focused on maximizing short-term efficiency; without this foundation, the method would be hard to emulate. Finally, the uniqueness of this method means that not all workers thrive under it, as shown through the rigorous recruitment strategy employed by W.L. Gore and Associates. Thus, in some ways this participatory method is exclusionary. [16]With that being said, the lattice method has also led to a re-imagination of the ‘ideal’ workplace structure. Writing for Deloitte Insights, Cathy Benko, Molly Anderson, and Suzanne Vickberg question the old hierarchical ladder method of structuring organizations, observing that it “defines career success as a linear climb to the top. Ultimately, the ladder’s one-size-fits-all approach assumes employees are more alike than different, and want and need similar things to deliver results.” [17]  The fact that this statement comes from an influential company such as Deloitte may lead other organizations to examine the applicability of the lattice method to their own workplace in the future.

You can help Participedia by adding to it.Problems and Purpose  Participatory Guarantee Systems (PGS) were developed as an alternative to third-party certification, promising to guarantee the regulatory compliance of organic produce based on the participation of producers and other stakeholders, and are built on participation, trust, social networks and knowledge exchange. [1]Origins and Development  Organic agriculture has emerged as a competitive sector in many countries in recent decades, bringing with it a host of regulations, support programs, and subsidies. Control and certification systems for organic production and imports often rely on third-party certification (TPC) to ensure the conformity or compliance of organic agriculture (and its products) within the regulatory framework. [2]   Participatory Guarantee Systems (PGS) were introduced in the early 2000s [3]  in response to criticism of TPC for being expensive for producers, causing consumers to pay more for products, not being adapted to local circumstances, being hard for small producers to achieve, making agriculture more bureaucratic, simplifying production processes, and for not always being clear about the procedures the TPC bodies are implementing. [4]Participant Recruitment and Selection  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The term Participatory Guarantee System was first presented and analyzed during a 2004 workshop run by the Latin American Organic Agriculture Movement (MAELA), International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) and the Centro Ecológico in Torres, Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil). [5]PGS were defined by the group as “quality assurance initiatives that are locally relevant, emphasize the participation of stakeholders, including producers and consumers, and operate outside the frame of TPC.” [6]  The basic elements of PGS, according to IFOAM, are participation, a shared vision, transparency, trust, being a learning process, and horizontality. [7]PGS are expected to be culturally appropriate, require less paperwork than TPC, and are linked to local and alternative commercialization channels: those based on the reconnection and close communication between producer and consumer, building new forms of relationships and governance of the network of actors. [8]   PGS involves the farmers and consumers in the process of developing and administering the certification. With PGS, the farmer’s signed agreement is publicly disclosed to ensure a greater level of public involvement, farmer commitment, and overall transparency. [9]With its emphasis on knowledge building for the farmer, PGS appear to help producers improve production, achieve political independence, boost livelihoods and establish social networks, and are thought to be appropriate for small producers due to their participatory and horizontal structure allowing a more suitable and less costly system of certification. [10]   A PGS initiative should reflect a community’s capacity to prove trust through the implementation of diverse social and cultural control instruments in order to provide information to guarantee the integrity of their organic producers. [11]Since their creation, Participatory Guarantee Systems have been adopted around the world. Many regions in East Africa have adopted the practice, such as  Towelo Village in Eastern Tanzania .

5644,method,Solutions Journalism,https://participedia.net/method/5644,Solutions journalism casts a spotlight on the ways that people respond to conflict. It is a way for journalists and journalism to paint a more complete picture of the world.,0,2019-03-05,2019-06-30,417805,"""Kam Razavi""",https://participedia.net/user/417805,110904,"""Scott Fletcher Bowlsby""",https://participedia.net/user/110904,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not_applicable,,,,,,,," Problems and Purpose  Solutions journalism is rigorous reporting on ways that people respond to social problems. [1]  It is a response to conventional journalism, which mostly emphasizes conflict-oriented frames, or what journalism scholars Karen McIntyre and Cathrine Gyldensted call the “disease model of the world.” Solutions journalism reports not only on what is wrong, but also how people are responding to make things right. It looks at the news through a “well-being model of the world.” [2]  It draws on evidence of what is working – or, conversely, how a solution may be faltering. It eschews hypotheticals and intentions, focusing instead on effectiveness. [3]   Origins and Development  Solutions journalism builds on earlier approaches to journalism that tried to better integrate participatory techniques into conventional news reporting. [4]  Two of the more prominent of these earlier approaches are  peace journalism  and  public journalism .  Peace journalism, which traces its roots to the 1960s and 1970s, challenges the traditional journalistic approach to conflict as a two-sided struggle. Peace journalism encourages reporters to reach out to people looking for non-violent solutions to conflict, and it encourages journalists to examine underlying causes conflict. Because it reports on ways to resolve conflict, peace journalism has been criticized by traditionalists for straying into advocacy. Peace journalism has also been criticized for its lack of practical use. [5]In the 1990s, proponents of another alternative journalistic movement -- public journalism (also known as civic journalism) -- argued that journalists not only played a role informing the public, but that journalism was also crucial for engaging people on matters of public importance. [6]  Through public journalism, journalists could work collaboratively with members of the community to create a collective baseline for solving problems. [7]New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen was one of the pioneers of the public journalism movement. He says that public journalism can:  “1) address people as citizens, potential participants in public affairs, rather than victims or spectators; 2) help the political community act upon, rather than simply learn about, its problems; 3) improve the climate of public discussion, rather than simply watching it deteriorate; 4) make public life go well, so that it earns its claim on our attention.” [8]Public journalism, in particular, envisioned what journalism scholar Peter Bro has called an “active” role for journalists. Bro quotes Thomas E. Patterson, who offers this explanation of “active” and “passive” journalism:  “...[the] passive journalist is one who acts as the instrument of actors outside the news system, such as government officials, party leaders, and interest group advocates … In contrast, the active journalist is one who is more fully a participant in his or her own right, actively shaping, interpreting, or investigating political subjects.” [9]The idea that journalists should separate their personal values from the facts is a central theme of American and Anglo-Saxon (including Canadian) journalistic tradition. It is associated with the role of journalism as a watchdog or monitor over government power or social events [10] , and, broadly, with the idea of journalistic objectivity.  But this ‘traditional’ view is not the only interpretation of journalism’s role in a democratic society. According to Christians et al., journalism plays three other roles in a democracy. One of those is the facilitative role – journalism as a mechanism for facilitating informed debate. [11]  The public journalism movement was more closely aligned with journalism’s facilitative function. But because public journalism confronted conventional approaches, it faced considerable criticism and ultimately failed to find widespread uptake  [12] .  Participant Recruitment and SelectionKnow how participants are recruited for this method? Help us complete this section!   How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision Making  Solutions journalism is a form of alternative journalism. It makes use of an expanded range of news frames to draw a more complete picture of the world. Frames are “thematic categories that integrate and give meaning to the scene, the characters, their actions and supporting documentation”. [13]  Journalism scholar Robert M. Entman has defined four frames in communication studies. Entman says frames can be used to identify a problem; describe its causes; offer moral evaluations of the problem; and produce remedies for dealing with the problem. [14]Most news stories focus on conflict-oriented frames [15] . Solutions journalism makes remedies a central part of the story’s arc [16] , as opposed to just an afterthought at the end of the article, or in the back half of the news program.  In 1998, Susan Benesch wrote in the  Columbia Journalism Review  that solutions journalism “differs from other good journalism in one simple way: instead of pointing out what’s wrong in the hope that someone will fix it, solutions journalism points out what’s right, hoping that someone can imitate it”. [17]Some may perceive solutions journalism as ‘good news stories.’ The  Solutions Journalism Network  guards against the idea of solutions journalism as ‘positive news.’ The group lists several solutions journalism “imposters” [18]  on its website.  Solutions journalism is hard news reporting on how people respond to social problems. The story pertains to a given conflict (a war, economic downturn, climate change, etc.) – it is still  news  after all. But, solutions journalism is a way of changing the kind of knowledge journalists create  through  their work – by identifying and reporting on ways out of problems as opposed to reporting only on the problems themselves. David Bornstein, a co-founder of the  Solutions Journalism Network  puts it this way:  “The feedback system known as journalism is based on the idea that the way to improve society is to show people where we’re going wrong. It’s like pointing out your children’s mistakes every morning and expecting that this will make them into better people. Children need examples. They need to know that different behavior is possible and wins notice. Society needs the same thing. Misdeeds often persist because people are ignorant of ways to address them more successfully.” [19]   Solutions journalists and solution-oriented news organizations are hard at work producing more of this kind of journalism.  The Tyee  is a Vancouver-based online news outlet that puts solutions at the heart of the stories it tells. It was a pioneer of solutions reporting in North America. [20]  In the US, the  Solutions Journalism Network  has partnered with 154 news organizations and 17 journalism schools to support solution-oriented storytelling. [21]  In France, the organization  Reporters d’Espoir  (Reporters With Hope) has been supporting rigorous solution-oriented reporting since 2004. [22]  Its mission statement talks about piercing through fear and inaction to create a sense of engagement on social, economic and environmental issues.  In sum, solutions journalism encourages a different type of news reporting. It does this by punching past conflict-oriented frames in news discourse to include solution-oriented ones in that discourse as well. [23]   Solutions journalism and ‘positive psychology’  Solution-oriented reporting applies techniques from “positive psychology” to challenge the discourse of negativity in the news (Karen McIntyre and Catherine Gyldensted use the umbrella term “constructive journalism” to describe journalism that draws on tenets of ‘positive’ psychology). [24]  Positive psychology techniques involve finding ways to help readers make positive associations with news events, instead of making only negative connections.  Negativity and fear are powerful agents for capturing people’s attention. As psychologist Barbara Fredrickson has written, “[i]n a life-threatening situation, a narrowed thought-action repertoire promotes quick and decisive action that carries direct and immediate benefit”. [25]  However, such negative thought-action responses also narrow the scope of people’s cognitive processes and abilities, resulting in “narrowed mindsets.” [26]  “Narrowed mindsets,” in turn, make it more likely for people to “miss the forest for the trees.” [27]   There are several ways to use ‘positive psychology’ to report the news. In “Positive psychology as a theoretical foundation for constructive journalism,” journalism scholars Karen McIntyre and Cathrine Gyldensted talk about six specific strategies, including “constructive interviewing” to draw out solutions to seemingly intractable conflicts [28] .  One technique involves constructive interviewing. Instead of asking only linear questions (who, what, where, when and why), solution-oriented journalists can ask questions that draw on their sources’ reasons for thinking the way they do: “How did this affect you?” or “What is your explanation for A or B?”. [29]   Alternately, solution-oriented journalists can gently steer their interview subjects toward different ways of thinking about an issue. For example, journalists might ask a source how he or she might deal with a certain problem, or they might ask interviewees try to think about an issue from the perspectives of those they might not agree with (“what do you think the other side wants?”). [30]Solutions Journalism in Practice:  The TyeeIn Vancouver,  The Tyee , an independent digital news platform, sees solutions reporting as part of its mission of producing rigorous journalism. [31]  An affiliated organization called the  Tyee Solutions Society  has produced solution-oriented reports on issues ranging from housing to energy. On its website, the  Tyee Solutions Society  says it “produces solutions-oriented reporting that uses traditional investigative techniques to empower citizens with the information needed to seize opportunities for positive change”. [32] The Tyee ’s founder, publisher and editor is David Beers. In an interview with Simon Fraser University Associate Professor Shane Gunster, Beers discusses how the emphasis of too much reporting has long been on all that is wrong. He says that in most commercial news organizations there was “this weird situation in newsrooms, where you had all these journalists that were trained in the ethos of investigation and finding things out for the common good, but their only mandate was to find out what was just going to hell, what sucked”. [33]Beers then discusses three specific ways that journalists can produce positive change. First, he argues that journalists can showcase examples of people who are actually working to make a positive difference (or who have had success doing so). Second, he says journalists can play a role to publicize small-scale examples of projects or innovations that have the potential for transformative change (or that are already making a difference). Third, he underscores the importance of discussing how solutions have been sought and implemented in other jurisdictions. [34]   Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  There is some scholarship on the effect that solutions journalism has on audiences, but more work needs to be done to properly assess its impact. In “Solutions Journalism,” Karen McIntyre describes a survey experiment she carried out that tested audience effects of the approach. She concludes that news audiences who read solutions stories feel a greater sense of optimism about the issue and a greater sense of self-efficacy as well. However, the solutions stories did not result in any change in the degree to which those same readers intended to act. The solutions stories did not change actual behaviours either. [35]Other experiments examined the effect of solutions journalism at the community level. In “Engaging stigmatized communities through solutions journalism: Residents of South Los Angeles respond,” authors Wenzel et al., used focus groups to test the impact of solution-oriented journalism in a community that has long faced racial discrimination. The researchers found that the groups that read the solutions stories felt more likely that they could make a difference. However, they still believed that the solutions approach was not enough to counter stigmatization and discrimination. [36]Analysis and Lessons Learned  Despite the rise in popularity and interest in solutions journalism, there are contesting views about the approach. A clear conceptual definition of the concept is lacking. [37]  There is also a debate over solutions journalism’s relationship with advocacy. [38]  Because journalism is so often associated with its role as a detached monitor of government power and social events, the idea of journalism-as-advocacy is deeply frowned upon by journalists. [39]  To get around the idea that solutions journalism advocates for solutions, the  Solutions Journalism Network , for instance, insists that solutions reporting focus on what has worked – as opposed to what could or should work. [40]   Other interpretations of solutions journalism take a slightly different view. In “The constructive role of journalism,” journalism scholars Tanja Aitamurto and Anita Varma analyze how constructive journalism contests the traditional monitorial role of journalism. Aitamurto and Varma propose a fifth normative category for journalism to go alongside Christian et al.’s four others: “We argue that constructive journalism is not just a genre of news but also constitutes a distinctive normative role for the press that should be added to the widely accepted normative roles of a monitorial, facilitative, radical and collaborative press in Christians et al.” [41]   Aitamurto and Varma propose a more active role for journalism, in contrast to the traditional passive role [42] . They describe this fifth normative role as a way for journalists to offer “a vision of how society could move forward”. [43]  McIntyre and Gyldensted also discuss prospective solutions in their “Positive psychology” paper. The researchers argue that “future orientation” is an effective technique for identifying and defining solutions. In addition to the 5W’s outlined above, journalists can ask their sources (and themselves) a “what now?” question. Such an approach can generate new ideas for thinking about, and better yet, solving a conflict – without turning to direct advocacy. [44]Whether solutions journalism should constitute an entirely new ‘role’ for journalism, or whether it is simply an add-on to ‘existing’ practice is a point of debate. What is clear, however, is that the approach tries to paint a fuller picture, through journalism that examines solutions alongside conflict. There is evidence that bad news produces cynicism and “news fatigue” [45] . Solution journalism tries to address cynicism, polarization and political apathy by opening up positive ‘pathways’ in news reporting. It is a tool for informing critical journalism through a more complete approach to the news.

Please help us complete it.Problems and Purpose  Local exchange trading systems (LETS) are alternative marketplaces which allowing for the exchange of goods and services using a locally created currency. LETS were developed as a way to allow trading between those who are not able to acess or participate in traditional economic structures.[1]  Origins and Development  Participant Recruitment and Selection  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  LETS members are issued a chequebook and trade using a unique currency, the value of which is set by System members. Transactions are digitally recorded, allowing individuals or member organisations built up credits or debits. Credits can be 'cashed' with other members within the system and debits redeemed by providing goods or services. All market activity is subject to the agreement of both parties of a transaction.[2]  Local Exchange Trading Systems contain the follow four elements:Tools to allow participants to make their offers and wants known to others in the marketplace  Search mechanisms for buyers to connect with sellers; for people to find what others are offering, and to offer goods and services in return  Secure and reliable ways for people to transfer units of the LETS currency amongst others in the network  A reliable, centralized method of recording transactions.[3]The following is an illustration of LETS in practice and comes from the Bradford LETS, established by Tariq Shabeer in the mid-1990s:  Each member was issued with a LETS chequebook and traded with other members in BRADS and FORDS. The value of the BRAD was set at £1, the FORD, being a hundredth part of a BRAD, was worth 1p. Transactions were recorded in the computerised Directory at the Bradford LETS office and individuals or member organisations built up credits or debits. They could 'cash' their credits with anyone within the system (subject of course to the agreement of the person concerned) and likewise could redeem their debits by providing goods or services to anyone within it. He had recently bought a pair of glasses from John Robinson worth £100, which he paid for with £50 sterling and 50 BRADS. When this transaction reached the computer John’s account would go up by 50 BRADS, and Tariq’s would go down by the same amount. He could pay this back by, for instance, giving lifts to a number of other people until the debit was redeemed. Similarly John could spend his credits elsewhere, perhaps by getting LETS members to distribute leaflets on housing estates about his business or for his campaigns as a Green Party candidate. The charge for joining the Bradford LETS was minimal: £5 for those in work, £2 for the unemployed. This was to cover running costs - producing the Directory, postage and so forth.[4]  LETS have been established all over the world. One example is the Puma Local Exchange Trading Scheme which has been used in the marginalized Pumarejo neighbourhood of Seville since 2012 as a way to reduce vulnerability and exclusion resulting from the economic crisis of 2008.[5]  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Analysis and Lessons Learned  See AlsoThe Puma Local Exchange Trading Scheme Alternative Currency (Pumarejo, Spain)    References  [1] Dil Green, “LETS Marketplace from a Feature ‘Phone,”  Digital Anthropology  (Digital Anthropology, April 24, 2017), https://digital-anthropology.me/2017/04/24/lets-marketplace-from-a-feature-phone/#more-1431.

5648,method,Farmers Advocacy Consultation Tool (FACT),https://participedia.net/method/5648,"A collaborative approach to the development of organizational policies and position papers through consultation with members, stakeholders, and experts. ",0,2019-03-14,2019-03-14,110904,"""Scott Fletcher Bowlsby""",https://participedia.net/user/110904,110904,"""Scott Fletcher Bowlsby""",https://participedia.net/user/110904,en,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,general_agreement/consensus,,,,,,,," Problems and Purpose 
 The Farmers Advocacy Consultation Tool (FACT) combines the knowledge of farmers and farmer organizations together with expert advice to generate policies and position statements that are accountable, evidence-based, relevant to current issues, and technically-feasible. Through dialogue between farmers’ organizations, their constituents, and policy experts, FACT ensures all policy positions or statements respond to and reflect the reality of members’ needs. [1]  
 Origins and Development 
 FACT was developed by Agriterra, a Dutch advocacy and consultancy group working with farmers and farmers organizations around the world. [2]  It is unclear when the FACT technique was developed, but it has been used in Bolivia by the Empowering Smallholder Farmers in Markets (ESFIM) program, [3]  in Uganda by the Uganda National Farmers Federation, [4]  in Vietnam by the Viet Nam Farmer’s Union, [5]  and in various parts of Africa. [6]How it Works 
 The FACT approach contains four components: consultations, participatory research, writing SMART proposals, and stakeholder mapping and analysis for lobby and advocacy. Workshops using the FACT approach are guided by a reader, containing the basics of the process, two facilitators guides, and two participants workbooks (1 + 2). [7]  
 According to the tool’s developers, Agrittera, “while the success of any proposal is never guaranteed, the FACT approach certainly increases the possibility of success. Members' information is obtained through a systematic consultation process that enables the farmers not only to 'know' what the relevant issues and information are, but also to 'show that it knows'. This means that any position paper or proposal based on the FACT method remains accountable to those that it represents and is credible for decision makers. If members feel that their organisation is genuinely concerned about consulting them, their feeling of 'ownership' of the position papers and proposals is enhanced.” [8]Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 In a report for the  Capitalization of Experience for Greater Impact in Rural Development  program, Prudence Ayebare of the Uganda National Farmers’ Federation (UNFF) reflects on their use of the FACT tool: “UNFFE was not sure if district local government officials would support this [young farmers] initiative [but n]ow we see that the FACT approach can be used effectively to lobby government and other stakeholders for service provision. There is power in number, especially when engaging in advocacy-related issues. It was a great experience to interact with evidence-based research and use it to engage policy makers.” [9]

 Community-owned enterprises are run by those they directly benefit: the community. The COE model increases community participation and empowerment in local planning and development. COEs take various forms such as cooperatives, credit unions, land trusts, and limited stock ownership enterprises. [1]COEs – especially in the energy and resource sector – are typically established to: Create a stable revenue source for the community 
 Build community leadership, governance, entrepreneurism and expertise

 Peredo and Chrisman described community-based enterprises (CBEs) as emerging from “a process in which  the community  acts entrepreneurially to create and operate a new enterprise embedded in its existing social structure.” [3]  CBEs emerge when a community works collaboratively to “create or identify a market opportunity and organize themselves in order to respond to it.” [4]  These ventures “are managed and governed to pursue the economic and social goals of a community in a manner that is meant to yield sustainable individual and group benefits over the short and long term.” [5]  CBEs are positioned in a sector of the economy that is not dominated by a profit motive, often because there is little profit to be made, or by government. Some scholars refer to CBEs as being owned by the community while others indicate they can be owned by individuals or groups of people on behalf of the communities they serve. [6]A successful example of community-owned enterprises can be found  in Indonesia  where rural villagers own and maintain electrical mini-grids. 
 Influence, Outcomes, and Effects 
 Community-owned enterprises are intrinsically social enterprises. While they have to make surpluses to sustain themselves, social needs, for example to serve the constituencies that gave rise to them (e.g., creating local employment or responding to some cultural need), are paramount. [7]Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 According to Henry Mintzberg of the Canadian Community Economic Development Network, community enterprises average longer lives than privately-owned businesses. While businesses are usually started by individual entrepreneurs for personal gain, social enterprises usually arise in response to collective needs, often in identifiable communities. Because of a resulting “collective heritage”, they have a greater potential to offer a more sustainable model of economic development.

 The on-line Community Planning Toolkit is primarily directed toward voluntary sectors but it is also useful for a range of partners participating in Community Planning including, local authorities and private sector interests. 
 The toolkit has been designed as a learning resource for all who are interested in participating in community planning - particularly the Community and Voluntary Sectors. The toolkit helps plan and evaluate engagement events; develop and monitor an outcomes based approach; and build and strengthen partnership working and achieve greater alignment. It was developed by the Scottish NGO Community places to help practitioners positively influence and enhance future community planning legislation, guidance and practice. 
 Origins and Development 
 The Community Planning Toolkit was developed by  Community Places  through the support of the BIG Lottery Fund to help the Community and Voluntary Sector in Northern Ireland to prepare for the planned introduction of council-led Community Planning in 2015. 
 In February 2010 the Big Lottery Fund issued an invitation to tender for three Community Planning Pilot Projects and a Learning, Support and Toolkit contract. Its decision to do so was: in response to the planned introduction of Community Planning; 
 in recognition that the community and voluntary sectors (CVS) are under-resourced to participate in Community Planning on an equal footing; 
 designed to support the CVS to fully engage in Community Planning.How it Works 
 The Toolkit explores five key themes which are essential for effective Community Planning Practice: Community Planning, Engagement, Working Together, Outcomes and Achieving Alignment. Each theme highlights and signposts the user to useful tools, resources and podcasts. Each of the themes are interrelated and cross referenced throughout the toolkit.

5754,method,Kenyan Farmer Groups,https://participedia.net/method/5754,"Farmer groups were developed by the Kenyan Government to share new technologies with farmers, to establish common goals and agricultural strategies, and to encourage interaction and sharing of knowledge, resources, and experiences.",0,2019-04-20,2019-04-20,110904,"""Scott Fletcher Bowlsby""",https://participedia.net/user/110904,110904,"""Scott Fletcher Bowlsby""",https://participedia.net/user/110904,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"  Note: the following entry is missing citations. Please help us verify its content.Problems and Purpose 
 Farmer Groups were adopted by the current Kenyan Government to maximize the efficiency of its agricultural production by spreading newly developed technologies to farmers as well as setting up common goals and developing new strategies. In recent years, private sectors, NGOs and NPOs have been increasing their involvement in the Farmer-Group Approach. Maximizing the agricultural outputs is very important in Kenya because the economy, its development and the GDP of Kenya heavily rely on its agricultural outputs. As a part of the agricultural extension services, the Government created the National Agricultural Extension Policy (NASEP). The Governmental branch since the late 1990’s has encouraged farmers to interact with each other while sharing knowledge, resources and experiences by using the Farmer-Group approach. An ideal farmer group would maintain the number of its members between twenty and thirty. Farmer groups have no facilitators or specific structure of how these meetings are supposed to be run. While not explicitly deliberative, the groups give participant-farmers more freedoms to speak out and share their knowledge, resources, and experiences. 
 Origins and Development 
 Independence from the Great Britain left then the newly born Kenya unable to function in many aspects including governance, politics, sociology, and more. Its economy was not an exception. The most apparent negative consequence of the British colonization was that the Economy of Kenya was left one dimensional. The agricultural production was practically the only thing Kenya could offer economically in the 1960’s. The lack of other economic means forced the Kenyan Government to rely on its agricultural outputs and as a method to maximize the outputs by incorporating newly developed technologies, they used baraza (in literal translation baraza means village gathering) to mobilize these agricultural communities. The main problem of these barazas was the fact that it was a complete top-down method. Baraza can trace its roots back to traditional tribal meetings in which tribal leaders would talk and common villagers (just men, women were often excluded) would just listen and follow whatever they were told. Now in these modern village gatherings called barazas, these old traditions continued. According to the observation notes provided by Dr. Catherine Wawasi Kitetu, on the average baraza lasted two to four hours and within these two to four hours, activities of extension officers who were like those tribal leaders consisted of talking, lecturing, describing and explaining while activities of farmers who could be seen as common villagers were listening and thanking. 
 Such a traditional top-down approach of community mobilizing did not meet the expectations previously set by the Kenyan Authorities. In next couple of decades, the Government would try other approaches to maximize the agricultural outputs by spreading new technologies and newly developed and improved agricultural methods. 
 Other problems also occurred as time went on. One of the more significant problems was the exclusion of female farmers in these baraza gatherings. Data has shown that the 75% of labour in the Kenyan agriculture was done by women and according to the report provided by Dr. Kitetu, only a handful of female farmers were observed by her at baraza. 
 Farmers groups were developed as a replacement to the Baraza system and other top-down methods.  Farmers groups encouraged horizontal methods which encouraged individual farmers to come together to talk about problems and reach consensus, conclusions and solutions. Farmer groups are used to provide farmers in all of Kenya with updated technologies, information and methods. Extension officers are often present at these meetings to take notes of these meetings. These notes are presented to the government officials so that they could take these opinions in consideration when making policies. 
 Participant Recruitment and Selection 
 Participation is completely voluntary for farmer groups. While these group meetings are generally seen as beneficial, farmers have and do practice their rights whether to participate or not. Some farmer groups have set bars of membership requirements so that not all farmers could join the group. 
 How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making 
 Unlike the structure of baraza, the basic structure of farmer groups was made possible for participants to see each other as equals. For example, at barazas extensions officers were seated at a table placed on a higher ground so that they were looking down on villagers. It was seen as sign of their superiority. These officers were only ones speaking at these gatherings and all others were there to just listen and observe. At farmer group meetings, however, all tables are placed on the same level of ground and everyone is free to voice their opinions. Although extension officers are often present at these gatherings, officers are not there to dominate the meetings but to contribute and provide information before the meeting. They also take notes for future policy making. 
 In these meetings which usually last about thirty minutes to an hour, there are three big phases. In the opening phase, house keeping things are informed. In the key part of these meetings, the second phase of farmer group meetings, extension officials share technologies and individual farmers share knowledge and experiences to make things better for all who serve in the agricultural industry. It is not uncommon to have group “leaders” present at these meetings, but their title does not give them any extra power as their extra duty is not to facilitate but just to make sure things do not get out of hand. Group meetings are run freely and without a specific structure. In the third and the final phase of the group meetings, they review what they have talked about so far in the meeting and adjure. 
 The most important difference between baraza and farmer group approaches is the roles of participants. Extension officers’ primary duties at baraza were to provide all the information or simply put, to talk while duties of the same people at farmer group meetings are to listen and take notes with occasional presentation of updated technologies and methods. Farmers’ primary duties at baraza were to listen. However, at group meetings, they were the main participants who share, question and talk about problems and development of agriculture in Kenya. 
 Influence, Outcomes, and Effects 
 Farmer groups, though much improved from baraza, are not perfect to say the least. But there have been a number of positive reports about the Farmer Group Approach. The Kyeko Self Help Farmer Group has reportedly helped a significant number of women which saw a dramatic increase in their outputs in just one year; from $2,000 in 2001 to $14,000 in 2002 or from 1,985kg in 2001 to 19,800kg of outputs in 2002. Although the case of the Kyeko Self Help Farmer Group is a very successful case which stands out among others, the general consensus is that the Farmer-Group approach has improved the overall quality of the agricultural industry in Kenya but there is a lot of room for it to grow. 
 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 The lack of detailed structure of these meetings have given participants unlimited freedom to voice their opinions. But it also has caused problems of inefficiencies. There have been records of participants getting off the topic during meetings. Scholars have warned about the lack of structure and what it would mean in a long run for the extension program. 
 The allocation of the financial resources has also caused a significant amount of problems against the development and frequent usage of the method. In the early 2000's, the Kenyan Government has made a tremendous decrease in funds for these approach. Since private sectors have taken up the role of providing resources for these farmer groups. But since these funds come in as investments for these farmers, less profitable areas and rural areas have not gotten the same about of attention or resources. NGOs and local NPOs have tried to provided for these less profitable districts in Kenya but their resources are also limited.

However, determining whether a policy is well implemented and is meeting its desired objectives presents an opportunity for public engagement. Social auditing is the practice of citizen-led efforts to define measures of impact, monitor policy or project implementation, and gather evidence on service delivery. By leveraging the public to undertake policy evaluation, social auditing has the potential to improve existing service delivery and guide future policy formulation.[1] Social auditing is typically used by civil society or non-governmental organizations to evaluate the external and internal performance of their programs and services and to monitor government corruption at the grassroots level.[2]  Origins and Development  The term ‘social auditing’ has been in use since the 1950s, but the practice has only recently seen as increase in popularity, especially within developing nations.[3] In recent years, new technology has facilitated the use of social auditing by enabling policy makers to  crowdsource  citizen feedback on a larger-scale and in real-time.[4]  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Participants in the social audit are members of the public. The point of performing a social audit is to go to the population base and find out what people need and what they’re getting.[5] The scope of participation can vary based on the organizing entity and their objectives. One audit may involve asking students to collect data about their local school environments, while another may enlist the help of every citizen in monitoring the progress of local development projects.[6]  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Social auditing is typically led by a governmental or non-governmental body and involves enlisting members of the public in the measurement and performance of policies and programs.[7] According to Neil Andersson at the Autonomous University of Gerrero, the process can be broken into two phases:Phase 1: design and data collectionclarify the strategic focus  analyse existing data to identify gaps and generate operational questions  define population sample, design instruments, and conduct pilot test  collect information from households, institutions, and key informants in a panel of representative communities  link public service and household data, analyse in a way that points to actionPhase 2: socialising evidence for participatory actiontake findings back to the communities for their views about how to improve the situation  summarise information for policy and management (e.g. score cards)  evidence-based training of planners, service-providers and media  partnerships with civil society[8]Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  By enlisting the help of the public in auditing of policies and programs, organizations get valuable, on-the-ground feedback from end users. The process itself can help build public trust by facilitating accountability and transparency, while the results enable policy makers and project managers to monitor and improve their performance.[9]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Yale University’s CrowdLaw offers the following advice to ensure social auditing is successful:Tie the audit to measurable outcomes, such as increasing the number of problems fixed in schools or derelict land use sites to be cleaned up  Make sure audit participants understand what is being asked of them  Have an institutional actor ready and willing to respond to the results, otherwise the efforts of the social auditing community will not lead to outcomes[10]See AlsoCrowdsourcingThe Black Sash Model of Community Based Monitoring (CBM)Election MonitoringReferences  [1] “Study Group: Putting the Public Back in Government Session 3,” Harvard Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, accessed April 30, 2019,  https://ash.harvard.edu/event/study-group-putting-public-back-government-session-3 .

5768,method,Evolutionary Stakeholder Discovery,https://participedia.net/method/5768,Evolutionary Stakeholder Discovery is a recruitment technique using multiple waves of invitation and creating optimal criteria that the participating stakeholders may represent. ,0,2019-05-02,2019-05-02,110904,"""Scott Fletcher Bowlsby""",https://participedia.net/user/110904,110904,"""Scott Fletcher Bowlsby""",https://participedia.net/user/110904,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Problems and Purpose 
 Evolutionary Stakeholder Discovery is a recruitment technique developed by Dialogic Design to ensure the selection sample is fair, inclusive, and reflects a community's contributions and perspectives. [1] 
 Origins and Development 
 Evolutionary Stakeholder Discovery was developed by Peter Jones of the innovation research firm Redesign Network.[2] Peter used the method in 2012 to recruit participants to a design lab organized by Toronto's Strategic Innovation Lab as part of a multi-stakeholder panel for the SSHRC Imagining Canada's Future initiative.[1] 
 How it Works 
 The process of Evolutionary Stakeholder Discovery reveals stakeholders several “waves” of invitations sent in batches to stakeholders that meet certain subsets and intersections of pre-determined criteria. Each batch captures an inclusive set of categories, and are continually sent until all gaps in the criteria are filled.  The sampling is often attuned for knowledge and power/influence depending on the political or organizational contexts. Political perspective/leaning may also be considered. The process generally takes 3-weeks.[1] 
 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 While the process is labour intensive and time-consuming, those who use it stand by its results.[3] According to its developer, Peter Jones, the technique is notable for its flexibility: ""the Evolutionary approach, consistent with Third-Phase (or post-normal) Science, ensures that the evolutionary discovery returns the products of our learning to the context of the dialogue itself. We can see this as a classical wicked problem dynamic, where the problem frame shifts a bit as we discover the stakeholders interested in the initial framing. Working with a core group [...] we continually reviewed the stakeholder selections and triggering question, adjusting the question as we understood the variety of interests identified with participants.""[1]

The method is designed to accommodate as many as 100 people in one room or hundreds of people in parallel rooms. Future Search uses mutual learning as a catalyst for voluntary action and follow-up.  The method is based on the following principles:""Get the “whole system” in the room. Invite a significant cross-section of all parties with a stake in the outcome – those with authority, resources, expertise, information and need.  Explore the “whole elephant” before seeking to fix any part. Get everyone talking about the same world. Think globally, act locally.  Put common ground and future focus front and center while treating problems and conflicts as information, not action items.  Encourage self-management and responsibility for action by participants before, during and after the Future Search.""[1]Origins and Development  The Future Search meeting method was designed over 50 years by practitioners Sandra Janoff and Marv Weisbord.[2] It is informed by many theories and principles tested in a broad range of cultures. Future Searches have been run in every sector of society all over the world.[1]  Participant Recruitment and Selection  A cross-selection of relevant stakeholders – those with authority, resources, expertise, information and needs particular to the issue – are invited to take part.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Future Searches generally run for 20 hours across five 1/2 day sessions.Day 1: AfternoonFocus on the Past: participants create time lines to illustrate key events in the world, their own lives, and in the topic under consideration at the meeting. Participants are then convened in small groups to share their time line and discuss its implications on their work.  Focus on Present, External Trends: Participants are convened as a whole group to create a “mind map” of trends affecting them now and to identify the key trends for their topic.Day 2: MorningFocus on Present, External Trends:  stakeholder groups  describe their current activities and future plans/goals.  Focus on Present: stakeholder groups report their successes and regrets in dealing with the Future Search topic.Day 2: AfternoonIdeal Future Scenarios: participants are split into diverse groups and asked to imagine themselves in the future and to describe what it would optimally be and look like.  Identify Common Ground: each group records the themes they reached a  consensus  on.Day 3: Morning &amp; Early AfternoonConfirm Common Ground: participations are convened as a whole group to discuss and come to agreement on the themes of common ground. Common Ground Statements are written by volunteers to reflect the will of those present.  Action Planning: volunteers sign up to implement action plans.[3]  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Future Search meetings are designed to move beyond planning and into action. Action plans devised during the meetings are put into work immediately following the conference. Planners are encouraged to build connections during the event and to obtain commitments to and support for the actions resulting from the process. According to its developers, the best time to act on an action plan is right after the meeting, and to do so quickly and efficiently. The longer the implementation process, the less effective it will be. The designers suggest each action group convenes small versions of the Future Search to keep members focused and on common ground. Review Meetings that revisit action outcomes are generally held 6 – 9 months after the initial meeting.[4]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  If followed, the following list of principles and conditions contributes to the success of a Future Search meeting:""Get the “whole system” in the room. Invite a significant cross-section of all parties with a stake in the outcome.  Explore the “whole elephant” before seeking to fix any part. Get everyone talking about the same world. Think globally, act locally.  Put common ground and future focus front and center while treating problems and conflicts as information, not action items.  Encourage self-management and responsibility for action by participants before, during, and after the Future Search.  Urge full attendance – keep part-time participants to a minimum.  Meet under healthy conditions – this means airy rooms with windows, healthy snacks and meals, adequate breaks.  Work across three days (sleep twice) – people need “soak time” to take in everything that happens.  Ask for voluntary public commitments to specific next steps before people leave.""[5]Want to contribute an analysis of this method?

The purpose of these acts was to correct the relative opacity of the last administration, which has long been criticized for its overly-private nature and lack of transparency all together. President Obama's first executive act, issued on January 21,2009 in his Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government, set forth among other things, that, ""We will work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration, openness will strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in Government."" [6]Origins and DevelopmentOn his first day in Office, President Obama signed the Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government, ushering in a new era of open and accountable government meant to bridge the gap between the American people and their government.Soon after announcing his Open Government initiative in January 2009, President Obama and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) launched the first public comment on an Executive Order [9]. In February 2009, The State Department launched “Sounding Board,” an electronic suggestion box for feedback from the general public and workforce. [10] Soon after in March, during the Open for Questions Town Hall, the President answered questions that were submitted and voted on transparently by the public [11].On December 8, 2009, the White House issued an unprecedented Open Government Directive requiring federal agencies to take immediate, specific steps to achieve key milestones in transparency, participation, and collaboration. Progress on this initiative can be tracked across the Executive Branch on the Open Government Dashboard, and in the White House Progress Report to the American People. [3]How It WorksThe Open Government Directive mandates that each sector of the government make all publicly-available material accessible online. Each sector’s catalog must be accessible to the all members of the public. [16]According to the Directive, by February 6th*, each department must set up a website at agencyx.gov/open with not only the text of the plan, but also tools with which members of the public can comment on on the plan and the agency's commitment to open government. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) specifies that open government sites should ""serve as the gateway for agency activities related to the Open Government Directive"" and each agency ""shall maintain and update that webpage in a timely fashion.""Within 45 days, each agency, in consultation with the OMB, shall designate a high- level senior official to be held accountable for the quality, objectivity and internal controls of the Federal spending information publicly disseminated. Each agency shall also identify and publish online in an open format at least three high-value data sets...and register those data sets via Data.gov,"" reads the directive. ""These must be data sets not previously available online or in a downloadable format.""Within 60 days, the deputy director shall issue a separate, mini-directive detailing the specifics of the ""high-quality data"" that the White House requests the agencies submit to its central clearinghouses like USASpending.gov. Also within 60 days, the Federal Chief Information Officer and the Federal Chief Technology Officer shall create an Open Government Dashboard onwww.whitehouse.gov/open""  . ""The Open Government Dashboard will make available each agency’s Open Government Plan, together with aggregate statistics and visualizations designed to provide an assessment of the state of open government in the Executive Branch and progress over time toward meeting the deadlines for action outlined in this Directive.""Within 90 days, the Deputy Director for Management at OMB will issue, through separate guidance or as part of any planned comprehensive management guidance, a framework for how agencies can use challenges, prizes, and other incentive-backed strategies to find innovative or cost-effective solutions to improving open government.""Analysis and Lessons LearnedLeft somewhat untouched in the White House's released version of its Open Government Directive (OGD) are three central factors: transparency, participation and collaboration. The OGD encourages agencies to involve citizens in the practice of government, but does no offer much in the way of guidance in figuring out to complete that challenging task.Furthermore, much of what agencies can and can't do online is shaped by policy barriers, even when those are mostly legalistic in nature. In such cases, the OMB typically relies on the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to navigate these issues.Within 120 days, OIRA must ""review existing OMB policies, such as Paperwork Reduction Act guidance and privacy guidance, to identify impediments to open government and to the use of new technologies and, where necessary, issue clarifying guidance and/or propose revisions to such policies, to promote greater openness in government."" [2]Overall there is a general sense of approval for Obama's open government directive as the initiative really does provide transparency and openness within/for the United States.  Since the Open Government Directive was signed into force, the majority of government departments and agencies have taken steps to increase their transparency. In May 2009, Data.gov had just 47 data sets and, by 2016, it had more than 168,000 [1]. In the same year, White House spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield noted that the evaluators of the audit gave almost half of the agencies scores of 80% or higher, while a ""vast majority"" had scores of over 70%. [3] The Obama Administration has also notedthat similar transparency and participation measures have been taken across the world.Yet there is still some criticism of the directive. Many who disprove of the directive are worried about people's over-expectations of this initiative to make the government work well. While they argue that more than transparency is needed to fix American government, there is still general agreement that this is a good stepping stone to the future of a transparent government for the people, of the people, and by the people. “It is this spirit of innovation that is most compelling about the tools and data released to date. While the Open Government Directive has yet to create radical transformations in government, its most important contribution may be a new culture of openness.” [6]References1.

Community scorecards (CSCs) are citizen-driven accountability measures that enhance citizens' civic involvement and voices and complement conventional supply-side mechanisms of accountability, such as political checks and balances, accounting and auditing systems, administrative rules, and legal procedures. As a community-based social accountability tool, the CSC allows citizens to participate directly or indirectly in demanding accountability from service providers and public officials and can be used to gather feedback from service users and improve communication between communities and service providers.[1]  Origins and Development  Participant Recruitment and Selection  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  In the United States, the CSC has been piloted as a strategic planning and performance management tool for communities to make informed decisions about critical issues for civic accountability. In Africa and Asia, the CSC has been successfully integrated with healthcare, education, sanitation and other sectors, resulting in increased community ownership to services, trust of public institutions and healthcare providers, and enhanced performance of health facilities, resulting in improved equity, access, quality and healthcare.[2]  The CSC process generally includes the use of  focus groups  and facilitated interface meetings which provide service users with the opportunity to give systematic and constructive feedback to service providers about their performance. Face-to-face meetings also help service providers learn directly from service users about which aspects of their services and programs are working well and which aspects are not.[3]  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Analysis and Lessons Learned  See AlsoCARE Community Score CardEngaging Girls through Dialogue, Community Scorecards and Advocacy to Combat Early Pregnancy in BeninReferences  [1]David Post, Sanjay Agarwal, and Varsha Venugopal, ""Rapid Feedback: The Role of Community Scorecards in Improving Service Delivery,"" The World Bank, 2014,  https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/18975?locale-attribute=es[2] Anbrasi Edward, Kojo Osei-Bonsu, Casey Branchini, Temor shah Yarghal, Said Habib Arwal, and Ahmad Jan Naeem.

5827,method,Gamification ,https://participedia.net/method/5827,"Gamification has traditionally been used by corporations as a marketing tool to attract customers, but it is increasingly being used by government and non-governmental organizations to engage citizens and increase participation in public decision-making.",0,2019-06-07,2022-01-19,8540,gisgueo,https://participedia.net/user/8540,419431,laura.junglas,https://participedia.net/user/419431,en,0,both,,open,,,,experiential, participatory, research,individuals,,,no_geo,,,informal,,,,,,,,,,," Problems and Purpose  Gamification describes the transfer of games into areas that have no relation to games. This can also apply to individual game elements such as certain game mechanics or game designs.  One of the areas where gamification is used as a method is education. Education in this context refers to informal, non-formal and formal education for all age groups. However, game-based learning is more than just entertainment, it builds a bridge between theory and practice, encourages learners to actively engage and interact with each other, and also creates a stimulating and inclusive learning atmosphere.  In addition to other areas of education, game-based learning has proven to be a particularly useful and effective method for teaching democratic values and norms. This is because gamification is so well suited to illustrate social interactions such as conflict and cooperation.Gamification allows even complex topics to be taught in an interesting and effective way, and players learn important competencies and awareness for their role as democratic citizens[1].  Origins and Development  Using games in education as a learning method is not an entirely new development. Nevertheless, the use of game-based learning methods is often not taken seriously, especially in the field of formal and higher education, for example at university. Gamification has received broader attention due to the digitalization of society taking place at the beginning of the 21st century. However, this also means that the focus is still on digital and less on analog games and game-based learning methods[1].  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Gamification can and is applied in various areas. As mentioned before, the term simply describes the transfer of game elements to areas that actually have no relation to games. Therefore, the question of participant recruitment and selection can be answered in different ways.  As far as the educational context is concerned, there is actually no area that cannot benefit from gamification. This applies to formal, informal, and non-formal education and to young learners as well as older ones. Gamification can be used in the traditional school classroom as well as at the university or in non-formal youth work.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Used in education, gamification helps to actively engage learners in the learning process. Players learn through the experiences they make during the game process. Based on Kolb's learning cycle, this means a multi-stage process that ""starts with a new concrete experience which is followed by reflective observation, abstract conceptualization and active experimentation"". To achieve the best possible outcome for the learners, this process is framed by an input and an output phase. The input phase is used to introduce the players to the game and explain the rules. In the output phase, a debriefing takes place and the players reflect on the game process and their learning outcomes. A special feature compared to more traditional learning methods is that gamification offers the possibility to combine theoretical knowledge and its practical application[1].

He was convinced that participatory processes were crucial for developing the social will to implement policies related to sustainability. Yet he also found the costs associated with many of these processes to be quite high for his rural and frugal State, so he was continually on the lookout for new possibilities. [1]  Origins and Development  In 2006, Manfred Hellrigl began experimenting with the  Wisdom Council model . [2] He soon renamed the format ""Bürgerrat"", which translates as Civic Council or Citizens' Council.  Kairos and the European Institute for Public Participation conducted an external evaluation of Bürgerräte in Vorarlberg, which was published in 2012 and also translated into English. [3]  By 2014, there were 32 different and successful instances where this model had been applied within the state of Vorarlberg [4] while by April 2018, the participation.at website reported 24 non-Vorarlberg case studies using this format.  The model has also been spreading to Germany, where it was used  by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment (BMUB) for their Integrated Environmental Plan 2030 (IUP). For this project, they organized six Citizens’ Councils in six major cities in Germany. [5] Some variation of this model is also being used in a participatory project in Berlin. [6]Anecdotal evidence is of mostly positive outcomes, which seems to be further evidenced by the method's growing popularity. Clearly, more research needs to be done; and more English-language translations of these growing numbers of case studies would be very helpful as well.  Since that assessment in 2011, there have been two particularly significant projects utilizing Civic Councils. One took place in  Mauthausen  in 2013, as part of a larger participatory project at the site of a former concentration camp. The second was an award-winning project sponsored by the State of Vorarlberg in 2015 on the topic of  Asylum and Refugee Policies .  Over time, the Vorarlberg model has distinguished itself in at least four different ways from the original  Wisdom Council process:the use of stratified  sortition  processes, instead of simple random selection;  the use of a concise briefing at the beginning of the process;  the use of the  World Cafe  format to host the Civic Café after the smaller Council has completed their work;  the addition of a ""Responder's Group"" that follows through on the outcomes of the process. [7]At the same time, a significant point of continuity between the Vorarlberg Bürgerräte or Citizens' Councils, and the Wisdom Councils that inspired this model, has been the use of  Dynamic Facilitation  to create a psychologically safe environment where participants can engage creatively with differences. [8]  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Participants are chosen through  sortition . The process is designed to ensure stratified random selection so that the microcosm reflects the make-up of the larger population.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The Vorarlberg Bürgerrat method generally involves the 4 steps described below. [9]  Citizen Council: over the course of a day and a half, between 10 to 30 randomly selected citizens work out a joint statement (not open to the public). If there are more than 15 participants, the group is subdivided into two working groups. They carry out their work with the support of two moderators trained in  Dynamic Facilitation.Citizen Café: the findings of the Citizen Council are presented to the public at a large gathering convened using the  World Café  methodology. Usually there may be between 50 - 100 people attending. After some brief introductions by the sponsoring organization, and the report by the Council itself, participants are invited to join in a deeper conversation at their smaller tables before reporting out to the larger group.  Responder Team: a team including professionals involved with the issue under discussion at the institutional level is created, in order to review the Citizen Council's findings and to monitor their implementation. This team traditionally also includes one or more community members from the Citizens' Café.  Documentation &amp; Next Steps: The documentation encompasses the findings of the Council and the results from the Café, providing the informational groundwork for further conversation among both community members and government.  In cases where the Bürgerrat has been sponsored by the State government instead of at a more local level, the Vorarlberg State Parliament will issue a detailed review assessing the measures that have been taken and/or need to be taken.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  In 2014, the Bür füe Zukunftsfragen published an “Interim Report”,  which included the perspective of policy-makers, state and local administrators, and Council participants, on their experiences with the Citizens' Councils. The report also includes both supportive and critical perspectives from academic experts. [10]In 2020, the Citizens' Councils that originated in Vorarlberg were named as #6 of 12 innovations in citizens' participation, by an OECD  report titled ""  Innovative Citizen Participation and New Democratic Institutions  "".Analysis and Lessons LearnedIn the recent OECD report [11], the first four models they list( Citizens' Assemblies ,  Citizens' Juries ,  Consensus Conferences , and  Planning Cells ) are categorized as ""informed citizen recommendations on policy questions""; they all require between three to 18 days of in-person  deliberation . In contrast, the next five models described in the report (G1000, Citizens' Councils, Citizens' Dialogues,  Deliberative Polls , and  WWViews ) are categorized as “citizen opinion on policy questions”, as they generally involve between one-to-two days of deliberation. The Citizens’ Council model is an example of how, when done well, even a less intensive format can produce useful results. [11]  See AlsoWisdom Council ProcessReferences  [1]  Hellrigl, M. (2012).

Participant Recruitment and Selection  Participants are recruited through the ""snowball"" method — that is, starting from institutional figures, who usually coincide with the clients, the method proceeds by asking who else should be interviewed, possibly with positions and points of view from their own.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The interviews, usually collected through ""snowball"" recruitment (asking the interviewees who else should have been interviewed), provide the narrative elements for a multi-part composition of the question / problem under investigation. The polyphonic narrative is an open system and its ""representative"" force is based on giving voice, as far as possible, to all points of view, even to the most idiosyncratic and to the most ""unpleasant"" ones [1]. Interviews can be interspersed with public presentations and representativeness checks.  Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsKnow what outcomes and effects this method typically has?

The day and time of the weekly meetings of the Neighbourhood Groups are decided by consensus on the first day of the formation of a Neighbourhood Group.All members are expected to regularly attend the weekly meetings.The quorum is set at 75 percent.  The major and most popular activity of the Neighbourhood Groups is thrift and microcredit.All members must deposit a minimum amount as thrift.This minimum is the weekly savings that the poorest member of the group can afford.After three months of weekly meetings and savings, the group can lend money to the members with interest.Members put forward requests for loans in weekly meetings and loans are granted on the basis of priority.  The decisions on who gets the priority on loans and the interest rates are made either by consensus or voting after deliberations among the members.After discussion, members can also decide on the other activities they want to undertake as a group.This can include collective framing on fallow land and micro-enterprises (such as food products, apparels, toiletries, handicrafts, café, and catering services).  Neighborhood Group meetings are also spaces to discuss local issues that need to be raised in the Gram or Ward Sabha meetings of the local self-government.The Neighborhood Groups are supposed to work with the local self-government bodies in the planning and implementation of development needs of the locality.Through deliberation, Neighborhood Groups are encouraged to create “micro-plans” which the local self-governing institutions should take into consideration in formulating their own plans through wider public discussion.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Currently there are around comprising291,507 Neighborhood Groups operating in Kerala as part of the mission and, as of May 2019, they have collected around 47.52 billion Rupees (634.29 million USD) as thrift and there are around 2600 small-scale enterprises managed by Kudumbashree members ( http://www.kudumbashree.org/pages/518 ).

The Indian constitution defines Gram Sabha as “a body consisting of persons registered in the electoral rolls relating to a village comprised within the area of Panchayat at the village level” and Panchayat as “an institution of self-government constituted […] for rural areas.”The purpose of the Panchayat Raj is to secure greater citizen participation in formulating and implementing plans for economic development and social justice at the level of villages.Gram Sabhas are forums where all voting citizens can deliberate and decide on these plans according to the needs of their villages.  The power and functions of the Panchayats and the Gram Sabhas in a state, according to the constitutions, are to be determined by laws enacted by the individual state legislatures.The Government of Kerala enacted the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act in 1994 to implement the constitutional mandate.The Act has been amended several times since 1994.Among these amendments the amendments made in 1999 were comprehensive and strengthened the powers and functions of the Panchayats and the Gram Sabhas in Kerala.In the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act,  Gram  is spelled as  Grama  in accordance with the local pronunciation of the word.Origins and DevelopmentArticle 40 of the Indian Constitution (adopted in 1950) directs the state to work for the organization of village panchayats and give them such powers and authority that they can function as self-government units.The full implementation of this directive occurred only in 1992 with the 73 rd  Constitutional Amendment Act.In the intervening period there were two major efforts to establish Panchayats in Indian villages.The first effort came with the recommendations of the Balwant Rai Mehta Committee in 1957 for setting up of a three-tiered Panchayat system – Gram Panchayat at the village level, Panchayat Samiti at the block level, and Zila Parishad at the district level – for greater participation of people in central government’s rural development plans.By 1959 all states passed their Panchayat Acts and by mid-1960s new Panchayat institutions, in accordance with the 1957 recommendations, were constituted all over the country.These were the first-generation Panchayat Raj institutions.The next generation of panchayats emerged from the recommendation of the Ashok Mehta Committee constituted in 1977.This Committee pointed out the importance of vibrant Gram Sabhas for establishing a decentralized democratic polity, but due to public apathy and official neglect Gram Sabhas were not functioning properly in the country.A few states made changes to their Panchayat Acts based on Ashok Mehta Committee’s recommendations.Subsequently, two further committees were constituted to study the workings of the Panchayat system – the G.V.K. Rao Committee (1985) and the L.M. Singhvi Committee (1986).These committees identified the lack of constitutional safeguard as the impediment for the proper functioning of Panchayats.This argument became the basis for the 73rd Constitution Amendment Act of 1992, that came into effect in April 1993.This led to the third generation of Panchayat Raj institutions.Each state government had to enact legislation in their respective state legislature with details on the composition, elections and the power and functions of the Panchayat institutions in accordance with the new constitutional amendment.  In the state of Kerala, the third generation of Panchayat Raj institutions were created through the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act of 1994.Kerala is the one of the 28 states (provinces) that constitute the Union of India located in the South-West of Indian subcontinent.The state was formed in 1956 by merging all predominantly Malayalam speaking regions in South India into one state.This included the Malabar district and some parts of the South Canara district of then state of Madras (Madras Presidency of British India) and the Travancore-Cochin state (formed in 1949 by combining the semi-autonomous princely states of Travancore and Cochin of the colonial period).  Each of these regions – Madras, Travancore, and Cochin – had established panchayats during the colonial period to aid local governance.In Madras, the Madras Act No. V of 1884 established a three-tier system of rural government.Later through Madras Village Panchayat Act of 1920 all men over the age of 25 were given voting rights for village panchayats and the post-independent 1950 Madras Village Panchayat Act granted more autonomy to village panchayats.In Cochin and Travancore, the respective governments there passed the Cochin Village Panchayat Act, 1914 and the Travancore Village Panchayat Act, 1925 for the formation of village panchayats.In the post-independent period, these village panchayats were governed by the 1950 Travancore-Cochin Panchayat Act.At the time of its formation in 1956 Kerala had 892 panchayats.  The first elected government of Kerala under E.M.S. Namboodiripad introduced the Kerala Panchayat Bill of 1958 in the legislative assembly for the purposes of administrative reforms.Since the central government dismissed the Namboodiripad government in 1959 this Bill lapsed.The subsequent government, considering the Balwant Rai Committee recommendations, enacted the Kerala Panchayat Act of 1960, seeking to increase the financial scope and functional area of the Panchayats.The new Act led to the formation of 922 village Panchayats in 1964.Despite the widening of its functions by law the village Panchayats continued to perform its traditional civic roles.[1]Between 1964 and the passage of the Seventy-Third Constitution Amendment Act of 1992 there were other efforts taken by different governments in Kerala to strengthen the Panchayat system.The constitutional amendment of 1992 provided fresh impetus to the idea of decentralized democracy in India.In Kerala, the state government enacted the new Kerala Panchayat Raj Act in 1994 for the implementation of the constitutional provisions.Elections were held in 1995 and new Panchayats were constituted to operate as constitutional bodies and as the third tier of governance.  Kerala went one step ahead of the constitutional mandate when in 1996 the Left Democratic Front government launched a participatory planning initiative called the People’s Plan Campaign and decided to provide 35 to 40 percent plan funds to local governments.Through this campaign the village panchayats and the urban municipalities prepared their own plans based on the felt needs of their people.There were five phases of this campaign.The first phase consisted of identifying local needs and problems through Grama Sabha meetings.The second stage entailed of “Development Seminars” at the panchayat level with representatives from the Grama Sabhas, local officials, and invited experts from the locality or from outside.The focus of this phase was to find integrated solutions to the needs and problems identified in the Grama Sabhas.The third phase constituted several “Task Forces” consisting of officials, activists, and experts to come up with specific solutions or schemes based on the broad solutions arrived in the development seminars.The fourth phase involved creation of the plan document by the panchayat based on schemes prepared by the task forces.The fifth phase consisted of integration of local plans (panchayat level) and the creation of plans for higher tiers of local self-government (that is, block panchayats and district panchayats).[2]Concurrently a committee (called the Committee on Decentralization of Powers) headed by S.B. Sen recommended certain institutional reforms to strengthen the Panchayats including the role of Grama Sabhas in the functioning of the Panchayats.These recommendations led to several amendments to the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act in 1999.Thirty-five other State Acts were also amended, and a series of rules and procedures were evolved to facilitate the smooth functioning of the provisions of the amended Panchayat Raj Act.[3] This institutionalized the new system that emerged as a result of the People’s Plan Campaign. [4]Participant Recruitment and SelectionThe organization of Panchayats and Gram Sabhas in Indian villages is mandated by the Indian constitution since 1993.The Kerala Panchayat Raj Act of 1994, which has been amended several times since 1994, lays out the details of the precise composition, elections and powers and functions of the Panchayats in Kerala.The 1999 amendment provided a detailed list of the powers and functions of the Grama Sabha.  Since the panchayats in Kerala are large in terms of population (averaging more than 20,000), compared to panchayats in rest of India, each electoral ward (constituency) of the panchayats has its own Grama Sabha.Grama Sabhas are required to meet at least once in three months.Prior to the 1999 amendments to the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act, the frequency of Grama Sabha meetings was two meetings in a year.  The panchayat member of the ward is the convenor of these meetings.As the convenor, the ward member has the responsibility to provide adequate notice and to advertise the meetings.The ward member should also invite the elected members of the Block and District Panchayats as well as the Member of the Legislative Assembly and the Member of the Parliament to these meetings.  An official from the Panchayat acts as a coordinator to assist the convenor (the ward member) in convening and conducting the meeting.In addition, the Panchayat appoints facilitators for the general preparations for the meeting, for making presentations and for leading small group discussions.  The meetings are to be presided either by the Panchayat president or the vice-president and in their absence by the Panchayat member of that ward.Apart from the mandated meetings of the Grama Sabha, a special meeting of the Grama Sabha can also be convened with a written request and an agenda for the meeting from at least ten per cent of the members of the Sabha.Such special meeting can be only called once within the period between two general meetings.As of 2015, there are 941 Grama Panchayats with a total of 4982 Grama Sabhas in Kerala.[5]  According to the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act, all those who are included in the electoral roll of a ward are considered members of the Grama Sabha of that ward.The quorum for the Sabha meetings is ten percent of the membership.However, if a meeting is postponed due to lack of quorum then the second meeting can be held with fifty members in attendance.  An organizing committee at the ward level is constituted, prior to the meeting, for distribution of the notice of meeting to all households in the ward and for campaign to ensure good participation in the meeting.The ward member and the Panchayat has the responsibility to provide adequate notice (at least seven days before the meeting) to the members about the Sabha meetings.Apart from distribution of the notice to every house in the ward, pamphlets are distributed, and posters posted in public spaces.The signature of one member of the household is taken as acknowledgement of the receipt of notice.The Panchayat use the services of Neighborhood Groups (such as that of the Kudumbashree Mission), other self-help groups, and community-based organizations as well as local sports and cultural clubs to publicize Grama Sabha meetings.How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-MakingConcurrent to the 1996 People’s Plan Campaign the Kerala government had appointed a Committee on Decentralization of Power headed by S.B Sen. This Committee took into account the experiences of the People’s Plan Campaign and recommended that the powers and functions of the Grama Sabha should be laid out in the Panchayat Raj Act in Kerala.Thus, the 1999 Amendment to the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act provided a detailed list of the powers, functions, and rights of the Grama Sabhas.  Grama Sabhas are to formulate development plans, fix priority for the development and social welfare programmes, prepare beneficiary list for the welfare programmes, where necessary mobilize resources for the development plans and to monitor the implementation of development and welfare plans in a village.The Sabhas have a right to know the rationale of every decision taken by the Panchayat.  Public deliberation is the key feature of Grama Sabhas as forum for the direct participation of people in matters of local governance and development.A typical Grama Sabha meeting in Kerala starts with an inaugural or plenary session with felicitation speech(es) and explanation of the purpose and the structure of the meeting followed by presentations on agenda items by the facilitators of the meeting.The other activities that form part of a Grama Sabha meeting is general discussion on issues related to the ward or sometimes individual problems faced by members.Members can also ask questions to the elected members and officials present in the meeting.At times, the Grama Sabha is divided into groups for focused discussion on various aspects.The minutes of the group discussion is brought back to the closing plenary session.In this session the members collectively take the final decisions and pass different resolutions.Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsThe Grama Sabhas as constitutional bodies got their due recognition in Kerala only after the People’s Plan Campaign of 1996.T.M. Thomas Isaac, who was in charge of the campaign during his tenure as Member of the Kerala State Planning Board and has written extensively on the campaign, notes:  One of the greatest achievements of the People’s Campaign has been in dispelling the general attitude of scepticism towards  gram sabhas .It was previously considered impossible to have effective functioning of these bodies as instruments of participatory local government for practical reasons.[…] through adopting a group discussion format and with careful preparations, the  gram sabhas  functioned successfully.The success of  gram sabhas  varied from panchayat to panchayat.But it can be definitely said that the  gram sabhas  have become an essential feature of Kerala’s political landscape. [6]  Over 2.5 million people with an average of 180 persons per Grama Sabha participated in the initial round (August-September 1996) of Grama Sabhas organized under the Campaign. [7] Although the numbers declined in the subsequent round, the campaign established the Grama Sabhas as important component of local planning and governance. [8]  Grama Sabhas became sites of selection of beneficiaries of development and welfare schemes as a result of the People’s Plan Campaign.The aim was to reduce nepotism and the practice of using beneficiary schemes for patronage by local leaders.[9] This change was made a legal requirement with the amendments to the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act in 1999 specifying the powers and functions of the Grama Sabha.The newly inserted Article 3A of the Act which specified the powers, function and rights of the Grama Sabha had these two clauses among others: “to prepare and submit to the Village Panchayat a final list of eligible beneficiaries in the order of priority relating to the beneficiary oriented schemes on the basis of the criteria fixed;” and “to verify the eligibility of persons getting various kinds of welfare assistance from the Government such as pensions and subsidies.” Analysts note that preparation and verification of the beneficiary list by the Grama Sabhas has reduced the possibility of ineligible persons benefitting from welfare schemes. [10]  Reports prepared by the Kerala Institute of Local Administration provide specific outcomes of some of the Grama Sabhas operating in Kerala. [11]Analysis and Lessons LearnedGrama Sabhas are forums for the participation of people in managing the affairs of their villages.Attendance in the Sabhas could be the simplest measure to gauge people’s participation and enthusiasm for these meetings.Low attendance has been a problem since the beginning.The attendance level improved during the People’s Plan Campaign of 1996.As noted above, over 2.5 million people across Kerala participated in Grama Sabhas during initial rounds, but this accounted for only around 10 per cent of the voting population in Kerala. [12] It is reported that the enthusiasm for Grama Sabha meetings has declined since then and that quorum for the meetings in many panchayats are often contrived.A 2004 report in the national news magazine  Frontline  states: “The fear about the future of the decentralisation experiment in Kerala are coming true.People are staying away from the gram and ward sabhas in the invigorated panchayats, municipalities and corporations in the State and, as a result, the most exciting programme to empower citizens is seemingly running in trouble.In the majority of local bodies, attendance registers are being fudged regularly to fake the quorum at gram/ward sabha meetings.” [13]A government-appointed committee to evaluate decentralization also notes this allegation of manipulating attendance registers and that “in many wards the minimum of 50 (this is the quorum in case in the first meeting you do not get the statutory minimum of 10%) was the rule than the exception.” [14] One reason cited by the committee for the decline in participation has been that Grama Sabhas have turned into “forums of beneficiaries.” [15] Since most of the beneficiaries are the poor, “the educated youth, middle class and upper class shied away from such meetings.” [16]Among the poor “beneficiaries,” too, participation declines when the benefits they seek do not materialize. [17] With low attendance in Grama Sabhas there is a danger of the return of nepotism and a patronage system in beneficiary selection.  The Grama Sabhas’ transformation into “beneficiary forums” also affects the quality of debate and discussions in the Sabhas.Isaac and Ranke note that the quality of the deliberations had improved during the People’s Plan Campaign of 1996.They also concede that in many Panchayats the Grama Sabha meetings “lapsed into mere listing of local demands” while its objective was “to collectively analyze the reasons for the problems and talk about what people could do to help themselves.” [18] However, Issac and Ranke note that both the attendance and quality of deliberation improved over time during the campaign.In a recent interview concerning the launch of another round of People’s Campaign by his government, Isaac, now Kerala’s Minister of Finance, deplored the low quality of deliberations in the Grama Sabhas and attributes it to the non-participation of the educated in these meetings.“The problem with grama sabhas in Kerala is that educated people do not come there.That means the quality of deliberations in gram[a] sabhas is very low.”[19]One suggested solution is to tackle low attendance and to improve the quality of deliberation by holding small neighborhood meetings prior to the Grama Sabha.Such Neighborhood meetings were formed in some panchayats during the People’s Plan Campaign.[20]See AlsoPanchayat RajKerala Panchayati Raj Planning &amp; BudgetingReferences[1]For this view and a historical account of Panchayat related reforms in Kerala see“Report of the Committee for Evaluation of Decentralised Planning and Development, March 2009, Government of Kerala,” 18–20, accessed July 20, 2018, http://www.panchayatgyan.gov.in/documents/30336/0/15+Goverment+of+kerala.pdf/27058cb3-4156-44e1-bdbd-73ffdf9228cd.

This enables the identification of the most appropriate policy design principles, practices and pathways (or ingredients, recipes, and meal planning to build on the metaphor established by Archon Fung).[1] i4Policy, thereby, facilitates the use of different (and even seemingly contradictory and distinct) approaches. A single i4Policy process may, for example, juxtapose inclusive, deliberative, and elite activities while featuring both unitary and adversarial approaches and decision-rules.[2] The framework also helps to simplify and communicate the overall policy-making process to facilitate collaboration amongst “policy users” (the people affected by public policy), experts, and policy makers.  i4Policy is also designed to popularize and bring to life what Rao calls “reflectivism”: policy-making that emphasizes processes and incrementally addresses systems-level outcomes, such as pedagogy, empathy, social cohesion, self-efficacy, agency, and structural transformation.[3]  Origins and Development  The i4Policy process was originally developed by Jon Stever. Stever co-founded the Innovation for Policy Foundation to further the development and use of the process, and associated open source co-creation tools, methodologies, protocols and software. The i4Policy process emerged from a practice-based design, and remains under continued, iterative development through practice, research and dialogue with practitioners, academics, policy professionals, trainees and participants.  In addition to the process, i4policy may also refer to both the Foundation ( i4policy.org ) and to a grassroots movement (#i4Policy; innovators for policy). The #i4Policy movement was collaboratively initiated by innovation community leaders across Africa, and brings together community conveners who share common values and an interest to deploy co-creation methodologies to support their governments with innovative policy-making for innovation (this is articulated in the i4policy Manifesto, which was co-created by community conveners and citizens across 45 countries in Africa).[4]i4Policy v3.1 is licensed CC-BY-SA 4.0 by the Innovation for Policy Foundation, 2019.How it Worksi4Policy v3.1 has three main phases and 11 action stages. The process is iterative and non-linear.Agenda Setting Phase:The phase in which issues are recognized as public concerns and seriously debated by politically-relevant actors. Common interests are understood and formed, specific problem statements are defined, weighed and prioritized to establish a user-centered agenda for reform.  The Agenda Setting phase has four stages:Empathize:  Map the needs, constraints, and influence of actors to understand potential policy reform pathwaysUnite:  Build a unifying commoninterest that can mobilize policy users, experts and policy makers behind reformDefine:  Articulateclear and concise problem statements, descriptions of the specific issues or conditions to be addressed, in order to achieve the common interestPrioritise:  Rank problem statements based on their impact and urgency to set the agendaDrafting Phase:Potential solutions are explored and developed into concrete proposals and policy instruments (laws, strategies, policies, visions, regulatory changes, institutional design, etc). Draft policy proposals are then reviewed by experts and users, with iterative feedback loops of further ideation, design, review and consultation.  The Drafting phase has four stages:Ideate: brainstorm potential solutions to address the prioritized policy agendaDesign:  Iteratively transformthe policy ideas into concrete policy propositions through co-creationReview:  Analyze the technical, operational, legal, financial, economic and social impacts of the policyConsult:  Host open and/or discursive platforms and forums to collect and organize policy user feedbackImplementation Phase:Policies are proposed and adopted through appropriate rule-making processes. Evaluations are then conducted throughout implementation to inform policy delivery, review performance against goals, and to support policy iteration.  The implementation phase has three stages:Adopt:  Propose and enact the reviewed and consulted policy frameworkDeliver:  Operationalize the policy framework. This may include piloting and sandboxing.Evaluate:  Track the policy implementation transparently against its intended outcomes.Analysis and Lessons LearnedThe process has been initiated (in whole or in part) for policy reform processes in 13 African countries (as of 03/2020). This has resulted in a number of concrete policies being collaboratively developed, including a national vision, policies, strategies and two laws, including the Senegal Startup Act that was passed in December 2019. The co-creation processes have also influenced pan-African policies, such as the AU's 2020-2030 Digital Transformation Strategy.

The purpose of the new model, named “Decision-focused Public Engagement Table” (DPET), was to better inform difficult, values-laden vaccine policy decisions, potentially earn support for them, and build a better, more trusting relationship between the CDC and the public.  According to the National Coalition for Dialogue and Deliberation (NCDD), there are four major purposes for using the techniques that are at the heart of public engagement. They are (1) to learn more about people or issues, (2) to resolve conflicts, (3) to influence public decisions, and (4) to act collaboratively to solve problems. Using the DPET model, the nine projects in this report were decision-focused, that is, conducted for the purpose of helping to better inform and potentially influence decision makers on public policy issues. Secondary purposes were to increase support for the final decisions made and to enhance trust between citizens and government.  Beginning in 2005, the DPET model or modified versions of it were used in  nine public engagement projects  that initiated by  CDC  and/or the  National Vaccine Program Office at the Department of Health and Human Services , the parent Department for the CDC.  One of these nine projects was a grant program to six state health departments to assess the feasibility of the DPET model at the local level.  Origins and Development  These projects were initiated “top-down” by government agencies and/or a non-governmental organization (NGO) seeking consultation from the public on pending decisions, as opposed to being organized at the grassroots level by citizens interested in solving a problem or stimulating government to act on a problem. The subject area was chosen by the government, not the public.  Participant Recruitment and SelectionTarget number of 100 citizens-at-large  Participants selected from the four geographic segments of the population  Participants representative of their area by age, race, and sex  Normally 20-30 stakeholders from approximately 10 key sectors of interest  Includes agency or sponsor’s staff persons as stakeholdersHow it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-MakingProblem Solving Stage:  Problem solving includes: (1) problem identification or definition, (2) gathering information about or determining the causes of the problem, (3) designing or finding options to address the problem, (4) discussing pros and cons of the options, (5) weighing the options for a solution, (6) choosing a best solution, (7) implementing the chosen solution, and (8) evaluating an implemented solution.  In these decision-focused public engagement projects, the focus was on obtaining the public’s contributions to the discussing, weighing, and choosing stages. These stages are closer in sequence to the final decision, thereby increasing the potential for the participants to have more direct and traceable influence over the final choice made by decision makers. It was also assumed that this type of work on the part of the participants would have positive implications for the level of satisfaction participants might experience, and for the accountability of decision-makers.Choice of Publics:  Early on in any consultation exercise, sponsors need to make a decision about what publics they wish to engage. The most fundamental choice is whether to include citizens-at-large with no recognized interests, or stakeholders who are representatives of organizations with recognized interests. The choice made with the DPET model was to include both the general public and the stakeholder public. This decision made it more difficult to achieve agreement on a single public perspective to be conveyed to the sponsoring organization, but was thought to have the advantage of providing advice that was more fully considered.Mandates:  The agencies implementing this model were not mandated by law to involve citizens in their decision making process. All of the topics placed on the table for public engagement were chosen voluntarily by the sponsors. This feature was included with the assumption that it would increase the degree of commitment by the sponsors to consider the advice received from the public.Governance Level:  Also, since the CDC is a federal agency and the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) represents all state health departments in the US, these projects were carried out (with one exception) as national-level projects with the goal of assisting in the work of a federal agency or non-governmental organization with nationwide responsibilities. Such projects have unique elements not found to the same degree at the community level, such as challenges in motivating citizens to participate or in achieving adequate representation.Commitment Level:  Finally, the DPET model was initially proposed for ongoing public engagement with creation of a standing agency infrastructure. In practice, these projects were carried out on an  ad hoc  basis project by project. Creating a standing support infrastructure has implications for the kind and quality of resources and expertise that would be available for individual projects and the amount of training required.Working DefinitionThe definition of decision-focused public engagement used to guide each of these projects was “The practice by which the agency or sponsoring organization very actively involves members of the public-at-large and/or representatives of stakeholder organizations in group dialogue and deliberation sessions to better inform and possibly shape the agency or organization’s final policy decisions.”  The Decision-focused Public Engagement Table (DPET) Model  With the working definition of decision-focused public engagement described above, the DPET model had the following key features:A focus on undecided policy choices  Inclusion of representative groups of both stakeholders and citizens-at-large  Linkage with government decision makers  Neutral facilitation  Presentation of balanced information from credible sources  Frank dialogue and genuine deliberation  Reaching some form of group judgment or agreement  Synthesis of the results as the “public perspective” on the pending decision  Feedback to the participantsParticipants:Target number of 100 citizens-at-large  Participants selected from the four geographic segments of the population  Participants representative of their area by age, race, and sex  Normally 20-30 stakeholders from approximately 10 key sectors of interest  Includes agency or sponsor’s staff persons as stakeholdersMeetings:Four day-long dialogue and deliberation sessions for citizens  Stakeholders meet twice separately from the citizens-at-large, once before and after  Stakeholder meeting activities similar to those for citizens-at-large  Stakeholders can provide initial input in framing issues and designing process  Some stakeholders participate as observers at the larger citizens’ meetings  One or two citizens invited from each area to attend final stakeholder meetingInformation presented:Participants in general session hear an oral presentation in easy to understand language  Effective, non-condescending expert/lecturer presents the minimum amount of unbiased information needed to have an informed discussion of the issue at hand  Opportunities are given to ask questions about the factual information presented  Subject matter experts are on hand to answer questions but not to participate directly in the discussions  Booklet summarizing the key facts needed to have the conversation is presented in a user-friendly fashion  A discussion guide summarizing the choices faced is presented to the participants for use during small group table discussions and large group exchanges.Dialogue and deliberation:Neutral facilitation is provided  Participants in small groups listen respectfully, exchange experiences and viewpoints, and deepen their understanding of the issue on the table  Participants in general session listen and consider the views expressed by participants of other small groups and seek clarifications where necessary  Participants weigh the alternative courses of action brought forth at the meeting  Participants as a group vote or otherwise make their preferences known.  Opportunities are given for participants to react to the group findings and to introduce modifications if needed and agreed to by the group.Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Product and closure:Stakeholders consider citizen-at-large input, develop their own views, and synthesize the viewpoints into the “societal perspective” on the decision being placed on the table.  Agency or sponsor participants convey results to key decision makers.

Participatory approaches have been developed, but they can be both time consuming and lacking in transparency, meaning it is not possible to identify who contributed what.The ParEvo process design addresses both problems.  The ParEvo app has two broad purposes.The first is to enable participants to improve the design, monitoring, and evaluation of activities designed to bring about change.This is done through the participatory identification of alternative storylines/scenarios about what might happen in the future, and the evaluation of those storylines, and the analysis of the implications of those storylines. For more detail on how this can be done see the  Ten Stages Of A ParEvo Exercise  page  The second is to provide a platform where people can experiment with different ways of running participatory explorations of alternative futures.That is, a location where multiple ParEvo exercises will be carried out, and all the data from those exercises will be retained and available for comparison and analysis (subject to the consent of the Facilitators of those exercises).  ParEvo is different from many scenario planning approaches in the very structured nature of people’s participation, and the ability to analyse participation data and its relationship to the types of scenarios that are developed. One important source of theory and research findings to inform this kind of analysis is the field of  collective intelligence  (whereby groups can be more productive and creative than their best individual members).For more information on ways of analysing the content and participation dimensions of a ParEvo exercise go to the  Content Analysis  and  Participation Analysis  pages of the ParEvo website.  Origins and Development  The core concept was developed in the 1990s, during the development of Rick Davies’ PhD thesis on organisational learning in NGOs working in Bangladesh ( available here ). Its first trial implementation took place in a Welsh school classroom setting, before the widespread availability of the internet (documented  here ).  In 2019 a UK software company (Aptivate) was contracted to develop a web app to make this process available free and online to multiple parties.The new web-based version solicits, presents, and analyses the contents generated by participants on an automated, timely and error-free basis. It allows multiple groups to do so, via free accounts available on this dedicated ParEvo web site:  https://parevo.org/Further development is anticipated.This will include improvement of the user interface, more automated data analysis and visualisation, and options for significant scaling up of the numbers of participants. Suggestions are welcome.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  A ParEvo exercise involves people in four different roles, three of which are essential:  1. Participants : People who actively participate in the generation of alternative storylines about possible future developments.The minimum should be 4 people, 10 to 12 people is desirable, larger numbers may be possible but have not yet been tested.Participants’ can represent views which are personal, or those which reflect their elected or employed role, or those of other stakeholders.  2. Facilitator : A person who designs and manages a ParEvo exercise, including the selection and invitation of participants.Anyone can apply to be a Facilitator, via the ParEvo website:  https://parevo.org/3. Administrator : A person who authorises people to act as a Facilitator, and who provides technical advice and support to Facilitators as needed.Rick Davies is the Administrator ( rick.davies@gmail.com ).  4. Observers : People who are able to view a ParEvo exercise through a hypertext link provided to them by the Facilitator of that exercise.This role is optional, not a necessity. Observer access can be provided during and/or after the completion of a ParEvo exercise  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  How a ParEvo exercise works is described in the  How an Exercise Works page  on the ParEvo website and in a  twelve minute YouTube video . There are ten stages, three of which are reiterated:  1.Clarifying the aim of a ParEvo exercise  2.Identifying who will be involved  3.Describing the starting point of the process  4.Defining the endpoint  5.The facilitator provides guidance to participants  6.Participants make their contributions  7.Developing storylines are shared  8.Re-iteration of 5, 6, 7  9.Evaluation  10.Using the products of the ParEvo process  A ParEvo exercise begins with a seed paragraph, describing the beginning of a possible sequence of events. The exercise will then progress through a number of iterations, typically so far between six and twelve. In each iteration each participant will have the opportunity to add a paragraph of text which extends the seed paragraph, or after that, one of its developing storylines, in the direction of their choice. Storylines which are not extended become 'extinct""and not available for further development in later iterations. Other storylines may branch in different directions because multiple participants choose to add a contribution to it during the same iteration.  At the beginning of each iteration the Facilitator will update the guidance available to the participants at the head of the user interface where participants make their contributions. At the end of the chosen number of iterations the Facilitator will ask the participants to make some evaluation judgements of the surviving storylines. An aggregated view of these judgements is then made visible to the participants.  While the identity of participants in a ParEvo exercise may be known to all, the identity of individual contributions during the ParEvo exercise is intentionally not disclosed. This information is only available to the Facilitator.  Parameters are attributes of the ParEvo process that can be varied, to affect how storylines develop . They are of two types:  1.Thoseparticipantscan vary:Which storyline they decide to add to, in any given iteration  The contents of the contributions they make2.Those thefacilitatorcan vary:The number of participants  In a given exercise, and  Within each iteration of a given exercise  The types of participants  The text of the guidance that is given to participants at the start of each iteration  The maximum length of the text that participants can submit in each iteration  The duration of each iteration  The number of iterations  The evaluation criteria used at the evaluation stageInfluence, Outcomes, and Effects  A completed ParEvo exercise will provide participants with multiple detailed alternative views of the future, within the bounds defined at the beginning of the exercise. The storylines will have identifiable ownership. The probability and desirability of each storyline will also been identified by the participants, along any with other performance attributes selected by the Facilitator. In addition, as shown below, the Facilitator will have detailed data on how the storylines were constructed, which can be analysed and shared at their discretion.  The primary intended beneficiaries of this process would normally be participants themselves, and the Facilitator. However, important other stakeholders can be involved as Observers.  Please Note: There has not yet been any independent i.e. third-party evaluation, of the performance of ParEvo.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  DATA: Five types of data can be downloaded at the end of a ParEvo exercise:The full text of each storyline, showing which paragraph was contributed during which iteration.  A list the names of all participants  A matrix showing which participants contributed to which storyline.This is known as an “affiliation matrix”  A matrix showing which participant contributed additional text to which participant's previous contributions.This is known as an “adjacency matrix”  Matrices showing which storylines met which evaluation criteria, as judged by each participant.Plus, a summary matrix aggregating the judgements of all participants.ANALYSIS: This data can be analysed in three ways:Content Analysis: Four methods are described in detail on the  Content Analysis  webpage  Participation Analysis: Four broad types of analysis are described on the  participation analysis  webpage  Relating the Participation Analysis to the Content AnalyisedThe methods of analysis that have been documentso far have made use of two main areas of knowledge: social network analysis and studies of collective intelligence.See references below.

Origins and DevelopmentThe idea of citizen involvement in decision-making processes on science and technology gained traction in Europe in the late 1980s with theDanish Board of Technologyand the use ofconsensus conferences  .  In 2010, a group of educators, researchers, and policy practitioners launched the Expert and Citizen Assessment of Science and Technology (ECAST) network to conduct pTAs on complex, contested, and emergent science, technology, and societal issues in the United States. The network was based on the following objectives [1]:Participation and expertise:Incorporate effective citizen-participation methods to complement expert analysis.  21st-century structure:Develop a partially decentralized, agile and collaborative organizational structure, seeking effective technology assessment (TA), low cost and timeliness.  Continual innovation in concepts and practices:Encourage, evaluate and, as warranted, adopt new TA concepts and methods.  Nonpartisan structure and governance:Establish the ethos and institutional structures needed to ensure that any new TA institution is strictly non-partisan. When there are strongly divergent normative perspectives on a particular topic, individual TA projects can benefit from a balanced, overtly value-pluralistic or multi-partisan approach.  Commitment to transparent process and public results.After a demonstration project where the Danish Board of Technology’s project provided input to the  United Nations  Convention on Biological Diversity, ECAST began developing its pTA method for a project with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Asteroid Initiative. One of the two objectives of this project was to “develop and apply a participatory technology assessment that elicited nuanced information from a diverse group of citizens whose insights would not otherwise be available to decision-makers” [2]. Since then, the method has been refined through more than 25 deliberative processes.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  The objective of participant selection is not to achieve statistical representation, but rather to reflect the diversity of the community and include a plurality of voices. Participants are selected through email lists,  social  and traditional media, institutional partnering, and canvassing. Each participant receives a stipend (usually $100).  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The pTA method includes three phases of participatory activity:  1) Problem Framing: This first stage consists of open-framing  focus groups  with 15-20 selected citizens and a  stakeholder  design  workshop . The focus groups elicit citizen perspectives on an issue with minimal or no background material to limit expert issue framing. Following the focus groups, experts and stakeholders are convened for a stakeholder design workshop in which they provide input on which topic-specific questions could most benefit from citizen input, and what information citizens would need to know in order to deliberate effectively.  2) ECAST  Deliberation : Drawing on the Danish Board of Technology’s World Wide Views method, the deliberation process convenes around 100 selected citizens in each site. This stage includes a learning phase (information packet two weeks in advance, briefing materials, videos, stakeholder cards, etc.) and a deliberation phase (small groups with a facilitator, worksheets, etc.).  3) Results Integration: This last stage is the analysis of both qualitative (worksheet, notes from observers at the tables, etc.) and quantitative (pre- and post- surveys , ratings and ranking from individual worksheets) data collected during the event. After a preliminary analysis of the data, a second stakeholder workshop is convened to present preliminary deliberation results and solicit feedback on directions for deeper analysis. This process helps connect citizen input to decision-making processes.

Whether a community is grappling with a divisive issue or want to include residents' voices in city government, the Dialogue to Change process helps communities create their own space for engagement, equity, and problem solving.  Origins and Development  In 1997,  Everyday Democracy  (formerly known as the Study Circles Resource Center) noted that action was an essential component for communities to make a difference on the issues they were discussing using the  Study Circles  process. To make action an explicit component of the Study Circles process, Dialogue to Change or Dialogue to Action was adopted. [1]  Participant Recruitment and SelectionKnow how participants are recruited for this method? Help uscomplete this section!How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  At the most basic level, the Dialogue to Change process focuses on three core components: organizing, dialogue, and action to advance a deliberative and inclusive democracy. Everyday Democracy has included facilitation, evaluation, and sustaining progress as additional parts to the Dialogue to Change approach. [2]  Organizing:During the organizing phase, the emphasis is on coalition-building, recruitment of diverse dialogue participants, message development, early planning for action and training of facilitators. In this phase, it is crucial to reach out to every sector of the population to ensure that everyone's voice is heard.Facilitation:A group of well-trained facilitators is a key component to the dialogue process because facilitators ensure a quality and equitable discussion in each circle. Facilitators need to be good listeners and relate well to many different kinds of people.Dialogue:During the dialogue phase, people of varied ages, ethnicities and perspectives come together around a public concern in a space that fosters constructive, respectful conversation. Participants listen to each other's hopes and concerns, build relationships, and generate ideas for action. Typically, several groups of 8-12 participants meet over a 4-6 week period.Action:The dialogues lead to the action forum, where participants come together to share ideas. The group decides on which action ideas to move forward and action teams form to carry out the ideas.Evaluation:One of the most effective things a community can do to strengthen their dialogue to change program is to create an accurate process for documenting and evaluating the entire effort.Sustaining Progress:After a community's first round of dialogues, a community may decide to hold another round to involve more people in the community. A group could be created to help coordinate the implementation of action ideas that emerge from the dialogues. This dialogue to change process could also be institutionalized in a workplace, a local nonprofit, or within a local government.Given the impact of racism in the United States, Everyday Democracy's Dialogue to Change process pays special attention to how structural racism and other inequities affect the issues a community is addressing.

Workers are non-employees and therefore typically have no rights to minimum wage, overtime, compensation for injuries, protection from discrimination, nor compensation pay. These workers also do not have protection through joining unions nor do they have co-workers per se to whom they can talk and discuss issues [2]. Furthermore, although workers are considered independent contractors they often lack the freedom that comes with that distinction: They are unable to set their own rates or working methods and are sometimes even limited to when they are allowed to work depending on demand [3]. Yet, despite the drawbacks to becoming a gig-economy/on-demand worker, companies that employ independent contractors continue to expand. From 2012 to 2015, for example, the number of Uber drivers doubled every six months [4]. Given these growth opportunities, some workers have managed to capitalize on the popularity of on-demand work and app-based technology while preserving worker’s rights to fair compensation and job security. These include the worker-owners of Up &amp; Go; a platform cooperative.  Up &amp; Go is an online platform which brings together several cooperatively owned cleaning businesses for fair work conditions and liveable wages in a sector usually characterized by informal, precarious, and low-paid work. It is a sharing economy platform owned by its workers.  Origins and Development  The origins of Up &amp; Go start with the Center for Family Life in Sunset Park (CFLSP), New York in 2006. CFLSP began by helping local businesses organize themselves into cooperatives [5]. Cirenia Dominguez set up her own cleaning cooperative, Brightly Cleaning, in early 2017 with assistance from La Colmena community job center and CFLSP. Then in May 2017, Brightly Cleaning and two other female-owned cooperative cleaning businesses, Cooperative Cleaning of New York and Ecomundo Cleaning Worker Cooperative, came together to form Up &amp; Go, an online booking service for cleaners, using similar systems to other sharing economy platforms [6]. However, Up &amp; Go is different from other gig-economy set ups in that the people who provide the service, i.e. clean the houses, are also the people who own the platform and the businesses, cutting out extortive middle managers. Today, four different majority-women and minority-owned cleaning cooperatives contribute to Up &amp; Go: Brightly Cleaning Port Richmond, Brightly Cleaning Carroll Gardens, Brightly Cleaning East Harlem and Apple Eco Cleaning Co-op  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Participants are both the workers and business owners of Up &amp; Go, and the customers using the service.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  With funding and support from the Robin Hood Foundation, Barclays and the CFLSP, the Up &amp; Go website was developed by CoLab Cooperative with guidance from Cornell Tech. The website aimed to take advantage of what gig-economy apps offer: a digital presence, online payments and easy scheduling tools. The website functions to match customers (individuals who want their home cleaned) to service providers (cleaners) based on the needs of the customer and the capacity of the worker. First time customers specify preferred time and date of service, the size of their home, whether they have pets, whether they will provide their own cleaning products and appliances, and any other customized instructions, such as fridge cleaning or laundry. Worker owners of Up &amp; Go then receive this information as well as an estimated payment before they accept or decline a job [7].  Up &amp; Go IP rights (the platform) and brand are co-owned and managed by its workers. Profits derived from the services remain with the workers: 95 per cent of the cleaning fee is given to the worker who performed the job and only 5 per cent goes to maintaining the platform [8]. Not only do workers maintain the bulk of Up &amp; Go’s profits, they also collectively negotiate and decide pricing for the entire business [9]. One worker stated that ‘the worker-owner arrangement has given her and her colleagues more control over the business and more equity in the operation’ [10]. While the website helps the cooperatives attract and maintain new business, the platform also functions to bring members of different cooperatives together to exchange ideas, knowledge and learning [11]. Up &amp; Go holds monthly meetings for its worker owners where they can discuss any issues [12]. Through the platform cooperative, worker-owners vote on major decisions, such as cancellation policies and pricing [13, 14]. Up &amp; Go maintains collaboration and cooperation at its center. Unlike other service apps, customers cannot rate individual workers. They can still leave comments, but no individual is singled out.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Nationally, home care workers and cleaners are some of the lowest paid workers, but in 2017, Up &amp;Go workers received an average of US$22.25 per hour compared to a New York City average of US$17.27 and earned US$4-5 more per hour than an average cleaner working in the same area [15]. In addition, Up &amp; Go allows workers to compete competitively with large businesses. The general manager of Cooperative Cleaning of New York, Mariana Ortega, said ‘We can’t compete, not individually, and Up &amp; Go brings us all to that ability and level to do that. It’s a stepping-stone’ [16]. Furthermore, workers are better informed of their rights and can avoid exploitative work environments [17]. Also, in 2019, the CFLSP was the Financial Inclusion Regional Winner of the MIT Inclusive Innovation Challenge [18]. However, platform cooperatives like Up &amp; Go are not without their challenges as investors are reluctant or unwilling to lend money to a business that won’t be sold on for a profit.

It has grown considerably in the past ten years, and alongside this growth a number of challenges have become apparent, such as funds making false claims about the benefits of their investments, and those involved in invested projects about no say about the investment process itself [1].  Participatory Impact Investing offers a potential solution to these challenges, through involving communities from invested projects in the investment process, thus shifting power from the hands of investors and funds by themselves.  Origins and Development  Participant Recruitment and Selection  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Participatory Impact Investing is an overall approach rather than a specific one. This means it may utilize a number of tools and techniques depending on context. For example, the  Buen Vivir Fund  used a collaborative design process to design the structure and processes of how the fund runs. Ten grass-roots organizations worked with investors to design a structure for the fund and those grass-roots organizations are also central to the fund's governance and day-to-day running.  Peter O'Flynn and Grace Higdon suggest that impact investing should draw methodological inspiration from the global development field, where participatory methods have been central for a number of years. They suggest approaches such as  Participatory Action Research  and  Participatory Learning and Action  can be applied to investment processes to foster deep reflection and learning over more superficial forms of engagement [2].

However, directimpacts can be difficult to track.As a participatory group process, Ripple Effect Mapping invites program participants to reflect, visually map, and assess intended and unintendedchanges orimpactsof the program.Through REM, participants can tell their story ofimpact throughidentifying the ripple effects of a community intervention.  Origins and Development  REM was developed throughthe merging oftwo separate evaluation efforts: the Community CapitalsFramework(CCF) and the HorizonsProgram.The Community Capitals Frameworkevaluationuses seven indicatorstoanalyzea “community ecosystem.”[2] The seven""capitals""in a communityarenatural, cultural, human, social, political,financial, and built.Mapping CCF wasfirstapplied to tracking how “using assets in one capitalcould build assets in others.” [3]  REM also emerged from the evaluation work of the Horizons Program, an 18-monthcommunity centered initiative to reduce poverty. The Horizon Program asked participants from various Horizon communities to share their individual stories, which were then coded with the CCF.Bothefforts convergedto createa powerful participatory data collection method that is now known as REM.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  REM involves recruiting8-12orup to amaximumof20 program participants, representing a broad spectrum of stakeholders, who can speak to the positive and negative effects they have observed and/or experienced as individuals within and across organizations,institutions, and in the community.Two co-facilitators are assigned for the ripple  mapping  session: one to facilitate and one to keep time and take notes.[4]  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Ripple Effect Mapping consistsof four “core ingredients”: Appreciative Inquiry, Participatory Approach, Interactive Group Interviewing and Reflection, andRadiantThinking (Mind Mapping).[5] These four elements can be adapted to variousevaluative contexts.Below is a brief description of what the four “core ingredients” are in REM.Appreciative Inquiry:The AIprocesscreates“generative energy” and “critical, even negative reflections”when participants interview one another in pairs or in small groups. Prepared questions explore “peak experiences, successes or achievements,” “deepened or new relationships,” and “unexpected or surprising developments” from the community program or initiative guide the AI process. [6]The AI process is usually done in the beginning of a REM session.Participatory Approach:In a Participatory Approach, program stakeholders shift from being “recipients of evaluative information” to active participants in the evaluation process. [7] REM enables community  stakeholders toinfluence the decision making process from “how the AI questions arewritten, who is invited to the session, how and to whom participants are paired for peer-to–peer interviews” to identifying “what themes are prioritized from the data.” [8]Interactive Group Interviewing and Reflection:Interactive group interviewing and reflection helps REM participants “generate new knowledge regarding the kind and extent of program impact.” [9]During REM, there are two stages of group interaction and reflection, the first being peer-to-peer interviews and then sharing the interview responses in the group. The second stage is a group reflection, which is facilitator-led.RadiantThinking(Mind Mapping):Radiant Thinking refers to the “brain’s associative thought processes that derive from a central point and forms links between integrated concepts.” [10] Mind Mapping visually captures the connections among the ideas or “the chain of effects” resulting from a program.” [11] It usually begins during the reporting out section of the AI process. Mind mapping software or a large piece of paper, markers or sticky notes can be used to document the ideas and connections that participants identify.  Ripple Effect Mappinghas three distinct approaches: web-mapping, in-depth rippling, and theming and rippling.In general, these three approaches involve three steps: Appreciative Inquiry (AI), Mapping Impacts, and Reflection and Closing.Appreciative Inquiry:Participantscan be paired up or in small groups. Each participant takes a turn answering the AI questions andsharing storiesabout various actions and impacts relatedto the community engagement program.The “listener” encourages the storyteller to provide as much detail as possible and probes for examples of how this change happened,especially notingkey enabling factors. A few people are asked to share their stories or having a group report-out transitionsthe group into the mapping process.MappingImpacts:A large sheet of paper, a whiteboard, or software is used for the mapping process.The project name or a topic(if using the web-mapping approach)is written into the center.Depending on what approach istaken,participants thenwrite out what they shareddirectlyonto the paperor with sticky notes.For example,in the in-depth rippling approach, participantstake turns sharing their storiesand ripple out the story using a differentmarker color for each ripple.[12] With the web-mapping approach, the first ripple answers the question “What are people doing differently” and the second and third ripples answerquestions of expanding impact or changes.[13] In the theming and rippling approach,participants are asked to share how the community project or effort impacted the participant, community,and beyond.[14] Probing for detailed responsesorforchanges at all levels — individual, organizational, institutional— is critical to exploring as many connections and outcomes as possible during mapping.Reflection:Participants reflect on the map and what they have learned from participating in the ripple mapping process.Reflection questions could include examining the most significant changes or impacts on the map, sharing new learnings that the participantsgained, and/ornoting possible next steps for theparticipantsto undertake.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  REM is an emerging,promisingevaluative method for capturing impacts and changes in community engagement efforts.This method could deliver on some orallthe following:Visualizing, connecting, and assessingintended or unintendedoutcomes, changes, or impactstoa community program, intervention, or initiative.[15] REM is a method that can “celebrate current activities”and“evaluate pastwork”to provide insight for possible next steps.[16] The data captured in REM could be informative not only for participating stakeholders but also for funders.  Participatory evaluative method:Participants can be involved with the design, evaluation, and analysis of REM sessions. Evaluators and participants leave with a “better sense of its accomplishments and a renewed vision for the future.” [17] Collaboration between the evaluatorand participantsempowers participants to feel “vital rather than feeling like they just had something done or extracted from them.” [18]Analysis and Lessons Learned  REM isaflexibleand adaptablemethod that can beutilized “across multiple settings and with various types of participants to document intended and unintended effects of a program, project, community, coalition and/or system.”[19]It is a relativelylow-costevaluative method and could lower participatorybarrierssuch as“age, literacy level, and/or language barriers.”[20] One consideration to note is deciding when to do a REM session. Allowing more time to pass after a community initiative could result in identifying more impacts. However, it could also lead to fading memory or losing contact with the original participants.

Without proactive involvement and empowerment of local communities, projects led by external agencies have the potential to fail [1].  In response, Spark developed their six phase process for funding and maintaining development projects. The aims of this approach are to ensure that projects are driven by communities and their participation, and that projects are sustainable in the long-term, beyond Spark's involvement.  Origins and DevelopmentKnow how and why this method was developed? Help uscomplete this section!Participant Recruitment and Selection  Spark processes have taken place in  Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo and Ghana . The projects take place at the village level.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The Spark process fits into the broader approach of community driven development. These approaches ensure that active collaboration with and participation of communities is at the core of proposed development projects. This is in contrast to traditional Western development approaches where outside organizations come into a community and implement a project without community involvement, resulting in ineffective interventions that do not empower or help affected communities [2]  The Spark Approach involves  six phases  taking place over two years:Community building: designed to identify expectations between Spark and the community, and begin developing a community vision  Goal setting: identifying and prioritizing objectives and researching how to meet them  Proposal development: developing a concrete proposal including operations and logistics  Technical advisor: an external expert works with communities to review the proposal and support them to strengthen it  Implementation: communities receive the Spark Microgrant and begin implementing their proposal  Future envisioning: communities consider the future of the project beyond the grant and build local networksFacilitation is a central feature of the Spark approach. A local (to the project) university graduate is employed as a facilitator to guide conversations with the community. This person is involved with facilitating and assisting the community to implement the process over the two years [3].  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Spark cites a range of impacts achieved from its initiatives:50/50 gender balance in community participation  44% elected leaders are women  6/10 communities go on to launch a second project independent from the original Spark process  85% communities continue to meet independently after the Spark process ends  86% projects sustained independently after the two years [4]Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this method?

The process allows residents to record their views on various issues, work together to identify priorities, and in collaboration with local authorities and agencies, continue to develop an action plan for change.[1]  Origins and Development  Planning for Real® is inspired by the principles of active commitment to the community. This method was devised in the 1970s at the University of Nottingham by a team headed by British researcher Tony Gibson; it was therefore first adopted in a Glasgow neighborhood and, starting in 1988, it was further developed under the aegis of the Neighborhood Initiatives Foundation. [2] Currently its application is recognized by the British state at the national level and is managed by the homonymous organization Planning for Real, of the Accord group. Its headquarters are Bilston West Midlands.[1]  Participation Recruitment and Selection  This method is open to all, to a potentially unlimited number.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The process is divided into eight phases and lasts for several weeks, according to the following scheme:Initiative: a group of citizens meet and communicate that they want to make changes in the area where they live. It therefore invites all those who are equally interested in the topic to participate. Wishes and ideas on how to transform the area are collected and exchanged.  Construction of the model: to illustrate what needs to be changed and what can be changed, with material that is easy to manipulate, the townspeople build a three-dimensional model that represents the status quo of the area. In this phase, working together, the participants get to know each other, exchange ideas and focus on the area covered by the process.  Presentation of the model: the model is displayed in the neighborhood in various locations and occasions in order to reach the greatest possible number of people who live or work there. The goal is to refine the model by collecting the ideas of other towns and other citizens.  “Who can do what?”: With the so-called neighborhood skills registration sheets, a sort of inventory of the resources and skills present in the area is made.  Public event: the residents affix the so-called stickers on the model showing the hypotheses of transformation of the area. This indicates the areas where you want to make changes. Experts and experts participate in this phase to provide technical advice, where needed.  Definition of priorities: on the basis of the model and the proposals put forward, priorities are set and working groups are formed.  Elaboration of the themes: the working groups elaborate the topic they have chosen and produce the related action plan.  Implementation of action plans: in the last phase, the action plans are implemented, possibly in a short time. This happens - as far as possible - with the participation of the citizens who took part in the process. Further achievements depend on the agreements that were made with the clients of the process before its start.

In a praiseworthy survey, it is a priority to positively evaluate what has worked well up to that point (for example, in an organization, company, neighbourhood or region). Consequently, it should be possible to identify the reasons behind this success or a missed disaster / collapse. The Appreciative Inquiry has more the character of a philosophy than that of a well-defined participatory method. The practical application (modality and conduct of the event, number, recruitment system, and composition of the group of participants) is very variable. [1]  Origins and Development  This method was developed in the 1980s by Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland, Ohio, USA) to manage change. It has been used for quite some time in the US, Australia, and Europe (particularly in the UK, the Netherlands and Belgium), but is also expanding into German-speaking countries. [2]  Participant Recruitment and Selection  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  As a rule, an AI comprises four phases:Understanding the reasons for success: Participants are asked to tell about their personal experiences in relation to the topic, to point out any circumstances underlying the success, and to discuss it with others.  Developing future perspectives: starting from the collected success stories, prospects for future development are elaborated. It examines how the positive experiences could be extended to other sectors.  Structuring the future: how to concretely proceed in the future is discussed.  Realizing the future: Finally, concrete strategies for implementation are developed.Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Analysis and Lessons Learned  See Also  References  [1]  Nanz P., Fritsche M.,  La partecipazione dei cittadini: un manuale.

Often referred to as a research methodology, action research is more accurately described as an “orientation to enquiry”. [1] Most concretely, action research arises when people of different backgrounds – citizens, migrants, academics, NGO workers, government officials, etc. – come together to address problems facing their communities. These problems can be big or small, easy to solve or complex, and can require short-term or multi-year commitments. All action research, however, is participatory and community-based. What this means in practice, is up for debate.  Indeed, although action research is community-based, it can be carried out with different degrees of community involvement. Action research can therefore be said to exist on a spectrum, with community-driven projects on one side and investigator-driven projects on the other.  Hacker usefully outlines these differences through the following image [2]:Projects with high levels of community involvement are referred to by Hacker (2017) as “community-driven”. To many scholars and activists, research must be community-driven in order to effect sustainable social change. Community-driven action research emerges from “the street,” and therefore in response to problems facing local communities through discussions in spaces like local markets, mosques and churches, living rooms or community centres. It therefore grows out of collaborative, grassroots efforts to solve problems in local communities. Community members decide to collaborate with academics and practitioners trained in action research when they lack the resources or expertise to understand and tackle these problems alone.  Action research projects with lower levels of community involvement are referred to as “investigator-driven”. Academics or practitioners initiate investigator-driven projects for a variety of reasons. For example, they may believe that in order to get a more nuanced and holistic understanding of the problem they work on, it is better to work collaboratively with the community the problem affects. However, they may not have the time, resources, or relationships necessary to involve community members from the beginning. They may also find that community members lack the capacity, resources, or time to remain substantively involved throughout the project. Nonetheless, like practitioners and academics involved in community-driven projects, they remain committed to ensuring their findings are useful to people, encourage social action, and therefore have an impact beyond their immediate professional worlds.  In practice, action research often falls somewhere in the middle of these two poles. Furthermore, action research projects are not static, and can therefore change in structure over time. For example, as community members make new demands, new resources become available, or trust and rapport is built, investigator-driven projects may become community-driven, while community-driven projects can also become more investigator-driven as the commitments of community members wane or as new demands are placed on their schedules. Overall, however, as an emerging body of research asserts, which is explored in detail below, it is important to maintain high levels of community involvement throughout action research projects in order to make a tangible, lasting impact, and therefore promote human flourishing and social change.  As an orientation toward knowledge production, therefore, action research challenges how research is conventionally approached. All action research is participatory and community-based. Action researchers put forward distinct understandings of who holds knowledge, how it should be generated, and how it should be used, which together challenge the way conventional research is done. As Bradbury and Reason put it, “[a]ction research challenges much received wisdom in both academia and among social change and development practitioners, not least because it is a practice of participation, engaging those who might otherwise be subjects of research or recipients of interventions to a greater or less extent as inquiring co-researchers”.[1] The primary purpose of action research, therefore, is to produce practical knowledge that can be useful to people, allowing them to live better lives.  Therefore, as Bradbury and Reason [3] summarize, action research:“is a set of practices that responds to people’s desire to act creatively in the face of practical and often pressing issues in their lives in organizations and communities;  calls for engagement with people in collaborative relationships, opening new ‘communicative spaces’ in which dialogue and development can flourish;  draws on many ways of knowing, both in the evidence that is generated in inquiry and its expression in diverse forms of presentation as we share learning with wider audiences;  is values oriented, seeking to address issues of significance concerning the flourishing of human persons, their communities, and the wider ecology in which we participate;  is a living, emergent process that cannot be pre-determined but changes and develops as those engaged deepen their understanding of the issues to be addressed and develop their capacity as co-inquirers both individually and collectively.”Origins and Development  Action research encompasses a wide range of approaches to social action, so researchers disagree over how it should be practiced, by whom, and to what end. This section identifies a number of distinct approaches within the category of action research, each of which has its own intellectual and/or theoretical influences. It also considers what connects these approaches together as forms of action research, despite their differences.  The origins of action research begin with the work of Kurt Lewin. Two more recent iterations of action research are participatory action research (PAR) and  community based participatory research  (CBPR). Each of these approaches builds on, but also challenges, the work of Lewin. Participatory action research (PAR) originates in the anthropological work of Marja-Liisa Swantz, then developing from the work of Swantz to Latin America, where it was most famously elaborated by Paolo Freire and Orlando Fals Borda. Although CBPR offers some innovations on previous approaches, it shares many similarities with PAR. By following the development action research over time, one can see that, at their core, PAR and CBPR should be considered forms of action research through their commitments to participation, community, and social change.Kurt LewinMost scholars trace the origins of action research to the work of Kurt Lewin.[4] In the 1930s, Lewin undertook a series of experimental research projects in factories across the United States. Lewin’s research challenged the theory of scientific management, put forward by Fred W. Taylor. At the time, scientific management prevailed as the theory of management in most factories, emphasizing top-down decision-making structures that prioritized efficiency. Lewin’s goal was to demonstrate that, within factories but also neighbourhood settings, productivity and social gains were more likely to be produced through democratic participation rather than scientific management, which he considered to be a form of autocratic coercion. Working alongside “minority groups” Lewin sought to enhance their independence, equality, and co-operation. Lewin promoted these goals mainly through discussion-based groups. This is illustrated well by his work at one factory. As Adelman describes [5]:  “The first group received direct training given didactically with little opportunity to raise questions. The second group was encouraged to discuss and decide on the division of tasks and comment on the training that was given. Over several months the productivity of the second group was consistently higher than that of the first. The staff of the second group learnt the tasks faster and their morale remained high, whereas in the first group morale remained low”.  Lewin therefore lent credence, and power, to reflective thought, discussion, and action, affording them capacity to challenge and overcome local problems.  A central critique levelled at Lewin’s work, however, was that the group-based gains his research resulted in rarely led to structural change. As Adelman writes, “[a]lthough power relations became more equitable in the workplace this reconstructionist research made little difference to the ownership of capital.""[9] As she goes on to say, although Lewin did important work on “participatory democratic workplaces” the “institutionalisation of these relationships has only been possible in parts of nations where wealth is more evenly distributed”.[6] At the same time, one must also consider the degree to which the structural change desired by researchers is reflected in the desires of participants themselves.Participatory Action ResearchParticipatory action research emerged in the 1970s as a riposte to how action research had been institutionalized across much of the developed and developing world. Participatory action research has been defined thusly by Mandakini Pant in the Encyclopedia of Action Research[7]:  “Participatory Action Research (PAR) can be conceptualized as a process of research, education and action in which participants transform reality and transform themselves. Unlike traditional, expert-model, top-down approaches to research, PAR gives community members a central role in the research process. This includes participation in the identification of the problem, the formulation of research questions, the collection, analysis and interpretation of data, the formulation and communication of conclusions and the implementation of an action plan”  The origins of PAR are pinpointed in the work of the Finish anthropologist, Marja-Liisa Swantz. This is important, as her contribution to PAR is ignored in many accounts of its history. In Latin America, the work of Orlando Fals Borda and Paolo Freire on PAR developed their own community-based orientations toward social action, but also built on the ideas proposed by Lewin, Swantz and others in order to challenge the structural inequalities that faced their region and the communities with which they worked.Marja-Liisa SwantzSwantz coined the term Participatory Action Research during her work in Tanzania in the 1970s, when she worked as a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Dar es Salaam.Specifically, PAR emerged from an income-generating project involving youth from five coastal villages in the country.[8] The project involved the youth at every stage of the project, allowing them to select the activities to pursue in collaboration with the researchers, who were students of Swantz’s. In the end, they decided on gardening, carpentry and fishing projects.  As one of the of the students reported about the project,  ""Colleague, Ruth Besha and I have come to realise that this was a unique programme. While the traditional research methods take the people as objects of research, ours took them as actors, in fact as the stars of the whole process. This was a revolution in itself. Despite the problems, the method whereby researchers stay and work together with the local people is the best one, as besides bringing youth of different educational levels together, it also gives the local people opportunities for learning from the researchers. ... At the same time we learned a lot from the local people. People talk freely with people with whom they are acquainted"". [9]  In her reflections on PAR, the term she used to describe the work done by her students and herself during her time in Tanzania, Swantz emphasized the practical, phenomenological, and hermeneutic origins of PAR.[9] For her, PAR emerged as a local, collaborative response to specific, community-based problems. Above anything else, PAR required participants to identify communicatively with one another through this process. As she later wrote about these origins, “I identify my own approach as being hermeneutic and phenomenological, critical of my person in relation to partners and seeing that I have a role in bringing into people’s consciousness connecting factors for their own analysis.”[10] Swantz therefore pushed back against other, more ideologically-driven approaches to PAR, especially those rooted in Marxism.Paolo FreirePerhaps the prominent scholar involved in the development of PAR, Freire’s formative years were spent working for the University of Recife’s Cultural Extension Service, through which he introduced literacy programs to poor communities around Brazil.[11] Freire worked under conditions of intense inequality, political violence, and exploitation, and was committed to dismantling the structures that helped create these conditions. During his work for the Cultural Extension Service, Freire approached literacy differently to most program managers. He started his literacy programs by teaching basic words, but also asked participants to reflect critically on the political conditions they lived in.  Central to Freire’s work was the notion of conscientizaçao,  a form of literacy that challenged the manner in which education was conventionally pursued, as well as the structural conditions of education’s making. Freire defined conscientizaçao as a form of “learning to perceive social, political, and economic contradictions, and take action against the oppressive elements of reality.”[12] He therefore eschewed dominant approaches to literacy programming, instead focusing on training peasants to recognize the roots of their oppression. For Freire, knowledge was power. By doing research with oppressed communities, therefore, Freire tried to change how they looked at the world.Orlando Fals BordaA contemporary of Freire, encountered his ideas several times. A Colombian researcher, sociologist and activist, Fals Borda read Pedagogy of the Oppressed  through Latin American activist networks he participated in.[13] Fals Borda helped found the School of Sociology and was one of the first scholars to systematically study violence in his country. His first statement on the approach that would later come to be referred to as Participatory Action Research can be found in a 1972 book, Causa popular, ciencia popular . As Lomeli and Rappaport note, the book was published by La Rosca de Investigación y Acción Social. La Rosca, which means in-group, was organizationally focused on “militant” research.[14]  At first, PAR was historically-oriented. Fals Borda wanted scholars and the people they collaborated with to pay “special attention to those elements or institutions that have been useful in the past to confront the enemies of the exploited classes.”[14] Through historically-oriented study, researchers and community members could collaboratively work to change existing socioeconomic conditions. As he wrote, “once those elements are determined, they are reactivated with the aim of using them in a similar manner in current class struggles”[14]  As with Freire, Borda wrote in the context of growing inequality, intensification of capitalist growth, the spectre of American encroachment into the region, and the success of the Cuban Revolution. In this context, scholars, communities and activists collaborated to craft approaches to social action that combined knowledge production with activism and therefore political change. For all of them, research was about reclaiming knowledge lost, dispossessed, or ignored by those in power. Borda, Freire and Swantz, although working on similar projects, did not meet until the late 1970s. It was here, alongside Budd Hall, at the Conference on Participatory Action Research where they most clearly articulated their vision of PAR.Community-Based Participatory ResearchCBPR shares many similarities with PAR. Theoretically and in practice, it largely emerged through the work of North American-based scholars in psychology and health, such as Karen Hacker, Barbara Israel, Michelle Fine, and Nina Wallerstein, and organizations like the Centre for Participatory Research and the Wellsley Institute.  To advocates of CBPR, their projects fall to the right side of the spectrum discussed above, and can thus be described as community-driven research projects with high levels of community involvement. The projects often begin when citizens are facing a complex social issue — such as poor health outcomes in a neighbourhood — but lack the capacity, knowledge or networks to fully understand or positively impact it.  Community based participatory researchers therefore carry forward several key principles outlined above. First, CBPR is initiated to address the needs and interests of the community, rather than the researcher or government department. Some CBPR scholars, however, are critical of other approaches to action research, such as PAR, through which they contend the source of problems is ideologically pre-determined. As with other approaches to action research, however, CBPR develops the capacity of the community members it involves, as well as their understanding of the problem that confronts them. Community members are “empowered” as they participate, gaining knowledge that spurs action. CBPR also transforms historically “expert” dominated spaces, like academia and government ministries, by introducing novels insights from the communities it's conducted in. This transformation is critical to CBPR researchers, who work with academic or government spaces to better equip them to respond to the challenges facing communities, but in a context specific manner. Every CBPR project, therefore, is open-ended and flexible, and responds to a series of unique social conditions. Consequently, there is no “blueprint” or “model” for communities, researchers, or government officials interested in CBPR to follow.  One of the most prominent contemporary proponents of CBPR, Barbara Israel, articulates 9 principles that, together, help distinguish CBPR from other approaches to research:Recognizes community as a unit of identity.  Begins with and builds on strengths and resources within the community.  Facilitates collaborative, equitable partnership in all phases of the research, involving an empowering and power sharing process.  Promotes co-learning and capacity building among all partners involved.  Integrates and creates a balance between knowledge generation and action for mutual benefit of all partners.  Emphasis on local relevance of public health and social problems and ecological approaches that address the multiple determinants of disease and well-being.  Involves systems development through a cyclical and iterative process.  Disseminates findings to all partners and involves all partners in the dissemination process.  Involves a long-term process and commitment [15]Many differences, therefore, separate Kurt Lewin’s approach to action research from later iterations proposed in the works of Lewin, Fals Borda, and CBPR researchers. Over time, new approaches to action research have focused more explicitly on the structural roots of inequality, such as through PAR, and have become more community-owned, through CBPR. Nonetheless, PAR and CBPR fall under the rubric of action research and are therefore considered to be of the same “genre”.[16] This is perhaps most definitively summarized by Holkup et al (2004), whose argument is worth quoting in full. As they note, each of the approaches discussed above should be considered a form of action research because:  “They all emanate from the same ontological paradigm, one embracing a participative reality.They rely on an epistemology of experiential and participative knowing, informed by critical subjectivity and participatory transaction. All link action with research, and all recognize the importance of involving members of the study population in the research process. Additionally, knowledge gained from participatory approaches to research continues to increase understanding of what it means to work within the subjective spaces created when people from diverse cultures collaborate to work toward a common goal” [16]  Participant Recruitment and Selection  How one approaches participant recruitment and selection will depend on a variety of factors, especially the degree of community involvement in a project, and will require the organizers to ask a range of questions.  For example, when action research is community-driven, many of the participants may already be recruited through an existing community network. Therefore, the main questions revolve around the composition of the network, as well as how to add new collaborators who can advance the work. Community-driven action research also often requires recruiting other collaborators, especially if organizers lack training in action research. Here the involvement of academics and practitioners can be especially useful. When a project is investigator-driven, recruitment is often a much larger undertaking, requiring outreach with communities one may not have links to.Kubicek and Robles have put together a series of questions to consider:""Is your participant recruitment goal realistic for the persons, population, and region with whom/in which you are conducting your study?  Is your recruitment approach tailored to the interests and priorities of the target person/population?  Is your study timeline realistic for the number of participants you plan to recruit?  Are you allocating time and money towards better understanding and developing the necessary partnerships to gain the trust of that population before you begin recruitment?  Have you developed an alternative plan for recruitment in case your first plan does not succeed?"" [17]When approaching recruitment at the community level, there are also several practical considerations involved in participation recruitment and selection. Particularly, it is important to consider how the backgrounds of prospective participants should shape the recruitment approach. Indeed, it is important to consider how the age, language, cultural norms, gender, socioeconomic status, legal status, condition of being studied are relevant.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  This section first considers how action research unfolds when it is investigator-driven. It then considers a more community-driven approach to action research.There is often overlap between these processes.Investigator-Driven Action ResearchFor Mertler, investigator-driven projects can be understood to unfold over four stages: planning; acting; developing; and reflecting.[18]Stage 1:PlanningWithin stage one, Mertler identifies four steps. It is important to note, however, that projects initiated by action researchers do not necessarily unfold according to a linear trajectory. Therefore, each step should be considered a guidepost rather than sequential series of law-like rules. This applies to all of the steps and stages described below.  Step one of this stage requires the researcher to identify and then limit their topic. A few things should be top of mind when pursuing this step. First, the researcher should select a project that will make a difference to the participants with whom they are working. As Mertler writes, “[i]t is important to remember that the goal of any action research project is a desire to make things better, improve some specific practice, or correct something that is not working as well as it should”.[19] Second, researchers should select a topic that genuinely interests them and sparks curiosity, as they will be working on the project for quite a while. Also important is selecting a manageable topic. Manageability can be thought of from several perspectives; for example, is there a timeframe within which the research needs to be completed, such as a school semester or an election? Furthermore, consider who will be participating in the project, and what level of engagement they will be capable of.  Step two is to gather baseline information for the project. This is a preliminary step that Mertler refers to as ""reconnaissance"".[18] This can involve discussing the project with stakeholders or key interlocutors, both casually as well as more formally. For example, this may involve getting a coffee with them, but also arranging a stakeholder meeting. This will help complement the next steps of reviewing academic and policy literature, and developing a research plan.  The third step is to review the related literature. There is no limit to how much time one should dedicate to this step but they ought to try to gather information from a diverse range of sources, and think about the positionality of whoever has produced the source and the biases with which this perspective will be associated. Some good resources include JStor, open access journals, census data, newspaper archives, and/or local libraries.  The final step is to develop a research plan. During this step, the insights developed in each of the previous steps are formalized and a methodology is selected. One might ask: ""what methodology should I select?"" Or alternatively, a researcher may think, ""I thought action research was  my methodology."" However, to state definitively, action research is not a methodology. It is an epistemology or a mindset. In fact, numerous research methodologies can, hypothetically, be implemented under the banner of action research, from ethnography to large scale quantitative projects. Questions ought to be asked about which is most suitable. For example, are you running your project in a particular discipline? What types of skills do your participants need to develop? What are they capable of? What does your ethics approval allow for? Therefore, think about the methodology that is best suited to the study area, and do research on how to make it participatory, community-based, and useful to participants.Stage 2:ActingThis stage requires the researcher to act on the plan they developed in stage 1. It involves two steps. The first step — step 5 — is implementing the plan and collecting data. No matter what method is used, it is critical to record as much information as possible by keeping detailed field notes. One can collect data through participant observation (by conducting interviews or distributing  questionnaires ), or by reviewing existing documents and quantitative data.  Step 6 requires the researcher, as well as participants, if they are willing, to analyze the data. Analyze them by looking for themes, categories, or patterns that emerge. This analysis will influence further data collection by revealing what to look for while moving forward. Therefore, analysis is an iterative and open-ended process. This helps to create feedback loops. As new insights emerge, the research focus may shift.Stage 3:DevelopingStep 7, developing an action plan, is the heart of any action research project. The most important outcome from this action plan is the creation of a specific and tangible outline of how the ideas collected can contribute to understanding, and solving, the problem that the researcher set out to address. To learn more about the practicalities of developing an action plan, please turn to Mertler's (2019) discussion.  In step 8, the group moves to communicating and reporting results. The most important consideration here is to have several outputs for different audiences. For example, policymakers, academics, and community members may look for different types of information when engaging with, and acting on, the research. Of course, at points these categories can break down. Community members may themselves be academics, or especially inclined toward highly technical reporting. However, researchers should try to think generally about the audience their work is connecting with, and what distinguishes them from other groups. In this step, there is significant license for creativity. Although action research can be disseminated through reports or newspaper articles, more heterodox forms, like performances, such as theatre, can be also be incredibly effective.Stage 4:ReflectingThis is the final stage. Here, researchers reflect on their action research process, involving as many people as possible. Stakeholders are people who participate in, but also who were affected by, the project. Gathering reflections can be a great way to consider the impact. Because many action research projects are iterative, reflections may also feed into other action research projects run by others interested in tackling similar challenges.Community-Driven Action ResearchAction research that is community-driven has been described by Hacker as a three-stage process,[2] which are elaborated on below, building on Hacker's insights.Stage 1: Defining the community, engaging the community, community needs assessment, identifying the research questionAs Hacker notes, depending on how a project is conceived, each step in every stage will manifest differently.Therefore, as with the process described above, the below should not be taken as a blueprint for action, but rather a series of guideposts to direct a research project.  The first step of stage one is to define the community one is working with. How a “community” is defined will change markedly depending on the terms of engagement. And with community-driven research, the community often defines itself through its own participatory processes. Broadly, however, communities can be defined by geography, by condition, or by other common characteristics. In an example cited by Hacker, for example, the community engaged through action research was a group of immigrants.[2] But a panoply of possibilities exists. For example, one could work with people living with disabilities, or grandmothers, or with a diverse range of backgrounds from a particular location. At a certain point, however, decisions need to be made as to when the community is bounded, and whether the process should be open to new participants.  Once the community has been defined, engage the community members to understand their needs. Engagement here requires formal meetings in both group and one-on-one scenarios, but this process also benefits immensely from less formal modes of engagement. For example, planning and attending community events can build trust. Indeed, the more rapport one has with other community members, the more nuanced and comprehensive one’s understanding of needs can potentially be.  After defining the community and engaging with them for a sustained period of time, it is important to conduct a formal needs-based assessment. This can be done using insights from the community as well as existing data and literature. Here, it is helpful to standardize a form and a set of questions to ensure consistency in response. Consulting existing databases and literature can also be useful as these sources may afford a more complete picture of prevailing needs in the community one works with and in. It can also be important to raise awareness around accessing these sources, build capacity, or find ways to ensure sustainable access to knowledge. This way, the community can stay informed once the researcher leaves the community. Furthermore, as Hacker notes, researchers may discover new sources of information through their engagement with community members.[2]  The final step in Stage 1 is to identify a research question. This is one of the most important steps in any action research process. It is imperative to work with everyone when identifying a question. In many cases, communities may frame their question(s) in general terms. For example, “why are crime rates high in our community?” The training and experience of researchers and practitioners can assist in sharpening the focus of these more general questions. For this example, the question may transform into, “What role do stop and frisk policies play in shaping the reporting on crime rates in our community? Therefore, it is important to make the question specific, to make it manageable for",1,0,0,0,0,

The guide should not be seen as just an exercise to deal with specific issues. It is an instrument meant to promote a shared discovery among citizens about their power to effectively deal with public issues. Of course, every community is different, and every moderator is different so this instrument is designed to be adapted to a moderator's strengths and situation.  Origins and Development  With an eye to the importance of civic learning and professionalization of challenges that were once seen as the purview of citizens and civic associations, Kettering’s workgroup convened an exchange with a group of organizations whose work supports community‐based initiators of experiments in public engagement, calling the project  Citizens at Work: Engaging for Prosperous Communities .  The group produced two important work products: 1) a question-based instrument that may be used by community innovators to engage citizens in addressing important community concerns, and 2) a list of key insights based on the group’s collective experiences in engaging citizens (included as a component of the question-based instrument).  How It Works  Preparing to ConveneThink about the pressing issues facing the community. What issues are citizens already talking about? What topics would motivate them to get involved? What issues are community leaders struggling with? What makes it difficult for leaders or institutions in the community to solve these issues on their own? What issues facing the community would most benefit from citizen involvement?  After you determine the broad topic to be addressed (e.g., education, economic development, health care, etc.), you need to decide who should be invited to deliberate. Think about the people or organizations in the community that may be interested in, or affected by, this issue. Where are people talking about this issue? Who is already working on this issue? Who has been involved in the past? Who hasn't been involved, but has a voice we need to hear?  Identify a core group of 15-20 people whose experience cuts across the whole community, who listen and talk thoughtfully, and who have others’ respect.  Think about including a variety of perspectives relevant to the topic, such as business, government, and non-profit representatives as well as diversity in terms of gender, age, race/ethnicity and income. If this is an issue that could benefit from regional action, you might think about including some participants from adjoining communities as well.  Talk to those on the list to make sure they will commit to participating in a series of meetings (every couple of weeks for 2-3 hours). Once you have a core group committed to working on the issue, if space and resources allow, widely publicize the meetings in order to open them to anyone interested in the issue.  The number of meetings may vary, but you should plan for at least three sessions: one meeting to identify the key issue (What is the problem?), a second session to identify and discuss possible solutions (If that is the problem, what are the ways to deal with it?), and a third meeting to identify action steps (How can we take action to address the problem?). After the third session (or before if you think the time is right), have the group reflect upon the deliberative process they have experienced using “Questions about Community Questions.” Ideally, the group will choose to continue to meet to work together around this issue – and to address other community concerns.  Prepare in advance for any tensions that might exist between groups involved in the issue. Look for opportunities to ease these tensions and build communication between the groups. Do any of the individuals or groups that are interested in or working on this issue already work together? Do they regularly communicate? Are there any known conflicts between those interested in working on the issue? What is the nature of these tensions or conflicts?  Choose a moderator and someone to take notes. The moderator should be trusted and impartial, but need not be a part of the community. In the longer run, however, credible facilitators must emerge from within the community if this type of community decision-making is to be sustainable.Towards More Effective Citizen Engagement  The Kettering Foundation working group offers the following seven insights based on the group’s collective experiences in engaging citizens. As one plans, organizes and conducts community forums using Community Questions, think about these insights and suggested actions. Do they resonate with your own experience? Perhaps add your own insights. These insights might be especially useful as you help citizens reflect on the process at the conclusion of Community Questions.  Insights and InstructionsCitizens must be engaged if communities are to solve some of their most difficult problems. Such problems (e.g., youth gangs, poverty, racial conflict, crime) have multiple causes and cannot be solved with a technical fix (unlike repairing streets and bridges). Effectively addressing these problems requires citizens to act – and keep on acting. So . . . engage citizens to address community problems.  Citizens often think about problems differently than institutions or professionals. Not only do people feel more empowered when they are encouraged to identify and frame the issues related to a problem or opportunity, but they often uncover different solutions than institutions or professionals who are looking at the problem from the lens of their own particular expertise. So ... recognize the limits of professional expertise.  People become engaged only around issues or problems that are of particular interest or concern to them. It’s not realistic to assume that all citizens will be engaged in all issues. The definition of “community” is therefore dynamic and ever changing, with groups of people – who may or may not be connected by geographic borders – coming together to solve a problem or take advantage of an opportunity. So . . . start with what people care about.  Citizen engagement – and governance – is a skill learned only by practice. It’s important to create mechanisms that allow for sustained citizen engagement rather than just one-time events. As citizens gain experience and see that they can make a difference, they may be drawn into issues beyond their initial areas of interest – particularly as they begin to see how many community issues are interrelated. So . . . establish structures that sustain engagement.  It’s often most effective to engage citizens within the organizations and networks they are already a part of; we don’t have to start from scratch. It’s likely that they are already talking about a particular issue in these networks and may have the capacity and connections to implement solutions. So . . . engage existing networks.  Networks and connections between organizations can multiply the power of civic initiatives and make them truly community-wide, or “public.” Yet, these connections typically don’t happen by themselves – active intervention is often needed to connect groups that might, at first glance, seem to have very different interests. Even groups working on similar issues often have weak connections. Conveners can help communities re-define their relations, re-shape their networks, and restructure their capacity to act. So . . . connect existing networks and stakeholders.  When a group of people comes together for a community conversation, there will be tensions between goals, ideas, and values. What may at first seem to be tensions between groups may, with further examination, be seen as common values that everyone shares – such as a desire for freedom or security. Tensions and conflicts do not have to necessarily be resolved as long as everyone shows respect for diverse positions. We can agree to disagree. It’s important to recognize tensions from the beginning of a community conversation. So . . . recognize and value tensions.Community Questions: Engaging Citizens to Address Community Concerns1. What is the Problem?Moderator TipsKeep asking questions.  Keep in mind that what you originally define as “the” problem may just be a symptom of a deeper problem.  A key task is to get participants to listen carefully to others. The process cannot be completed in one meeting. So don’t rush. While participants will want to move quickly to solutions, they must first listen and understand viewpoints different than their own.More QuestionsWhat concerns you most about the (economic) state of our community?  How does this affect you / your family / your neighbors?  What are you hearing in others’ statements that differs significantly from your perspective? Can you begin to understand why they feel the way that they do?  What are you hearing in others’ stories that resonates with your experience?  Do you see themes recurring in many comments?  What are you beginning to see as the real causes of this problem? How would you begin to name the problem behind the problem?  When people in the community talk about this issue, what do they say?  Would anyone like to venture a view of the problem that might capture what we’ve been saying? What do we really need to zero in on? What IS the problem?  What are the potential consequences of NOT addressing the problem? If this problem were solved, how would the community be different?2. If THAT is the problem, what are the ways to deal with it?Moderator TipsTry to help the participants group ideas into a manageable number of directions or approaches.  Help group areas of overlap in approaches.  Help the group to discover underlying values (e.g., freedom, security, fairness) associated with each approach.  Don’t let the group get bogged down with the past (e.g. “We’ve already done that and it didn’t work.”). Instead of closing out a past approach, encourage participants to think about what they would do differently, knowing what they know now.More QuestionsWhat are your thoughts about possible approaches to tackling this problem?  As we look at the list, what seems valuable that each approach is trying to protect? Do other approaches seem designed to protect the same or similar interests held valuable? Can these perhaps be combined?  Can we bring these approaches down to three or four that seem to have priority?  Talking about the approaches one by one:Do you think the approach is feasible?  Who might support it? What would be their reasons for doing so?  Who might oppose it? Why?  What might be the consequences, both positive and negative, should this approach be fully realized?  What might we have to give up in order to realize this approach? Are we prepared to accept the trade-offs necessary to realize this approach?Is there one approach that might be tried first?3. How can WE take action to address the problem?Moderator TipsDiscourage the urge to advocate for more outside resources before exhausting an inventory of the community’s own resources.  Make sure that for each action, a responsible party is identified.  Make sure that the group creates a timetable and monitoring schedule.  The purpose is to design a range of steps by a widening group of actors that will interact in a way that gradually engages significant parts of the community.  The important result of this stage is that they will have “conspired” with each other by learning: if I do this, I will help you to do what I need you to do. The moderator should try to reinforce this learning.More QuestionsWho is not at the table that we need? What persons or groups should we approach to share our ideas?  What resources do we have to address the problem? What resources do we need?  How can we build on the work of organizations that are already involved in this issue in the community? How can we build connections and encourage ongoing communication between these organizations?  What benefits, if any, do you think the community could gain from working on this issue with neighboring communities? What assets or resources might we combine? What barriers or challenges might have to be overcome?  What are the obstacles to moving in the direction we want to pursue? What steps can overcome the obstacles? Who can take those steps? Who will do what?  How can we sequence those steps so they support each other?  What is a realistic timeline for action? How will we monitor progress?  What is one step that we could take in the next 60 days to take action on this issue in the community? What is one step that you are willing to take personally?  What role will this group play in the process? How often should we meet?Questions about Community QuestionsAs a result of this process, are you thinking differently about:  The ability of citizens to make a difference in this community?  The ways that political leaders, leaders of community institutions, and professionals view community problems versus how other citizens see these problems?  The way that political and other institutional leaders involve (or don’t involve) citizens in the decisions they make?  The point of view of those with whom you disagree?  New ways in which collective decision-making like this might be used in the community (city government, schools, churches, etc)?  Opportunities to connect organizations in the community who may not be working together currently?  How do you plan to share what you’ve learned with groups in which you are involved? Do you see new ways for these groups to become more involved in community life?  What would our community look like if more people were productively engaged in public issues and public life?  What questions are you leaving with?Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this tool/technique?

[1]  The Netherlands is a multi-party party political system with three dominant parties and thirty total political parties, each with comprehensive and often overlapping platforms. [2]  Currently, there are fifteen distinct political parties represented in the Dutch Parliament, none of which hold anywhere near a majority; the most well represented party is the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy, with 32 of a possible 149 seats. [3]  Due to the large breadth of political parties from which to select, Dutch voters may have a difficult time selecting from the myriad of options available to them.  StemWijzer  helps voters identify which parties they agree with most based on whether they agree or disagree with a series of relevant political statements. [4]StemWijzer  is a tool to understand substantive differences between parties and how an individual’s opinions align with that of each party; it is not necessarily prescriptive, and users are free to ultimately decide which parties they will vote for on election day. [5][6]  At the same time,  StemWijzer  serves as an indicator for making a choice based on political party. [7]Origins and DevelopmentStemWijzer  was developed in 1989 by the Citizenship Science Foundation (SBK), what was then the Netherlands Center for Political Education, in collaboration with the Documentation Centre of Dutch Political Parties (DNPP) and the faculty of Political Management of the University of Twente. It was originally published as a written brochure as well as on a diskette. It consisted of sixty propositions and statements, many of which were pulled directly from election manifestos of political parties. [8]  The first  StemWijzer  was designed as a tool for junior-high education, and although the booklet was popular in the education sector, only fifty diskette copies were sold. [9]  The idea for a voting aid came from Paul Lucardie, an employee of the Documentation Center for Dutch Political Parties. [10]  A more advanced digital version of  StemWijzer  was released leading up the 1994 elections, but despite greater publicity in nation-wide newspapers and radio interviews, use remained limited. [11]  In 1998,  StemWijzer  was distributed both via diskette and on the Internet. The 1998 Internet version garnered 6500 users. By 2006,  StemWijzer  was used by about five million people. [12]  In 2020, the  Stemwijzer  was used about 7 million times; the Netherlands as a whole has a population of about 17 million and had a voter turnout rate of 77.6% in 2020. [13]StemWijzer  is currently developed and operated by ProDemos- House for Democracy and the Rule of Law, which absorbed the Dutch Institute for Political Participation in 2010. [14]  ProDemos receives subsidies from the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations and the House of Representatives of the States General, in addition to subsidies from third parties for individual projects from municipalities, provinces, and other clients. [15]Participant Recruitment and SelectionParticipation in the  StemWijzer  is voluntary and self-selective. The  StemWijzer  has its own website through which users take the survey. ProDemos also makes  StemWijzer  on a smaller scale on behalf of municipal and provincial governments, as well as international  StemWijzers . [16]  Since the 2002 and 2003 parliamentary election cycles,  StemWijzer  has become both an election tradition and a household name in the Netherlands. This can be partially attributed to the 2002 campaign of Pim Fortuyn and his creation of a new political party (LPF).  StemWijzer ’s inclusion of LPF in its 2002 version significantly increased its popularity as a tool for understanding one’s own political position on controversial issues, and was bolstered by another dramatic election four short months later. [17]  Although exciting elections gave  StemWijzer  a much-needed publicity boost, its meteoric rise in popularity was also in large part due to increased Internet access, word-of-mouth dissemination, increased news coverage of the process.  StemWijzer  organized various TV and radio debates on the issue statements in the early 2000s, which further helped it take root in Dutch political culture. [18]What Went On: Process, Interaction, and ParticipationStemWijzer  presents users with thirty statements, then compares respondent answers with the positions of the political parties. Each statement is accompanied by the option to view more information on the issue; for example, a statement regarding refugees would allow users to read a short blurb about current refugee policy in the Netherlands. Users can also choose to see which parties agree or disagree with each statement.  [19]  The issues that are presented in these thirty statements are based on party platforms and issues in the news media to avoid the  StemWijzer  itself setting a policy agenda. [20]  ProDemos also uses voter panels, in which citizens indicate which themes they consider important, in order to determine the subject of questions. ProDemos selects statements that reflect distinctions between parties in order to help users determine which specific party they most align with. Users must select “Agree,” “Disagree,” or “Neither” for each statement, and may opt in to view additional context on the issue presented in the statement. At the end of the survey, users can indicate which topics they find especially important, and can choose to exclude smaller parties from their results. Based on the user’s political opinions,  StemWijzer ’s algorithm then matches voters to political parties. Every statement for which user and party gave the same answer count as one point, and positions to which users assigned extra weight produce two points. At the end of the survey, all points are tallied and output to show which parties the user agreed with from most similar to least similar. [21][22]StemWijzer  2021 provides information on all thirty distinct political parties, which may draw increased attention to smaller parties; however,  StemWijzer  offers an option to only output parties that currently hold a seat in Parliament. [23][24]The process of selecting issue statements is essential in the creation of each  StemWijzer  iteration. Editors select issue statements from the election manifestos and programs of various political parties, with particular attention to the dispersion of issues, controversiality, and balanced positive and negative positions. This first pass at statement selection produces a few hundred theses, which are then introduced to voters’ panels, where voters are enabled to indicate which issues they consider most important and add additional statements. [25][26]  As a result of this process, around fifty issue statements remain and are disseminated to political parties, which indicate their agreement, disagreement, or neutrality toward the statements and provide feedback on the statements’ formulation and breadth of content. ProDemos then eliminates statements that are insufficiently controversial (i.e. statements which do not have at least one party agreeing or disagreeing, statements toward which too many parties adopt a neutral position, etc.) and incorporate feedback from political parties. ProDemos considers diversity in statement themes and party positions in making the final selection of 25 to 30 issue statements. [27]Influence, Outcome, and EffectsAlthough designed and disseminated predominantly for educational purposes, by nature  StemWijzer  has a political bent. Each year, hundreds of thousands of Dutch voters may be influenced to change their votes based on the results of the  StemWijzer . A survey of StemWijzer users in 2006 found that 10% of users intended to change their vote based on the information they received from the Voting Advice Application. StemWijzer 2006 counted 4.7 million users, about 40% of the Dutch electorate, which amounts to hundreds of thousands of votes potentially changed according to StemWijzer’s advice. [28]  Its effects do not stop at the border, however: since  StemWijzer  was initially distributed, it has inspired the creation and development of various other Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) in Europe. 2002 saw the first use of the German Wahl-O-Mat, a national VAA, and in 2007, a French VAA was created for the presidential and parliamentary elections. In 2009, ProDemos produced a pan-European version of  StemWijzer  in addition to national versions for twelve other members of the European Union. Currently, over forty online VAAs are used across Europe.Analysis and Lessons LearnedStemWijzer  has been accused of lacking requisite depth into various issues. Results are calculated from statements which have been criticized for insufficient nuance, which may inaccurately capture the political stance of a given party or the opinion of a given user. Parties are encouraged to fill out the  StemWijzer  in order to better match with voters, but this lack of nuance in the given statements can lead to discrepancies between a party’s response to a statement in the  StemWijzer  and its official party platform. [29]  Discrepancies between party platform and party response to the  StemWijzer  may increase voter confusion rather than clarifying policy stances on important issues. Moreover, a simple “Agree,” “Disagree,” or “Neither” option selection on the part of the user may not convey important information as to why the user agrees or disagrees with the statement, a justification which may meaningfully affect voting habits. A voter may also express their opinion differently depending on how aware they are of the issue in question, but  StemWijzer  requires users to opt in to limited contextual information rather than providing it by default.StemWijzer  may also lack breadth in its collection of issue statements. The Dutch multi-party system allows for parties organized around a single issue, which are unable to sufficiently elucidate their particular ideology via the  StemWijzer;  instead, the format demands that these parties define their stance on subjects which may be irrelevant to their ideology and issue focus. The user’s ability to opt out of being matched with small parties exacerbates this issue, potentially depriving small parties of much-needed publicity. Although  StemWijzer  tries to avoid setting policy agendas in their selection of important issue statements, the popularity of the platform may inadvertently elevate certain issues to the detriment of others due to the limited number of statements provided.  That said,  StemWijzer  is exceptionally well-used in the Netherlands and has been a trusted source of political information for decades; so much so that nearly all European countries now have at least one comparable Voting Advice Application. The widespread educational effects of  StemWijzer  should not be overlooked, nor should its particular relevance in countries with multi-party systems and many parties from which to select.

As public mistrust of the Taiwanese government grew, the government sought to restore public confidence by engaging protestors and activists. They brought them around the table with experts and government officials. By setting up a virtually based, open consultation platform, vTaiwan, the Taiwanese government engaged g0v activists (pronounced “gov-zero”), the civic technology community that had organized large-scale demonstrations against the Ma administration, which culminated in a month-long student takeover of the Taiwanese Parliament. vTaiwan brought together together various stakeholders to find consensus on often controversial issues which the government sought to address, such as UberX regulation. vTaiwan’s discussions sought to craft policies adopted by the government or to be passed through the Parliament as legislation.  Origins and Development  The Sunflower Movement sprouted in March and April 2014 to protest the Ma administration’s fast-tracking of the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement with China. This movement was organized by g0v and other student activists and enjoyed widespread public support. [i] To respond to protestors and rebuild legitimacy, the Ma’s Kuomintang government appealed directly to civil society and activists to devise a system of state-civil society cooperation. Their outreach efforts included engaging in dialogue with activists and attending g0v-organized hackathons, which were events in which attendees would work together to propose solutions to policy problems.  At a g0v Hackathon in December 2014, Minister without Portfolio Jaclyn Tsai asked for volunteers to “create a platform for rational discussion and deliberation of policy issues that the entire nation could participate in.” [ii] The digital activists built vTaiwan, an open consultation process which brought together experts, government officials, stakeholders, and citizens to create consensus and recommendations for national legislation. [iii]  [iv] vTaiwan set a precedent of participation-oriented reforms in Taiwan brought about by the government and civil society. Subsequent reforms included the Join platform in 2015 and participatory budgeting processes in 2016. [v]Since its inception, the government has used vTaiwan to address thirty issues, including online alcohol sales (2016), UberX regulation (2016), and policies encouraging a “sharing economy” (2018). [vi] While theoretically unlimited in scope, the incumbent Tsai administration has largely used vTaiwan to crowdsource legislation related to the digital economy.  Volunteers from g0v and the Science and Technology Law Institute, making up the “Coherent Blended Volition,” organize vTaiwan, forming one of the two key branches of support for this program. A task force of g0v members work together to administrate the program and are responsible for its upkeep. These g0v volunteers also update the content that g0v uses, for example on its website. Individuals from the Science and Technology Law Institute, which is a government-affiliated NGO, are responsible for making government and citizen proposals accessible to the public. These volunteers strip the proposals or jargon and ensure that citizens not familiar with these issues can understand the case and its arguments. [vii]Support from the national government extends beyond the Science and Technology Law Institute’s responsibilities as vTaiwan receives its funding from the government. (More information about the budget for vTaiwan could not be found.) Government buy-in, usually in the form of issue sponsoring or general approval of action on a topic, is a pre-requisite for support for vTaiwan’s procession on a given issue. [viii] Despite this, many analysts consider vTaiwan to be independent of the government because volunteers and citizens ultimately shape the results of the system. These analysts argue that government buy-in is important for the success of the system.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  vTaiwan’s mailing list includes 200,000 individuals as of 2020. [ix] This mailing list is publicized and those who wish to enroll are free to do so. Additionally, as mentioned later, organizers also engage in targeted recruitment of stakeholders in their attempts to expand the mailing list. Not all who are enrolled, however, actively participate in the program, which is defined as those who “provid[e] comments, opinions, or ask questions to ministries.” [x] According to a 2017 Nesta Report, discussions on vTaiwan’s Pol.is platform have included as few as 350 participants and as many as 2,300 participants. [xi] These participants are self-selected, and most participants likely receive notice about weekly hackathon meetings from the mailing list (though all Taiwanese are welcome to participate). Thus, participants are likely motivated to discuss and passionate about issues at hand. This recruitment and selection process, however, likely leaves behind less educated, less wealthy stakeholders or those who may belong to marginalized communities.  In addition to citizen participants, vTaiwan organizers network to recruit and invite relevant experts, representatives from organized stakeholder groups, and government officials. More practically, this takes the form of ministerial networks from the government, g0v’s activist circle, vTaiwan’s mailing list, and paid advertising, especially on social media. Organizers may target certain individuals and ask them to invite others from their own social network. [xii]How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  vTaiwan uses deliberation and open consultation as a means to reach consensus and make recommendations for the government. g0v reached this method by centering “multistakeholderism,” which refers to the varied positions that stakeholders took on issues, which in turn would divide society. g0v believed that direct democratic reforms like referendums had only further divided Taiwanese society. Instead, they proposed that vTaiwan should allow facilitators to have more control over deliberativeforumsand questioning in expert sessions.  g0v has also identified consensus as the goal of all action. [xiii] They believe that this fostered healthy political dialogue and incentivized nuanced thought which would gain greater approval. vTaiwan’s methods and tools encourage and “gamify” consensus, as discussed in the next section. This rough consensus, as identified by the computer system Pol.is through audience voting, then goes on to shape the focus of following discussions and eventual drafted policy or legislation. While there is no requirement that vTaiwan deliberations end in consensus, consensus is crucial for vTaiwan’s latter stages.  To encourage self-scrutiny, greater understanding, and consensus, facilitators employ the Focused Conversation Methods. This method is also known as the ORID Method, where “O” stands for the “objective stage” where participants share facts and data, “R” stands for the “reflective stage” where participants share feelings and emotions, “I” stands for the “interpretive stage” where participants share opinions and values, and “D” stands for the “decisional stage” where participants reach consensus and finalize decisions. [xiv] As following sections describe, facilitators are expected to shepherd discussion, collect and provide resources for participants to make informed choices, invite stakeholders to the discussion, and encourage consensus-building.  The vTaiwan process involves four stages: (1) Proposal, (2) Opinion, (3) Reflection, and (4) Legislation. Organizers emphasize that this process is flexible, and that deliberation and consultation may lead to reversals to previous stages.The Proposal Stage. vTaiwan begins discussion of topics with their weekly Wednesday mini-Hackathon, which is held in both virtually and in-person. Because of vTaiwan’s relatively wide reach, “programmers, developers, public servants, journalists, scholars, legal specialists and students” have all regularly attended these mini-Hackathons. These participants may submit an issue for discussion to relevant government bodies, who decide whether they wish to continue discussion of the issue, and vTaiwan facilitators, who can choose to “adopt” the issue. Without support from these two groups, the vTaiwan process will not go forward. If the process does go forward, participants discuss these issues and jot down notes on HackPad (a real-time collaborative tool), research information and present on SlideShare, and identify stakeholders to invite to future meetings.The Opinion Stage. In the next – month-long – stage, organizers publish documents, research, and presentations relevant to the issue at hand on the vTaiwan website, providing a glossary to aide comprehension as well. [xv] They then kick off deliberation with “rolling questionnaires,” which ask stakeholders about experiences of and knowledge about the topic, as well as any other stakeholders they would invite to fill out the questionnaire. Organizers then create an online forum where participants can ask questions using Discourse to receive government input within a week. They can also post statements and mark “agree”, “disagree,” “pass,” and whether they believe another statement is important. Pol.is, the other software used in this stage, tries to build consensus by visually mapping these opinions. This map, called an opinion landscape, uses machine learning to highlight main camps of opinion, points of consensus, and non-mainstream opinions. These visuals incentivize participants to create statements that are nuanced, consensus-driven, and likely to be featured. At the end of this stage, organizers produce raw and analyzed reports of forum interactions to be published publicly and sent to relevant governmental bodies. Statements around which there is a rough consensus and polarizing statements are highlighted in these reports and go on to shape discussion topics in the following stages. [xvi]The Reflection Stage. Two in-person meetings determine whether another month of opinion should be held or whether they can proceed with the reflection stage. This stage invites key active stakeholders and experts to an in-person consultation, which is also streamed online on Livehouse.in and YouTube where participants can ask questions using a chat feature. The consultation is carefully planned with specific attention paid to finding a facilitator, defining the issue and its scope, holding a pre-meeting between the facilitator and the government body, and creating a specific meeting agenda. [xvii]  [xviii] At the meeting, the facilitator first summarizes the progress made so far, and then allows stakeholders to present and field questions. To help the public, the facilitator takes notes and projects them live and posts the livestream on Facebook where public discussion continues. [xix]The Legislative Stage. After the reflection stage, participants and government representatives discuss the results of the previous stages and where a “rough consensus” may lie. Organizers take this rough consensus and turn it into a policy which then is presented as a guideline or policy for a government agency or legislation in Parliament. These two options force the government to either accept the results of the process or to explain why it is not accepting the suggestions. [xx]Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  The vTaiwan process offers an example of a successful and structured deliberation. The government has executed over 80 percent of vTaiwan’s proposals. While vTaiwan’s use has not been particularly broad reaching, it leads to deep consultation and higher likelihood of action. It also has allowed the public to ask their government questions, which are answered swiftly. The public has also broadened realms of conversation. For example, deliberations on digital technology led organizers to initiate a separate conversation about nonconsensual pornography, which generated widespread discussion and action to address this problem. [xxi] Analysts, participants, and local media have also praised vTaiwan for its ability to bridge online and offline formats, [xxii] as well as its ability to recreate the consensus-driven social interacts not normally found on social networking sites, [xxiii] both important considerations for the contemporary, post-COVID world.  Originally designed to increase the government’s legitimacy, vTaiwan’s limited scope might limit any conclusions we may draw about a legitimizing effect. [xxiv] Seven years on, however, activists and media still see vTaiwan as a way for the people to have a say in government decisions and a way for the government to seek legitimacy, such as in a 2020 controversy on electronic ID cards. [xxv] vTaiwan successfully provided a medium for the government, civil society, and the people to communicate.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  At the core of vTaiwan and its successes is the cooperation between government and civil society. Because of the government’s role in vTaiwan’s developing and funding, vTaiwan has enjoyed credibility among the general public for being effective. Additionally, the government has required all ministries to have “participation officers” who engage with vTaiwan and who answer participant questions within a week, [xxvi]  which creates a channel of listening and understanding between the government and its constituents. vTaiwan can also draw on government networks to invite important stakeholders to the table, who may not engage otherwise.  Despite the government’s role, vTaiwan also enjoys a reputation of neutrality because g0v volunteers handle its facilitation. This encourages people of all political backgrounds to join vTaiwan and allows vTaiwan to be flexible in its implementation as well. [xxvii] Some, however, have voiced concerns that the government’s ability to decline issues does present problems with how independent the process is. More recently, they point to the Tsai government’s limited use of vTaiwan and withdrawal of vTaiwan’s legislation as an example of this. [xxviii]Those learning from this process should pay attention to accessibility and participant selection. Since 85 percent of Taiwanese people use the Internet and 90 percent are on Facebook, vTaiwan’s online components appear accessible. [xxix] But, because of its online nature and participant self-selection, participants likely have higher socioeconomic statuses. Moreover, vTaiwan’s dependence on networking means that participants and invited stakeholders may not be representative of the whole population. All this might harm vTaiwan’s legitimacy in the eyes of the public.  All in all, vTaiwan can be considered a successful example of an open consultation democratic innovation that has been cited internationally by media outlets such as Wired , [xxx] the MIT Technology Review , [xxxi] and Slate . [xxxii] To adjust this to other contexts, however, requires understanding of internet access, and new implementations of similar programs should consider the limits of participant self-selection and over-reliance on political networks. This being said, if one values voices that are invested in a given issue rather than a representative set of participants, inviting known stakeholders and self-selected participants is helpful.

In fact, ""opinion polls show a vacuum of political representation, disrespect for traditional political institutions, and widespread pessimism about the future"" [1]. Previously a harbinger of democracy, the Greek Parliament is now a painful reminder to many Greek citizens of the ""systemic failure"" of their institutions during a period of crisis [1]. Ever since Greece was obliged to implement harsh austerity measures in order to avoid bankruptcy, the rise of unemployment especially among the youth produced political radicalization, extremism, and rejection of the establishment parties. Public frustration however comes with a growing demand for more participation in decision and policy making, hence the surge of open government and political technology initiatives, especially by startups, policy makers, urban activists, and engineers.  VouliWatch ""aims to boost participation in the political process by providing a platform through which citizens can have their concerns and claims heard, influence legislation, and contribute to increased political accountability"" [1]. It also stands for reforms in the legislation-making process in Greece, the promotion of parliamentary transparency, and good government among the three interacting powers (judiciary, executive, and legislature). Capitalizing on a series of pre-existing good open government practices and the growing demand for openness and participation in legislation politics, the project utilizes social media , TV appearances, and public events to engage more with the younger strata and create a massive circle of volunteers and supporters to boost its effort [1].  Origins and Development  The idea to create a ""Parliament watch"" ( Vouli in Greek means ""parliament"") digital platform in Greece was conceived by Antonis Schwarz, a young entrepreneur in 2013, after the success of such a platform in Germany [1]. Schwarz met Panagiotis Vlachos, a lawyer and public policy expert who had pioneered open government applications during his tenure in the Greek government and who had just returned to Athens, Greece after a one-year break to attend a Masters' Degree in Boston, USA. Vlachos' focus on innovations in the public sector coincided with Schwarz's preparatory work on VouliWatch, hence they decided to cooperate, prepare a strategy plan, look for technical support and create a team aspiring to change the rules of parliamentary politics in Greece. Before long, the final line up had been completed in January 2014. Crowd Policy, a Greek start up whose founding members (Michael Psalidas, Giorgos Karamanolis) had prototyped and executed innovative applications for the Greek public administration (e.g. ""Clarity"" (""Diavgea"" in Greek) program to promote transparency, "" OpenGov "" for open public consultations) were responsible for the development of the digital platform. Maria Nathanael (lawyer, current Chief of Communications) and Nadja Drakoula (lawyer, writer and communications specialist) took over all promotional and communications affairs and drafted a detailed  social media  plan. Irene Kostaki became the major content manager of the website and VouliWatch's official correspondent for paliamentary affairs. The team has been managed by Stefanos Loukopoulos. Together with Schwarz (international relations) and Vlachos (strategy and public policy), they decide on all matters that relate to the project, and its operational and economic development.  In early 2014, the team organized a series of open consultations and meetings, where legislators, policy makers, entrepreneurs, journalists and activists contributed with ideas and offered their generous support. In February 2014, the team invited all parliamentarians and their assistants to an informative meeting, during which both sides exchanged views and concerns on their future cooperation. Almost 1/5 of the total MP number was present, whereas no MP from the Communist Party (""KKE"") or the Golden Dawn Party ever responded to the VouliWatch's calls to endorse the initiative or answer citizens' questions [2]. The project was launched on March 16, 2014 and went viral on the same day within the Greek digital media [3]. Loukopoulos, Vlachos, Schwarz and Drakoula have made considerable TV and radio appearances to promote the platform. For the Greek general election, the team decided to use part of their funds to expand the functions of the platform in an effort to inform citizens' on parties' agendas and new candidates. Having cultivated good relations with the NGO community and the open data movement in Greece, VouliWatch prepared a one-day session for Greek NGOs to lobby the Greek Parliament on issues related to environmental protection, social policies, welfare, homelessness, civic engagement, urban renewal, and more. On the foreign affairs front, the project endorsed the efforts of the Sunlight Foundation and OpeningParliament.org to promote parliamentary transparency, while it became a member of the 1st Forum for the Open Government Partnership in Greece in January 2015.  How It Works  Despite its focus on the Greek political system, the initiative welcomes participation by all citizens who are keen to explore the responsiveness of the Greek legislation-makers. Everyone can register as a member in order to ask questions, evaluate MP activity, raise issues and introduce new policy ideas.  The web app has 5 main functions:Ask the MPs / MEPsCrowdsource  ideas  Monitor MP voting behaviour  The Observatory (live newsfeed directly from the Parliament)  Issue of the Month (an online debate that results to a 'live' political lab)And two 'special functions' were introduced for the 2015 general election:Policy Monitor (comparison and evaluation of parties' agendas)  Candidate Watch (presentation and citizens' interaction with party candidates)Analysis and Lessons Learned  As of January 2015, the website had 44,470 unique visitors, 1048 participants submitting 409 questions to MPs (receiving 50 MP answers) and 25 crowdsourced ideas.  Despite the existing digital divide, a widespread public skepticism against political institutions, the nascent status of open government in Greece and a non-responsive majority of Greek MPs, VouliWatch has managed to establish itself as a considerable open government and civic engagement organization in Greece since its launch in March 2014. Given the polarized political culture that favours criticism over positive contribution, the VouliWatch team invested most of its resources in user-friendly tools and social-media outreach in order to win the hearts and minds of the internet users as a credible, non-partisan and independent source of information that extends beyond the limits of online organizing. The team fostered partnerships both at the domestic and at the foreign level with foundations, NGOs and organizations to promote open government, transparency, accountability and civic empowerment in a more systematic fashion. It has also sought close cooperation with the Greek Parliament administration and the Ministry of Reform and e-Government and it managed to join the Forum of the Open Government Partnership in Greece that will be assessing the progress of openess reforms in the future. Having 'survived' three elections over a very thin time period (parliamentarian, European and presidential), VouliWatch seized the opportunity to experiment with new innovative tools and outreach methods in order to appeal to wider audiences, empower more citizens, produce credible information, create partnerships and pave new paths in digital democracy.

The AskThem platform allows residents of the United States to search for federal and state representatives based on their locations. Users in most major cities can also access information on municipal officials and candidates. AskThem.io's data sources offer the largest coverage of mayors, county government officials, and city council members of any open-source website [1].  The main purpose of AskThem.io is to connect citizens with their representatives in government, improving government transparency and civic engagement. The platform gives any resident of the United States the ability to ask questions of officials registered on the site [1].  Origins and Development  AskThem is a non-partisan project of the Participatory Politics Foundation , a ""501(c)3 non-profit organization with a mission to increase civic engagement"" [1]. From 2007 through 2013, PPF created and operated OpenCongress.org, the most-visited non-profit website in the world for tracking the U.S. Congress.Conceived in 2004, the main problem that OpenCongress sought to address was a lack of accessible information online about bills, votes, and issues in the U.S. Congress. The official website of Congress, THOMAS, published raw data about legislation, but not in ways that are compliant with the community-generated Principles of Open Government Data, not in sufficiently timely ways, and not on webpages that were proven to be user-friendly.The platform was acquired by Sunlight Foundation in 2014 but has since returned to the PPF [1].  OpenGovernment  was designed to bring the OpenCongress model of transparency down to state and local governments. AskThem.io's development was supported by a charitable grant from the Knight Foundation 's  Tech 4 Engagement  initiative [1]. The site's management team actively sources charitable funding support to maintain the platform.  How It Works  There are two types of participants on AskThem.io—members of the public and government representatives. Anyone living in the United States is eligible to sign-up for an AskThem.io account. Representatives are likewise eligible to sign-up but their identity must be verified (often by connecting a verified Twitter account). Over 70 elected officials nationwide  [2] signed-up to respond to public questions, ""including  five NYC council members ,  three NY state legislators , the  mayor of Austin TX , Lee Leffingwell; and  five of seven Austin city councilors ; plus MA gubernatorial candidate Don Berwick"" among many others [1].  AskThem.io uses  information and communications technology  to connect citizens with public officials and information on representatives from all levels of government. Using the platform, users can pose questions directly to representatives, read other users questions and answers, search for representatives and candidates in their area, access and use the website's open-sourceware and datasets, and receive other up-to-date information and news on public officials through the AskThem.io blog. Individuals who wish to can support questions that other users pose, by ""voting them up and circulating them like online  petitions "" [1]. As a question is voted up to reach a pre-set threshold, the recipient has the question sent to them by AskThem, encouraging a ""public response"" [1].  Analysis and Lessons Learned  From 2007-2014, AskThem.io received ""over 27 million web visits and 69 million pageviews"" [1]. The website has successfully publicized aggregated data on the ""closed-off federal legislative process, including the essential money-in-politics info that lies behind which bills get advanced...[and] public comment forums on bills and votes now makes it easier for users to follow recent developments and crowdsource analysis (such as on unemployment extensions)"" [1].  In place since 2007, the platform has so far been unsuccessful in developing an effective platform for ongoing, two-way communication with Congress. Continual, reciprocal online public dialogue on priorities and policy remains a distinct goal. The website management team has engaged in ""back-channel communication with Hill staffers and Library of Congress tech staff"", but lacked the resources necessary to optimize AskThem.io for use as a channel to pressure for open communications between constituents and official [1].  However, AskThem.io does at least create the online space and tools necessary for continual, structured dialogue with every U.S. elected official. Similar to AskThem.io is the ""White House’s “We The People” petition platform [which] has been proven to increase public trust and engagement, with over 8 million people signing questions for a public response"" [1]. While not technically possible back in 2007, large-scale data coverage and online interaction are now made feasible by Google’s development of a powerful open API as well as the growing #opengov community. These new events also signal a desire for more government transparency and public engagement, both of which could work in favour of AskThem.io's improvement.

It was developed in response to a trend toward lower trust in government institutions like the U.S. Congress, low voter turnout, and lack of compliance with the Principles of Open Government Data by US state governments. Out of the 49 bicameral state legislatures in the U.S. and one unicameral body (Nebraska), only one single chamber—one entity out of 99, namely the New York State Senate—makes its legislative data available in ways that sufficiently comply with the community-generated Eight Principles of Open Government Data. Every other chamber of state government was thought to be closed-off from its constituents, refusing to release public data (legislative actions, votes, bill analysis—not to mention campaign contributions) online in ways that are truly open, despite the readily available technical means to do so. The ultimate mission of OpenGovernment was to ensure that all three branches (executive, legislative, and judicial) at every level of government (federal, state, city, local, and more) comply with the Principles of Open Government Data, to increase trust in the political process.  Further, PPF perceived the status quo for state-level government websites to be a mishmash of non-standards-based, poorly-designed websites that don't do nearly enough to keep the public at large informed. They're simply unacceptably user-unfriendly, so they aimed to introduce open-source software, open standards, flexible copyright licensing, and easily-findable technical best practices make it possible for any branch of state government to comply with the Eight Principles in a relatively short period of time.  Origins and Development  The site is a non-partisan joint project of two 501(c)3 non-profit organizations, the  Participatory Politics Foundation  and the Sunlight Foundation. OpenGovernment is independent from any government entity, candidate for office, or political party.It was based on the model of PPF's OpenCongress, which was conceived in 2004 to address a lack of accessible information online about bills, votes, and issues in the U.S. Congress. The official website of Congress, THOMAS, published raw data about legislation, but not in ways that are compliant with the community-generated Principles of Open Government Data, not in sufficiently timely ways, and not on webpages that were proven to be user-friendly.The platform was acquired by Sunlight Foundation in 2014 but has since returned to the PPF [1].  Ever since OpenCongress was developed, PPF foresaw that this model of aggregating disparate data sources into a user-friendly web interface could be productively applied to other entities: state legislatures, city councils, neighbourhood associations, international institutions, governorships, secretaries of state, supreme courts, circuit judges, public-mission institutions such as schools &amp; hospitals, foreign countries with more-or-less democratic systems of governance, and more.  How It Works  PPF aims to establish a data standard and collect machine-readable data streams for all 50 U.S. State Legislatures. These data streams will provide official government info to GovKit, the open-source application that combines it with other publicly-available data sources and social wisdom from around the open Web. GovKit, in turn, will power the OpenGovernment website: essentially, free and non-partisan versions of OpenCongress for all fifty state legislatures and a dozen major cities, with even more local versions planned.  ""OpenGovernment can work to combine the following:official government data in federal, state and city government  with campaign donations and intelligible top-line analysis  issue group ratings,  social media conversations,  public meeting schedules,  and open-data contact tools.""

In other words, for policy dialogue to be meaningful, legitimate and effective, it needs to be inclusive and allow for real participation of the main parties concerned.This in turn enhances the chances that the participating stakeholders adopt a more pluralistic outlook on their society. By working together, they are compelled to recognise the existence of a diversity of interests and beliefs regarding a given problem, which naturally leads to different positions towards political choices meant to solve this problem.This acceptance of ‘pluralism’ by the key social and political stakeholders can in turn function as a safeguard against an excessive accumulation of power by any single actor in the political system, as well as a means to overcome the winner-takes-all attitudes that still prevail in many electoral democracies and that lie at the heart of the phenomenon known as populism.The two core values ofinclusivenessandparticipationare streamlined throughout the approach, which was designed to ensure that multi-stakeholder dialogue can be successful in delivering outcomes at three different levels’:policy  ,processandpartnerships  .What is INSPIRED?Integrated Support Programme for Inclusive Reform and Democratic Dialogue (INSPIRED)  aims to address the operational divide between democracy support and the array of instruments aimed at promoting good governance.  In particular, it encouragesinternational aid organisations and practitioners to make use of policy dialogue, by enhancing its inclusiveness and putting in place participatory mechanisms that make it more representative and legitimate.The INSPIRED approach builds on thedemocratic principles of inclusiveness and participation  , which function as its two core values; being both intrinsic and instrumental, they provide the red lines guiding multi-stakeholder dialogue processes. Thanks to its focus on evidence-based policy-making, the method also promotes the principles of transparency and accountability, which are key prerequisites for a functioning democracy. In order to be of practical use in guiding policy dialogue, the two core values of inclusiveness and participation have been streamlined throughout. Further, the method consists ofthree phases: Collective Assessment, Consensus Building and Monitoring and Donor Alignment.Each phase presents a series of tools and techniques that can be used to make policy debate more inclusive and participatory while keeping it oriented to concrete results.Overall management of the dialogue is to be ensured by a “  Dialogue Host  ” that functions as an impartial convener, facilitator, policy analyst and communicator of results. Acting on behalf of the donor while being at the service of the domestic stakeholders participating in the dialogue, the Dialogue Host embodies the idea of a true partnership; one that is based on mutual trust and accountability so as to be responsive to the challenges of consensus-building.The INSPIRED approach issimultaneously policy-oriented, process-oriented and partnership-oriented  . By focusing on the dialogue process around policy choices, it identiﬁes different entry points into the policy cycle, implying different strategies for inﬂuencing decision-making and monitoring implementation.Secondly, given its focus on dialogue, INSPIRED puts strong attention on the notion of process, recognising that in democracy support the means are as important as the end, but nevertheless delivering tangible results such as the Participatory Policy Assessments and Roadmaps for Reform, which are to be produced by the participating stakeholders themselves.And last but not least, INSPIRED brokers the kind of partnerships that are needed to successfully implement any policy reform, promoting coordination and the kind of division of labour that characterises well-articulated policy networks.All these aspects are reﬂected in the I  ntegrated Support Framework (ISF)  , a reporting tool that can be used to present snapshots of the dialogue process at different moments, providing practitioners and the donors with useful insight into the points of contention, as well as the interests and incentives of the participating stakeholders. By presenting this kind of “intelligence” in a focused and structured way – identifying potential gridlocks and conﬂicting visions as well as real windows of opportunity – the ISF can help donors and implementing agencies design and coordinate programmes and assistance measures in a way that ensures their alignment with locally-led processes of reform.Find more about what is INSPIREDhere.How does INSPIRED work in practice?For practical purposes and in line with many other dialogue methods, the INSPIRED approach is structured around three interrelated phases. These phases provide a clear framework for cooperation for all the actors involved and give direction to the dialogue process.Each phase – (1) Collective Assessment, (2) Consensus Building and (3) Monitoring and Alignment – is oriented towards delivering different results of the joint work of the stakeholders involved: a Participatory Policy Assessment (1), a Roadmap for Reform (2) and a Policy Network Strategy (3).The process is facilitated by a Dialogue Host, an organisation that assembles and guides all other stakeholders throughout the process. The Dialogue Host needs to invest itself in creating the conditions for trust to arise among dialogue participants, even those that may not be on good terms with each other.Experience has shown that instead of representing a clear sequence, the borders between the three phases tend to be ﬂuid, which is due in part to the iterative nature of any dialogue process. Indeed, the stakeholders can always ‘take a step backwards’ to review their initial assessment of the policy under discussion (building on new data collected at a later stage, for instance) or pause to assess new developments with a view to ﬁnding room for a consensus. Therefore, rather than as phases stricto sensu, the phases of the INSPIRED approach should be understood as a continuum punctuated by a whole series of joint events and common achievements that need to ﬁt into the bigger political picture.This degree of ﬂexibility with regard to the sequencing of dialogue meetings and events poses high demands on the Dialogue Host, which must remain alert to any changes in the policy landscape and in the delicate interplay between the political actors and stakeholders, and ready to adapt the whole process to those unknown factors that will surely arise in the dialogue process.Find more about how INSPIRED workshere.Why does INSPIRED make such a difference ?The INSPIRED approach builds on thedemocratic principles of inclusiveness and participation  , which function as its two core values; being both intrinsic and instrumental, they provide the red lines guiding multi-stakeholder dialogue processes.

By presenting this kind of “intelligence” in a focused and structured way – identifying potential gridlocks and conﬂicting visions as well as real windows of opportunity – the ISF can help donors and implementing agencies design and coordinate programmes and assistance measures in a way that ensures their alignment with locally-led processes of reform.For implementing INSPIRED and delivering its key results – namely the Participatory Policy Assessment, the and the Roadmap for Reform and the Policy Network –, practitioners of policy-dialogue must first consider the interplay of the three interconnected dimensions that conform its three-tier approach: policy, process and partnership.Policy… i.e. linked to a concrete policy reform effortPolicy can be conceptualised as a middle ground between the political and the technical that allows stakeholders to structure their discussion along commonly shared concepts, methods and evidence. Indeed, one of the key lessons that we learned when we conducted the ﬁrst INSPIRED processes was how important it is to structure dialogue around concrete policy issues, to provide otherwise confronted stakeholders with an opportunity to develop a common understanding of the challenges at stake and then propose concrete solutions to those challenges.To this end, the promotion of a culture of evidence-based policy-making among the largest possible number of stakeholders is crucial for the success of the dialogue process, as it forces the incumbent government to increase the transparency of its inner workings, which represents a ﬁrst step towards creating mechanisms of accountability. Moreover, basing discussions on knowledge and reliable data is the best way to ensure that the impact of the reform initiatives resulting from the dialogue process can be measured adequately and that any changes in the policy at stake are based on informed decisions.All this may explain why the EU has recently adopted a ‘Policy First’ approach in the programming of its external action. Aware of the huge potential of working at the policy level, the EU’s own development policy currently calls its EU delegations across the world to adopt a multi-stakeholder approach and base the programming of EU funded support on policy dialogue.As policy has progressively come into focus in international development circles, the notion of policy dialogue has gained traction too, including in the EU aid system. Given that the greatest chunk of aid is being mobilised through sector reform, budget support and other financial instruments such as blending, donors have been progressively realising that they need to move beyond the classical “project approach”. Instead, they are increasingly focused on influencing domestic policies and, in this framework, need to identify policy indicators that can determine if the reform processes that they are supporting stay on the right track. For the sake of objectivity and in order to promote transparency, the measurement of these policy indicators cannot be done exclusively with the government, but needs to involve other domestic stakeholders such as civil society organisations, think tanks or subnational governments so as to ensure that the datasets provided by the government are accurate and reliable instead of presenting the donor with a rosy picture ensuring the disbursement of the next financial tranche.Process… i.e. conceived as a dynamic and ﬂexible processIn any dialogue, the means are as important as the end and compromises, or even consensus can only be achieved progressively, taking one step at a time and ensuring that none of the key institutions or stakeholders that are willing to participate are left behind.Indeed, one of the main potential advantages of inclusive and participatory policy dialogue is that it paves the way for mutual recognition among otherwise confronted stakeholders. For this to happen, these actors need to feel that they are being listened to and that their insight and inputs are taken on board by the other dialogue participants and as well as the facilitators of the process. Involvement leads to engagement, which is the basis uponwhich real ownership over policy reform must be built in order for such reform to yield fruit in the medium to long term.Besides, policy work is seldom static, as circumstances change and priorities are frequently redeﬁned – mainly by the oﬃcial policy-makers, which makes it even more important for policy dialogue projects to focus on the many overlapping processes that unfold simultaneously during policy formulation and implementation. Not to speak of those other processes –political, electoral, budgetary, etc. – that are shaping policy to a great extent and that are crucial for understanding the positions and interests of the different stakeholders involved in policy-making.In such a complex system, where most elements are closely interconnected, the success of any given reform depends entirely on the capacity of dialogue facilitators to understand how and when each of the key stakeholders can inﬂuence the policy process. And this is arguably one of the main advantages of adopting a multi-stakeholder approach, as it allows the different types of actors to inﬂuence through dialogue those aspects of their respective agendas or mandates that would otherwise fall out of their reach. Moreover, the exchange of views fostered through dialogue becomes a way of improving policy coordination and promoting a division of labour where speciﬁc tasks are taken care of by those actors who are best placed to do so.Aware of the growing importance of civil society in the policy process, some years ago – coinciding with the implementation of INSPIRED – the EU delegations have been defining their Country Roadmaps for Engagement with Civil Society, consecrating its approach towards the role of civil society organisations in development by moving its focus beyond service providers and watchdogs to full-fledged partners in policy dialogue.Partnership… i.e. oriented towards brokering long-standing partnershipsPutting a strong focus on both the specificities of a given policy (policy orientation) and the inner dynamics of the dialogue process (process orientation) is arguably the most effective way of building solid and long-standing partnerships. In most cases, policy decisions are the result of the interplay amongst the many different actors that conform to what is known as “policy networks”, which bring together more or less powerful players belonging to different working areas that remain, nonetheless, strongly interconnected. Government officials, policy analysts, lobbyists, activists, private companies, think-tankers, scholars, and entrepreneurs may all have different mandates and respond to different incentives, but all tend to know each other and share a common basic understanding of how that given policy works. Actually, many of them may switch positions along with their professional careers, moving from civil society to government, or from government to the private sector, sometimes abusing their position and giving way to the phenomenon known as “revolving doors”.However outrageous this change of sides may appear to external observers, it actually showcases the many communicating vessels that underlie any given policy field and bind together the different policy actors. Managed through open dialogue, these relationships can be mobilised into a force for positive change and broadened to include usually side-lined players. When information is shared on a regular basis – which is what dialogue is about – and the resulting knowledge stems from a collective endeavour, those who partake in it are keener to identify with each other and attain a better understanding of the policy as a whole.This shared vision is essential for the sustainability of policy reform and the creation of long-standing policy partnerships based on a rational and fair division of labour towards the achievement of a collective goal. Once aware of being in the same boat, the different stakeholders will be less inclined to grow in different directions and may proceed to a better distribution of the necessary tasks to achieve policy reform, avoiding overlaps and fostering the kind of synergies that are necessary when resources are limited. More importantly, after working together in the dialogue process and getting to know their respective strengths and constraints, the key stakeholders will have progressively developed the kind of operational partnership that is sought in most development actions but seldom sees the light for lack of mutual understanding.Find more about how INSPIRED makes the difference  here .WHAT CHANGE CAN INSPIRED BRING?Words are easily blown by the wind and many professionals in the development, human rights and democracy and peacebuilding fields are already suffering from what is known as “dialogue fatigue”, which made us realise how crucial it was to instil the INSPIRED dialogues with a strong sense of purpose. However, striving for concrete and measurable results does not necessarily mean that these results need to be predetermined in advance, especially when aiming at a moving target – which is a central feature of any effort to influence policy.If policy dialogue is dynamic by nature and the result of multiple stakeholders interacting with each other, pretending to define its results from the outset is not only a futile effort, but one that risks undermining the local ownership that the dialogue aims to build in the first place. Instead, it should always be up to the key domestic stakeholders to determine what their common objectives are and to frame them within the opportunities and constraints presented by the policy at stake. Moreover, such objectives, once set, should not be cast in stone, as this would significantly limit the dialogue participants’ flexibility and capacity to react to changing dynamics in the policy field.However, avoiding preordained objectives does not mean to neglect results; on the contrary, it allows the stakeholders to focus on what the dialogue process is actually achieving, while adapting to the ever-changing circumstances in the policy and political landscapes. Instead of stubbornly concentrating on the objectives and indicators of a pre-defined log frame, the stakeholders are invited to adapt their priorities and objectives to the changing context, as well as to remain open-minded and focus their attention on the most significant outcomes – planned as well as unforeseen – of their deliberations that could be turned into windows of opportunity to push for the desired reforms.In other words, the orientation towards results is an essential characteristic of the INSPIRED approach, but it has been nuanced to prevent dialogue organisers and facilitators from losing sight of other aspects that are equally important. In a dialogue process, results need to be collectively agreed. They do notneed to be established necessarily at the beginning of a project, but rather assessed in hindsight so as to showcase the impact of the dialogue participants’ joint work and to encourage them to continue their collective endeavour. This realisation is why the evaluation method Outcome Harvesting has been integrated into the approach. It allows the participants in the dialogue process to take stock of the many unforeseen outcomes resulting from their cooperation, thus strengthening their bonds through the realisation of common achievements.The types of change that INSPIRED processes can deliver follow the three orientations of the approach - policy, process &amp; partnership - although many of them cross several categories and cannot be understood isolated from the other transformations that they bring about. However, for the sake of conceptual clarity, we are hereby systematising them into three main areas: pPolicy and&amp; institutional improvements (resulting from the orientation to policy), openness to collaborationbehavioural change (resulting from the orientation to process), and joint action (resulting from the orientation to partnerships).Policy and institutional improvementsThe first type of change that a given INSPIRED process may bring about relates to the policy itself. It would be overly ambitious – and dangerously misleading – to pretend that a dialogue process can be expected to deliver results at the policy level – such as better inclusion of women in the labour market, improved opportunities for PWD workers, improved health services for people without resources, etc. – as these still remain in the responsibility of the government and depend on factors that escape the capacity of the stakeholders involved in the dialogue.More realistically, the success or failure of the dialogue is to be assessed in terms of policy influence, i.e.: the extent to which the conclusions attained by the participants are being taken on board by the actual decision-makers. A condition of such results is the inclusiveness of the policy-making process and the opening of the institutional framework beyond state bodies and agencies. This will allow for the integration of those other actors – CSOs, think tanks, social agents, etc. – that must also have a say if they are expected to engage in policy implementation.Below is a list of some of the outcome areas that can be expected along these lines:Improved policy framing to include multiple and diverse viewsStrengthenedspaces for policy dialogue and evaluationStrengthened policy networks between key formal and informal actorsImproved policy knowledge and access to informationImproved enforcement and policy implementation through division of labourImproved institutional processes through multi-stakeholder coordinationOpenness to collaborationFor an approach that aims at promoting a culture of dialogue and mutual understanding among stakeholders, it would be rather short-sighted to focus exclusively on the so-called “tangible” outcomes, as these are very often just the manifestation of deeper and more transformative type change, that which affects the behaviour of the stakeholders themselves. Indeed, what makes the most difference in the long run is the change of attitude on the side of all those who engage in a dialogue process, as government officials and other duty-bearers accept to open their workings to other actors, while civil society organizations and other right-holders adopt a more constructive approach towards policy making, moving beyond naming, blaming and claiming to engage in proactively in policy design and implementation.Such a change in attitude needs to translate into actual behaviours, which can be appraised because they manifest themselves in concrete actions that can be categorised as follows:Cooperation or willingness to work with othersReform or willingness to improve policy/implementationTransparency or willingness to produce and share informationMonitoring or willingness (and ability) to monitor policy implementation Joint actionFor improvements in policy and changes in behaviour to become long-standing and sustainable, they need to be based upon actual partnerships in which the different parties involved learn to work together and rely on each other for the sake of the policy at stake. This does not mean that partners need to renounce their original mandate or engage in activities that do not fall under their usual line of work. On the contrary, they are expected to keep specialising in whatever they do best, albeit with an eye on what the other stakeholders, now partners, are also doing in their own areas of competence.Only through adequate coordination it will be possible to foster the kind of synergies that are needed for a given policy to thrive. Otherwise, unforeseen overlaps and increasingly divergent views will start to emerge, dispersing efforts and giving way to potential conflicts that can jeopardise all the results already achieved. To avoid this, INSPIRED processes focus on creating the conditions for brokering fruitful partnerships all along the way and include a number of tools to deliver the following type of results:Policy networks identified, mapped and strengthenedJoint projects developedJoint advocacy initiatives collectively conceived and implementedPooling of resourcesImproved access to decision-makers by CSOs and other actorsCSOs securing funds due to INSPIRED supportFind more about INSPIRED on its official websitehere!",1,0,1,1,0,
7673,method,Hierarchical Card Sorting (HCS),https://participedia.net/method/7673,"A simple card-sorting tool for qualitative research and inquiry, which can also be useful for planning and evaluation. A HCS can help make people’s informal and tacit knowledge more explicit and publicly available, contestable and usable.",0,2021-08-20,2021-08-30,418747,rick.davies,https://participedia.net/user/418747,418747,rick.davies,https://participedia.net/user/418747,en,1,both,,open,,low,high,research,,,individuals, small,,no_geo,,,ask, express,,general,,,,,academic,,," Problems and Purpose  HCS is one of many types of card sorting methods (also known as pile sorting). Card sorting has been used in many contexts, from traditional ethnography to the modern day business of designing usable websites. In these contexts card sorting is typically used to elicit people’s mental models: the categories they use, what belongs to these categories, and how the categories relate to each other.  In many organisations people accumulate a lot of knowledge, but often it is tacit and informal in nature. As such. it is not so easily shared. Yet sharing that knowledge can make a difference, other people can make use of it, and they can help correct it and improve it. A HCS can help make people’s knowledge more explicit and publicly available, contestable and usable.  Origins and Development  This variant of card sorting is a tool developed in 1993, as part of  PhD field work on organisational learning  within an NGO in Dhaka, Bangladesh (the Christian Development Commission of Bangladesh (CCDB)). It has since been used as part of project design and project evaluation processes in Nigeria, Ghana, and the United Kingdom.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  There are two kinds of participants: an interviewer and respondents. Respondents may be a single individual or a small group - small enough to quickly come to agreement on their responses to the HCS task  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  There are four main stages, the last two of which are optional1.Listingthe entities to be sorted. These can be people, organisations, locations, or events. The respondent should be expected to know something about them.2.Sorting  : This involves the reiteration of a question: “  What do you think is the most significant difference between all these (  entities  ). Please sort them into two groups of any size. Describe the difference between them and the difference it makes  ” The result is an annotated tree structure, a nested classification like the one shown above.3.Choosing  . The respondent can then be asked a second type of reiterated question, but here the format is more flexible. “  Which of these two groupsdo you think has been more successful?”or “  Which of these two groupshave you spent more time with”And in each case asking a follow up question: “  Why do you think so?”4.Comparing  . A succession of binary choices will generate an overall ranking, as seen above. Rankings of entities based on different choice questions can then be plotted and compared.A detailed description of all steps can be found here:  https://mande.co.uk/special-issues/hierarchical-card-sorting-hcs/#howdoInfluence, Outcomes, and Effects  Value can be obtained from HCS tree diagrams at two stages:(a) during the creation of the tree diagrams, and (b) through comparisons made between parts of the structure once it has been created.1.Ethnographic useDuring creation of a tree diagrams the main use is as a ethnographic tool: a means of understanding people’s view of the world. There are three types of use:  1.1 Identifying the distinctions that people see as important. This is evident in the contents of the differences reported. It is also evident in how early in the exercise they are reported, and how often they are reported (on different branches).  1.2 Identifying the limits to people’s knowledge: When respondents cannot identify differences between two or more entities the limits to their knowledge seem to have been reached. Knowing what people do not know about can be important, especially when they might be expected to, or claim to have, expertise in that area.  1.3 Identifying the direction of learning:It is also worth noting where there is more versus less differentiation of knowledge, visible respectively where where branches end up with a single case rather than multiple cases, which have not yet been differentiated. See Figure 2 above for an example.2.Use after creation2.1 ExploringAfter creation, the tree structure can be used as the basis for a series of judgements, about the future and the past. At each junction judgements can be made about the available binary choices i.e. between the two alterative branches. The process of soliciting and documenting these judgements can proceed in either of two directions: from trunk to leaves, or from leaves to trunk.  Some examples of questions that can be asked at each junction are:“How will your work in the next six months with this group be different, compared to this group?”  “Which of these two groups do you plan to be spending more time with ?”,  “Which of these two groups do you expect will present the most problems?”2.2 Creating a Theory of Change with testable predictions  Each branch of a tree diagram can potentially be seen as a causal configuration, i.e.a set of conditions associated with an outcome seen in the entities that have been sorted . A complete set of branches can then be seen as a particular kind of Theory of Change, one that is notably different in at least two ways.  Firstly, because there will be multiple branches – it will be capable to representing equifinality i.e the reality that there are often multiple alternate means of reaching the same outcome. And asymmetrical causal processes i.e. that an outcome can be absent not because of the absence of its usual causes, but become of the presence of other influences.  Secondly, contra to more conventional representations, each segment in a branch is not a consecutive event, forming a chain of events. Rather, each segment is an additional kind of difference that is expected to make a difference to the outcome observable in the entity at the end of each branch.2.3 Aggregating Most Significant Change (MSC) storiesIn the uses described above the focus was on outcomes that are measurable in some way, at least using some form of ranking. But outcomes are often diverse in form and thus not easily measurable. For example in large scale decentralised programmes, and in programmes that emphasises peoples participation in the planning and management of programme resources. These are the circumstances where the  Most Significant Change (MSC ) technique is typically useful.A tree structure generated by a HCS exercise provides a similar structure as a basis for summary by selection. The tree structure can be used like a tennis tournament structure. At the “branch ends” pairs of MSC stories are like entry level tennis players , who can be compared, and the most significant of these then promoted “up” to the next level. There they meet and are compared with another MSC story that has been similarly prompted from the level below. And so on, up the hierarchy.Analysis and Lessons Learned  The most recent use of HCS was aby a consultancy firm, to carry out a stakeholder analysis in the initial stages of an evaluation. Key informants were interviewed using the HCS method, to identify what they saw as the most significant difference between listed stakeholders, and what difference those differences might make to the process, results and use of the proposed evaluation. The tree diagram that was produced highlighted 19 differences with different consequences. The results were assessed as being much more useful than more conventional stakeholder analysis methods such as the creation of an influence x interest plot.  There are also, like many forms of ethnographic inquiry , many areas where the process can experience problems. These are documented, along with proposed solutions, in this step by step guidance:  https://mande.co.uk/special-issues/hierarchical-card-sorting-hcs/#howdoSee AlsoReferences  Some extra resources on card/pile sorting and related methods:Harloff, J., &amp; Coxon, A.

Residents can give vouchers to local candidates they support. Candidates redeem them with the government for campaign funds.

In 2018, the average congressional incumbent raised $1.5 million for their re-election. Even in less expensive state legislative races, many candidates raise well over $150,000 . These high costs create a structural barrier for many challengers, particularly those from non-traditional backgrounds who lack wealthy social networks.  For those who get elected, staying competitive means spending up to half the work day in “ call time ” — dialing big donors for campaign donations. This endless fundraising distracts lawmakers from the job. Many elected officials have admitted that fundraising negatively impacts their job performance. One lawmaker told researchers that “members making decisions cannot devote serious quality time to serious decisions.” Another stated that “[fundraising] crippled my ability to do my job properly.”  Constant fundraising also skews legislators’ perceptions of public opinion. Men, white people, conservatives, and millionaires are dramatically overrepresented in the donor class. While evidence that specific donations buy specific votes is limited, it would be unreasonable to say that spending hours each day listening to the concerns of big donors has no effect on politicians’ views of what the public supports. Given this, it is not surprising that various studies have found that elected officials are most responsive to the policy priorities of wealthy Americans.  The perception that politicians care only about donors also drives widespread public cynicism and disengagement, creating a vicious cycle where the public at large drops out of politics while the wealthy stay engaged. According to Gallup, 75% of Americans believe corruption is widespread throughout the government. It’s no wonder 85% of Americans think the campaign finance system needs “fundamental changes” or must be “completely rebuilt.”  In the past, advocates have tried to design campaign finance systems that block the distorting effects of money in politics by lowering contribution limits and restricting PAC spending. Many of these attempts have been ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Even when they have gone into effect, contributors find new ways to circumvent. An additional approach is needed.  Seattle is the first US jurisdiction to launch a democracy vouchers system. After a ballot initiative passed, a democracy vouchers system was implemented in Seattle’s 2017 and 2019 municipal elections. While big-dollar fundraising is still legal for candidates who opt-out of the voucher program, many problems that result from campaign finance have diminished in the last two elections. Donors are now more representative in terms of race, income, and age, and more evenly distributed throughout the city. Voter engagement has increased , for after using vouchers, people become more likely to vote. In part, this is because candidates are incentivized to talk to ordinary people more, as everyone is worth $100 (the value of Seattle’s vouchers), regardless of their disposable income. New and diverse candidates can run for office and win—with many reporting they could not have raised enough money without vouchers. Most candidates have used vouchers, including most winners: eight of nine sitting council members, for example, used vouchers in their last election.  A functioning democracy requires the engagement of ordinary people, as voters, donors, and candidates. A democracy vouchers system helps meet this requirement not just by limiting big money, but by increasing small money. Every citizen is empowered to donate and every candidate is empowered to use whatever network they have, no matter how economically disadvantaged, as a fundraising base. Plus, since you can enforce extra regulations on candidates who opt-in to soliciting vouchers, the system can enforce spending limits, contribution limits, and disclosure requirements on more candidates and races. By helping make the campaign for donations better resemble the campaign for votes, a democracy vouchers system deepens American democracy.Origins and DevelopmentAfter a 2013 ballot initiative on public matching funds failed in Seattle, advocates regrouped, deciding to try to pass the country's first democracy vouchers system in 2015. Advocates were successful,  passing the ""Honest Elections Seattle"" initiative  on the November ballot with 63% of the vote.  The Seattle Ethics &amp; Elections Commission (SEEC) was tasked with administering the program, starting in the 2017 election cycle. In 2016, the SEEC began implementation, taking deliberate steps to promote community involvement and ensure many people used their vouchers.Focus groupsLeading up to the first use of vouchers in 2017, the SEEC conducted focus groups in four different communities. 95% of focus group participants had not heard of the program and 65% “had never contributed to a candidate or campaign.” These discussions helped voucher administrators determine baseline public awareness, opinions, and misconceptions about the program. This information was used to inform Seattle’s messaging strategies.Communication and messagingOn first use, many residents and candidates had heard of the voucher program, making it essential that the SEEC invested in messaging for candidates and for residents on what vouchers are and how to use them. Eighteen months before Seattle’s first voucher election, the SEEC began producing content on “how to run for office using Democracy Vouchers,” and answering questions from potential candidates. Twelve months before the first voucher election, Seattle sent an informational mailer to 340,000 Seattle residential addresses with basic information about vouchers.  Each election cycle since, the SEEC has spent ~$1,000 on social media advertising (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Nextdoor ads), reaching over 100,000 people, and ~$2,500 on printing and placing posters in business districts. Five months before each election, Seattle launches a “mid-year reminder campaign” to encourage residents to use their vouchers and remind them they can get replacements if lost. The city also produces short how-to videos on receiving, assigning, and returning vouchers.Accessibility and community involvementThe SEEC hosts a website where users can learn about program rules and eligibility, apply for and submit vouchers, and learn about candidates. In 2017, Seattle’s website received nearly two million unique page views. Seattle also implemented a hotline for questions, which averaged 1500 calls per election cycle.  The SEEC has tried to engage traditionally underrepresented groups by administering the program in multiple languages and working with community groups that can spread information about the program. In Seattle, the voucher program was administered in 15 languages, meaning key materials and advertising were translated and support was available in each language. Seattle worked with ten community-based organizations, conducting or attending 276 outreach events, including candidate forums, cultural events, and leadership group meetings, in order to access “hard-to-reach communities.” Seattle also worked with community groups to craft messaging to underrepresented communities, such as adopting edits from several groups to the non-citizen voucher application form.Participant Recruitment and SelectionFor donorsAny legal resident of Seattle who is at least 18 years old can receive and use democracy vouchers. Registered voters receive vouchers automatically in the mail, since their addresses are on file with the city. Other eligible voucher users can apply to receive vouchers (either physically or digitally).For candidatesCandidates can choose to opt-in to the democracy vouchers program (thus being allowed to accept vouchers, but also being held to extra program rules), or to opt-out (and run their campaign under the old system). To opt-in, candidates must raise a requisite number of small contributions to signal the seriousness of their candidacy, and must sign a document agreeing to comply with program rules.  Candidates who opt-in can still receive private contributions, though contribution limits are decreased for voucher candidates in some races. Voucher candidates also face aggregate limits on their campaign spending, and are required to participate in public debates.Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsSeattle's program had two official goals: increase the number of donors, and increase the number of candidates. Both goals were achieved. In 2017, Seattle saw a 300% increase in the number of donors. In 2019, the number of donors again more than doubled. Further, more candidates, and more diverse candidates, have started to run and win. For example, after the 2021 election, Seattle will have its first person of color as mayor (both finalists for mayor are people of color, and both opted-in to the democracy vouchers program).  Further, donors are now more diverse across race, income, and age. Prior to democracy vouchers, Seattle donors were overwhelmingly  wealthy, white, and had houses with views of the water . With vouchers. Today, Seattle's donors are reflective of Seattle as a whole.Analysis and Lessons LearnedWhen every voter is a potential $100 donor, candidates are incentivized to talk to as many people as possible rather than prioritizing call time with the wealthy few. In individual conversations, many voters report that their doors had never been knocked on by a candidate before democracy vouchers went in place.  Studies show that those who use vouchers become substantially more likely to vote. One study found that low propensity voters who used vouchers were 7.4 times more likely to vote in 2017, and that non-voters who used their vouchers were 10.2 times more likely to vote. Thus, beyond just where campaign dollars come from, using democracy vouchers to incentivize candidates to talk to as many people as possible is a very effective means of boosting voter turnout and political engagement.

According to the World Vision survey in 2004, 40 percent of Liberian women were subjected to sexual violence during the civil wars.  [1]    In post-war Liberia, trauma has affected development as well as communal relations in all ramifications. Therefore, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) of Liberia was established to ensure healing, peace, and reconciliation.In fulfilling the objectives of the TRC of Liberia, the Palava Hut System was formed based on the premise that “sustainable peace in Liberia cannot merely be based on the absence of war, but should be measured by how secure, safe and peaceful Liberians feel.”  [2]Thus, the Palava Hut system achieves its purpose by providing a forum for free expression and interaction.Origins and DevelopmentIn 2009, the Palava Hut system was published as one of the 142 recommendations of the TRC of Liberia, which is a Parliament-enacted organization that provided a conducive environment for constructive interchange between victims and perpetrators of human violations and armed conflicts in Liberia to recommend mechanisms for healing. On October 19, 2013, the Palava Hut program was officially launched by the then-President of Liberia, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, which offered the first publicly available comprehensive mapping of human rights violations, discussion of economic crimes, and the exploitation of resources as a principal source of conflict, and the protection of vulnerable populations.The traditional Palava Hut process existed in pre-settler Liberia as a “reconciliatory dispute resolution mechanism convened by elders to settle community matters such as extramarital affairs, divorces, land disputes, debt, and occasionally theft and murder.”  [3]How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-MakingThe Palava Hut system is based on traditional dispute resolution mechanisms for justice and national reconciliation. In its traditional form, the perpetrator or accused confesses, apologizes for the wrong committed, and seeks forgiveness from the victim. It fosters peacebuilding, healing, and national reconciliation at both the national and district levels. Anyone who has committed a crime (intentionally or not) against an individual, group, or the state is eligible for pardon or forgiveness provided the accused affirms the crime committed. Subsequently, cleansing rituals and restitution are carried out to complete the process.  [4]Failure to adhere to the Palava Hut system could result in dire consequences such as public sanctions, debarment from holding public office, lustrations, and criminal and civil prosecution.  [5]  Anyone who has committed (intentionally or not) a crime against an individual, group, or the state is eligible for pardon or forgiveness provided the accused affirms the crime committed. The participants include victims, perpetrators (including warlords, financiers, organizers), and witnesses. The hearings entail statement taking, vetting of witnesses, and professional psychological support (before and after the hearings). In statement taking process, the concerned parties recount their experiences either as victims or perpetrators. A vetting process of witnesses follows this to ensure transparency. The hearing is overseen by traditional elders and community leaders guided by the INCHR. The accused or perpetrator acknowledges wrongdoing, seeks forgiveness from the victim, and all parties embark on healing and reconciliation. In essence, it “aims to bridge the divide by gradually addressing sources of conflicts within Liberia’s beginning, this form of accountability, tends to focus on the future rather than past wrongs, and centres mainly on state- and institution-building.”  [6]The Independent National Commission on Human Rights (INCHR) manages the Palava Hut System with support from United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Liberia office. A Palava-Hut Committee is set up in Liberia’s sixty-four districts to ease accessibility and participation and provide a platform for healing, reintegration, and reconciliation.  [7]   It is limited to public sanctions for supporting warring groups, factions, and lesser crimes only (lesser than gross violations as stated by the Liberian TRC). Its jurisdiction excluded those prosecuted for international crimes. However, a recommendation in favor of anyone accused of a high crime or gross human rights violations can be made to the Head of State or equivalent court. The lesser crimes are but are not limited to assaults, arson, destruction of property, forced displacement, looting, robbery, and extortion.Analysis and Lessons LearnedThe victim’s confrontation with perpetrators could be considered a mentally taxing process, especially for victims who have struggled with their experiences at the hands of their perpetrators. In some cases, the psychological consequences of this system have been oversimplified. As a result, some Liberians have rejected the system and decided against reliving the traumatic experiences evident in declarations such as “We don’t want to explain it to anyone again; we don’t want the memory to come back.”  [8]While the motive behind this system is commendable, its impacts have been limited due to financial constraints. In 2013, Joseph Blamiyon, the Coordinator of the Palava Hut Program at the Independent National Commission on Human Rights (INCHR), called for an increase in budget allocation to complete its activities effectively.  [9]  However, the Palava Hut system has been commended for bringing “closure to victims and provid[ing] a space for people, families, and communities.” [10] References[1 ]  Tamasin Ford, “Wronged women of Liberia reluctant to revisit human rights abuses,”February 28, 2021,The Guardian,  https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/feb/28/liberia-women-reluctant-to-relive-abuse  .[2]Priyal Singh and Lesley Connolly “The Road to Reconciliation: A Case Study of Liberia’s Reconciliation Roadmap,” June 2014,  Accord,  https://www.accord.org.za/publication/road-to-reconciliation/  .[3]  Elijah Pajito,  Traditional Justice Mechanisms: The Liberian Case.

At its extremes, this has included genocide, slavery, and the colonization of Indigenous peoples.  [1]The history of some societies features racial injustices that involve gross human violations and armed conflicts. This has resulted in both physical and mental harm, the destruction of properties, and death, which has created rifts or disunity between parties involved and subsequently hindered the growth of citizens and the development of societies. Also, “the effects of historical trauma are intergenerationally transmitted even as the structural mechanisms that created them remain in place, creating a plurality of disadvantage for present-day generations.”  [2]The impact of racial injustices impedes development in societies. As a result, the influence of TRCs cannot be undermined in addressing the historical legacy of racial injustice and finding ways to move forward. TRCs as global human rights interventions seek to transform communities affected by oppression and violence through restorative justice principles.  [3]The main objective of TRCs is to foster reconciliation rather than retributive justice and is therefore different from a court-like structure that emphasizes punishment.Origins and DevelopmentSince the first well-known TRC in Argentina in 1983, TRCs have been conducted in various forms across various continents. Over fifty TRCs are recorded as of today.  In 1995, The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa was identified as the first commission to hold public hearings in which both victims and perpetrators were heard. [4]TRCs have since been internationally acclaimed as an innovative model for building peace and fostering the accountability of actors involved in human rights violations.Participant Recruitment and SelectionEvery TRC has a unique participant selection and recruitment process. The selection and number of participants are dependent upon the case being treated (historical event of human violations and violence) and the location. Three groups are typically involved: victims, perpetrators, and the government. The perpetrators are classified into one of four categories: individual perpetrators, group perpetrators, corporate perpetrators, and government perpetrators.The activities of TRCs are guided and directed by Commissioners selected through an open countrywide nomination process and publicly interviewed by an independent selection panel comprising of representatives of the government, civil societies, and religious bodies. They delegate researchers, investigators, and statement-takers to help collect extensive, detailed information from victims, perpetrators, and witnesses.In sharing their experiences and roles within the historical event, these groups typically engage in interviews, provide statements, and offer evidence. To ease communication, testifiers are often permitted to communicate in the language most convenient for them.How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-MakingThe TRC process takes place within a minimum of one year but is subject to extension based on commissioners’ requests. The process entails uncovering the truth, identifying the culprits, analyzing the extent of abuses, and fostering new methods of healing and reconciliation. The crimes considered are classified into three categories: Egregious Domestic Crimes, Gross Violations of Human Rights Law, or Serious Humanitarian Law Violations. Some of the Egregious Domestic Crimes include sexual assault, fraud, murder, misappropriation of public funds, and kidnapping. In most cases, the Gross Violations of Human Rights Law committed by state actors include enslavement, genocide, torture, sexual slavery, unlawful prosecution, and imprisonment. Lastly, Serious Humanitarian Law Violations include mutilation, hostage-taking, terrorism, illegal executions, child labor, cruel treatment, and torture.This commences with information-gathering through interviews and statement-taking by victims, perpetrators, and witnesses, followed by individual and thematic hearings. Counseling and psychological aid are accessible before, during, and after the hearings. Likewise, protective measures are typically taken to conceal children's identities, such as the absence of media or video coverage. A witness protection program is set up to handle trauma, stigmatization, neglect, shame, ostracization, and possible threats to life.The next step entails the investigation and validation of testimonies by the Inquiry Unit. Not limited to this, this truth-seeking process involves the research of data from various sources. This ensures the construction of an impartial historical record of the past and aids in drafting a reparations policy.The perpetrators typically discuss their involvement in the atrocities by recounting human rights violations and seeking the forgiveness of victims. In most cases, the offer of amnesty to perpetrators increases truthful recollections and testimonies and promotes openness and transparency. This process offers an avenue of healing for victims.A TRC's final task involves the release of a final report, including recommendations to sustain unity, peace, reconciliation, and prevent a re-occurrence of past events. As democratic innovations, TRCs tackle human rights violations by highlighting the causes and proffering recommendations to aid reconciliation and peaceful co-existence among all parties involved.Analysis and Lessons LearnedThe widely-acclaimed acceptance and presence of TRCs in various societies can be attributed to the methods of healing that they promote. They ensure that their actions are guided by a final objective of “investigating, identifying the antecedents and determining responsibility for egregious domestic crimes, gross human rights violations, and serious humanitarian law violations.”  [5]TRCs have historically been faulted for rehashing the trauma of victims, which has psychological and emotional impacts. Some victims prefer to avoid recounting their gruesome experiences. Also, the level of influence of a TRC is restricted by different bureaucratic processes in various countries. In some cases, TRCs’ influences conclude at the release of a final report without the opportunity to implement the recommendations provided in the report. This is otherwise known as “TRC calls to action,” which, as the name suggests, tasks the government to implement recommendations to offer lasting solutions to the issues raised.The shortcomings of TRCs do not diminish their importance in eliciting “admissions of wrongdoing and public apologies and tangible steps towards a more equitable community.”  [6]  The prevalence of horrific human violations, racial injustice, and armed conflicts affirms the need for TRCs. That is, “as long as unresolved historic injustices continue to fester in the world, there will be a demand for truth commissions.”  [7]See AlsoTruth and Reconciliation Commission of LiberiaReferences[1]  Maria Svetaz et al, “The Traumatic Impact of Racism and Discrimination On Young People and How To Talk About It,” in  Reaching Teens: Strength-Based, Trauma0Sensitive, Resilience-Building Communication Strategies Rooted In The Positive Youth Development  by Kenneth Ginsburg and Zachary McClain (Eds.)https://www.seattlechildrens.org/globalassets/documents/clinics/diversity/the-traumatic-impact-of-racism-and-discrimination-on-young-people-and-how-to-talk-about-it.pdf[2] Ibid.[3]David Androff, “A case study of a grassroots truth and reconciliation commission from a community practice perspective,”  Journal of Social Work(2016),Vol. 18(3) 273–287  ,https://doi-org.libaccess.lib.mcmaster.ca/10.1177/1468017316654361[4]Desmond Tutu, “Truth and Reconciliation Commission, South Africa,”https://www.britannica.com/topic/Truth-and-Reconciliation-Commission-South-Africa[5]  “ Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Liberia,” Vol I: Findings and Determinations, 25.

Works efficiently for large groups and dozens of ideas to find the ‘wisdom of the crowd’ with immediate transparent results, without relying on mobile devices.[See 1 minute video]Origins and DevelopmentFeedback Frames were invented in 2014 by Jason Diceman, a then Senior Public Consultation Coordinate for the City of Toronto. He created the tool as a solution to theproblems he saw in sticker dot-voting (dotmocracy)  . After years of prototype use within his own professional work, he began manufacturing and distribution of Feedback Frames in 2018. They are now in use by government bodies and by professional facilitators around the world.The approach is based on score voting,and the likert scale, which have been proven effective in social science research since the 1950s. Also based on the “Gradients of Agreement Scale” developed in 1987 by Sam Kaner et al.  In  2004, Jason created an earlier version of the approach using pen to fill in dots on a scale of agreement in a paper form, originally called “Dotmocracy Sheets” and later “Idea Rating Sheets”.How it Works[See 1 minute video]Feedback Frames are a secret score-voting ballot tool where participants vote by dropping tokens in a range of slots that are hidden by a cover, with results later revealed as a visual graph of opinions. See photos and video attached and atFeedbackFrames.comFeedback Framescan be used at any stage of a participatory session, when there is a need to prioritize statements, such as:Questions to be answeredTopics to be exploredProposals to be recommendedConcerns to be addressedSuggestions to be consideredRating scales and other materials can be easily customized for the specific language, topic and goals of the meeting. (See the library of free templates atFeedbackFrames.com/templates  )For example the standard rating scale provided is:Strong AgreementAgreementNeutralDisagreementStrong Disagreement? - Not SureThis prioritization technique can be used among a list of predetermined options, or following an participant idea generation process (e.g. brainstorm).The technique scales up to allow for the rating of dozens of ideas at a time. While each frame only holds about 30 votes, it can still be used within a meeting of 100+ participants, as long as each frame receives a fair sample of voters. Ideas can also be duplicated across multiple frames for a larger sample.The process requires between 30 minutes to an hour, including instructions, voting &amp; commenting, and a review of the results.Results may be used immediately in the next step of a meeting agenda, and/or recorded for sharing and consideration after the event.Step-by-Step Instructions(See photos above.  For more detailed facilitation instructions, seeFeedbackFrames.com/resources  )1. Ideas written on statement-signature sheetsPredetermined options and/or participant generated suggestions are written on statement-signature sheets (see template at FeedbackFrames.com/templates).Each sheet contains only one idea each.2. Place sheets in front of Feedback FramesLay out the statement-signature sheets with statements on them in front of Feedback Frames set-out on tables.3. Invite token dropping to rate ideasFor each idea, participants will silently read a statement and privately record their rating by dropping one single token in the corresponding frame along the scale provided.They should also sign their name or initials on the right of each statement-signature sheet they vote on.Signatures track progress and will validate results by matching the number of tokens dropped per frame.Optionally, they can also write comments on each sheet under the headings “Strengths &amp; Opportunities”, or “Concerns &amp; Weaknesses”.4. Reveal the resultsOnce voting is sufficiently complete, it’s then time for the big reveal to “see what we think!”Reveals can generally be done all at once for efficiency, or one at a time for more suspense and rousing group reactions.5. Record results as photos and token countsOutside of the meeting agenda, a facilitator-assistant will photograph each individual frame result with its statement-signature sheet.They will also write the token count for each column in pen at the bottom of each sheet.6. Enter results data into a spreadsheet (optional)If a session includes more than a dozen results, or if there is need to compile and compare results from multiple sessions, one can type up the statements, comments and token results into a digital spreadsheet.A simple formula can score each idea and then automatically sort by level of agreement.Add columns for themes and topics to help with analysis.

Analysis methods specially adapted to target setting, action planning and solution sketching are used in the evaluation. Characteristic of the variant is, on the one hand, the use of mini-workshops (“remote phase”) as the primary means of communication, and on the other hand, the use of debate and role-play formats.As with every insights process, results of a deliberative Delphi are findings. A cognition can take the form of a concrete individual reference to the solution of a problem or a task or it can consist of a comprehensive picture that shows the solution components in context. With the focus on knowledge, a Deliberative Delphi differs significantly from opinion polls, where the amount and proportion of votes cast are relevant for decision-making. On the other hand, the Deliberative Delphi also differs from participation formats in which groups of participants work out solutions together and by consensus. In a Deliberative Delphi, instead, participants contribute pieces of a puzzle to solve a problem or a problem. Participation takes place here in the mode of participation or contribution. For those involved, but also for outsiders, it is transparent to understand which contributions the final findings are based on.How it works: Brief instructions in six modulesThe selection or recruitment of participants precedes the actual process. These constitute the project group. Ideally, this should be a group of 15 to 25 people.1. Kick-offThe process starts with a face-to-face event in the form of a creative workshop. During the workshop, the project group familiarizes itself with the topic and sets priorities for the subsequent remote phase.2. Remote phaseDuring the subsequent multi-week remote phase, the moderation team conducts repeated mini-workshops with members of the project group. As a basis for discussion in the mini-workshops, the moderators create editorial content and process research assignments from the participants. Debate and role-play formats are used, such as the presentation of information in a positioned form, i.e. as pro and contra contributions. The aim of these formats is above all to address the participants emotionally and thus to motivate them more in terms of content. Another goal is debiasing, that is, the avoidance or reduction of cognitive distortions such as the myside bias. This leads to the fact that, above all, information is perceived and processed, which confirms one&#39;s own preconceived opinion.In addition to two moderators: inside (or one moderator: in and one representative: in the participating instance), two to four, a maximum of five guests take part in each mini-workshop. The workshop lasts one hour.In terms of content, the mini-workshops are designed as key question interviews. The same key questions are used for every workshop on a given topic. The key questions take the participation question from online participation, vary the wording and go into detail. The workshops are moderated in such a way that, overall, they have more of the character of a conversation and a mutual exchange than that of an interview.The participants&#39; contributions are recorded as transcripts. This is done in the form of stylized, i.e. modeled, quotations that get to the heart of the content of an article as closely as possible. The quotations are not identified by name.Workshop protocols summarize the results from the entire project group. Before a new round of workshops starts, the members of the project group receive the interim results for inspection.A quantitative survey of the project group can also take place at the beginning or at the end of each workshop round - either in the mini-workshops or as a written survey.3. Analysis, first step: Isolation of key messagesIn the course of the analysis, the moderators isolate individual key statements from the participants&#39; answers. Key messages are traditionally up to 200 characters long (including spaces). This is done with the help of the digital Insights platform or a relevant software for qualitative content analysis (see below, tips and stumbling blocks). Ideally, the corresponding software should make it possible not only to mark passages within a text (and to assign categories, see stept “Clustering”), but also to comment on the marked passage with a freely selectable text (which then constitutes the core message). It is important that at the end of the day it is possible to be able to call up the corresponding passage in the original article from the individual core statement.4. Analysis, second step: clusteringThe key messages are now clustered inside by the moderators, that is, arranged in groups. The grouping is mostly done inductively: Instead of starting from a given scheme, the categories are developed and adapted  on the go.  There are no generally applicable guidelines for clustering. It is often useful to use relevant problem structuring categories (such as “problem” and “solution”). In most cases, however, it makes sense to develop the categories from the content of the topic.As with the formation of the core statements, clustering is also carried out with software support. For more sophisticated analyzes, ideally Insights software or common tools for qualitative content analysis are used. In the case of extensive consultations, it is advisable to use software that supports the analysis through keyword searches or artificial intelligence processes.5. Analysis, third step: Forming insightsThe results of the clustering are the basis for the final findings. In the simplest case, a finding is a summary of participant contributions for a specific category. However, the moderator should endeavor to clearly differentiate findings from the reproduction of mere opinions and not necessarily treat opinions expressed in the consultation as facts. If opinions that are clearly recognizable as such are involved, then these can, for example, become a realization that they are interpreted as information about different needs and wishes within a target group or are read as a summary of which ideas or arguments are at least prima facie for worth considering. Findings can also consist in the fact that participants contribute detailed knowledge in their contributions that was not previously known or not sufficiently taken into account beforehand.As with the creation of the categories, when formulating findings it is also advisable to work with relevant problem structuring methods, such as &quot;problem / solution&quot; or &quot;pro / contra&quot;. In this way the individual knowledge can be given an internal structure.___________________________________________________________________________________________Example  :Answer:&quot;All administrative procedures should be possible digitally: identification via webcam, payment via mobile phone or online, eg a) confirmations such as life certificates, etc., b.) Driver&#39;s license and passport; c.) Dealing with the district court (land register, etc.) It would also be desirable to have a chat facility for questions such as is already offered by banks today. - Invoices such as those for kindergarten via email instead of paper. - Module changes for the kindergarten. - School registrations and requests to change areas in digital form. - Confirmations of residence. There are countless possibilities here to make the system more efficient, to conserve resources and ultimately to make processes faster.Core statements isolated from this:Dealing with authorities should be made possible digitally through identification via webcam, payment via mobile phone or onlineLife certificate, driver&#39;s license and passport, errands at the district court (land register, etc.), confirmations of residence, school registrations, requests to change areas, module changes for the kindergartenAssigned To: Finding 1:DIGITAL OFFICIAL ROUTES OF THE CITY F.In order to avoid unnecessary official visits, applications, registrations, etc. should be able to be processed online in the future.

The report will be published before thePublication coordinated with the participants.TipsIn both the kickoff event and the mini-workshops, it is often a good idea to involve the participants in small games. A selection of games, some of which are suitable for the purposes of a Deliberative Delphis Process, is available from gamestorming.comMind mapping is a solution for creating and clustering key messages, which is particularly suitable for workshops. If you use a mind mapping software in the &quot;Concept Mapping&quot; mode, the core statements can be represented by individual nodes, while the associated original contributions are created as (hidden) notes on these nodes. In asynchronous settings, it is advisable to use tools that have been developed for the purpose of so-called qualitative content analysis and that have features to simulate the process of creating core statements.Problem structuring methods can be used both to find a good question and to structure findings.There are so-called Kanbans for many thematic occasions. A selection of these can be found in the following toolkid from the UK innovation agency Nesta:  http://gonano-project.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DIY-Toolkit-Full-Download-A4-Size.pdfThe moderation manual by Wagner, H., Seifert, JW, &amp; Flockenhaus, U.

Sense and purposeThe Deliberative Delphi is an instrument to benefit from the so-called “wisdom of the many”. In contrast to the classic approach of the wisdom of the many, which is based on the evaluation of quantitative information (namely the averaging), qualitative information is processed in a deliberative Delphi.Concrete results of a Deliberative Delphi can consist of the following elements:Survey of deliberative attitudesCollection and analysis (coding / clustering) of arguments put forwardPrioritization of fields of action by participantsMultivariate analysis of response sequences: Are there recognizable patterns in how participants answer a sequence of questions?Plausibility check of argumentsEvaluation of prima facie arguments vs. all-in-all-considered evaluations; Development of criteria for weighing up competing decision-making principlesAnalysis of extremes in consensus or dissent when evaluating arguments as an indicator of uncertainty in factual judgmentPlausibility assessment for future scenarios or estimation questions (keyword &quot;wisdom of the many&quot;)Co-creation of products and processesExamplesBürgerdelphi germ line therapy: pattern in Anword sequencesAt the Bürgerdelphi germline therapy (Buedeka), participants formed an opinion on the legal regulation of germline therapy. Germ line therapy (which is carried out on the unborn embryo) is characterized by the fact that it has effects for later generations. These can be desired effects (such as the repair of hereditary diseases) or unforeseen undesirable effects. One question related to the regulation of basic research in Germany. The question was: Should it be possible for scientists in Germany to take part in basic research on germ line therapy?15 out of 20 participants (75 percent) were in favor of enabling basic research on germ line therapy in Germany as well. The reasons given for the decision are interesting. This shows an interesting pattern in the response sequences. It can be seen that participants who differ on other points of opinion nevertheless come together in their opinion on the regulation of basic research - which indicates an interesting scope for possible compromises:“Research will advance, if it is banned in Germany, then in other countries. And it would be a great shame if neither as a scientist nor as a legislator could have any influence on it. It is better to allow basic research to be controlled and subject to certain conditions than that it takes place somewhere in secret. &quot;“Germ line therapy is an opportunity to cure the most serious hereditary diseases such as cystic fibrosis. The known risks can be controlled sufficiently well within the framework of the existing legal system. A ban on basic research would be disproportionate. &quot;KIRA: co-creationIn the KIRA project (a consultation of stakeholders and experts on artificial intelligence in radiology - using the example of diagnosis, image analysis and recommended therapy for cardiac symptoms), participants in co-creation outlined solutions for previously identified problems. One set of solutions concerned the informed decision problem. An informed decision in a medical context means that patient values are included in the choice of diagnostic procedures and therapies. As part of the Citizens Delphi, three different approaches for the informed development were proposed and worked out in sketch form:Variant A: The AI system supports the doctor in choosing a diagnostic procedure, in which the AI system provides objective probability figures for the risks of the diagnostic procedure, for the further development of the course of the disease and treatment opportunities. Doctors can share these numbers with patients.Variant B: The AI system supports medical staff in communicating with patients so that decisions can be made based on their personal preferences (which are previously recorded).Variant C: The AI system directly supports patients in making independent decisions.Citizen Delphi Health Data: Balancing Competing Decision-Making PrinciplesAt the Citizens Delphi Health Data, participants developed a position on the question of whether health data stored on the electronic patient record (EPR) should be freely available in a hypothetical scenario of health research - in the form that patients who do not want this should be active have to contradict. Such a solution is known as an “opt-out” model.In general, the participants are open to the possibility of providing their health data from the ePA to research without exception. A large part of the participants also advocated use by research-based pharmaceutical companies. Nevertheless, the majority of the participants spoke out against the legal introduction of an opt-out solution. What was particularly striking was the observation that the participants spoke out against an objection solution and against the abolition of earmarking even if they expected medical data to be used in scientific and medical research speed up the step, and if they assessed that a change from an approval to an objection solution (i.e. from opt-in to opt-out) would significantly improve data availability. Reasons for this attitude are presented in detail by the participants in an argumentative manner. They underline the need for a solution that balances the competing values of individual freedom and social benefit.Appendix:Method comparison: what is the difference between the Deliberative Delphi and a Citizens&#39; Council?In contrast to the Citizens&#39; Council, in which a group of participants (usually determined by lot) come together in plenary for a time slot of a weekend or several day sessions, the participants in the Deliberative Delphi work together in alternating members in mini-workshops that have one Be carried out for a period of several months.In addition, the two methods differ in terms of how they work together. While citizens&#39; council procedures use the mode of joint action (collaboration), the deliberative Delphi predominantly takes place in the mode of participation (contribution). In collaboration, the results of team members and participants are largely developed independently; the moderator only takes responsibility for process design and time management. With the contribution, the degree of participation is lower. In the deliberative Delphi, participants decide (in contrast to a pure survey) about the setting of the topic and about final decisions and positions. The analysis of the participants&#39; contributions and the editing of the results report is carried out by the moderation team. The incentive economy is different in cooperation in the mode of participation than in the mode of joint action. Working together is based on mutual achievement. As soon as reciprocity is interrupted, teamwork comes to a standstill. In the mode of participation, on the other hand, the team members switch to the role of advisors and supporters who voluntarily provide their expertise.The results also differed accordingly. While the participants in a Citizens&#39; Delphi usually reach a decision by consensus, the Deliberative Delphi goes deeper into the content. As a result, it is not the formation of opinions within the group that counts here, but the gathering of arguments and the detailed elaboration of ideas (see above, Why a Deliberative Delphi?).",1,0,0,0,0,
8040,method,InterGenerational Dialogues,https://participedia.net/method/8040,InterGenerational Dialogues was a series of events created to host conversations between individuals over 65 and high schoolers. Each event offered a different topic for the groups to discuss to foster enhanced communication and shared understanding between the generations. ,0,2022-03-09,2022-03-10,422192,liliyajl,https://participedia.net/user/422192,422192,liliyajl,https://participedia.net/user/422192,en,1,both,,limited,stratified,low,low,deliberative, informal,,,,,,,,discussion, storytelling, ask,,,,,,,,," Problems and Purpose  In an ever-increasingly technological world with the ability to talk with someone on the other side of the globe, one would think that our communication would also be enhanced with these new channels. However, while the younger generations, Generation Z especially, who have grown up with this new technology have seemingly taken to it with ease, older generations still struggle to understand it. With this struggle to understand ever-changing technology has come the belief that people are not connecting the way they used to before phones and such were invented. This difference in understanding has caused an even wider gap of communication between individuals of Generation Z and individuals their grandparents’ age.InterGenerational Dialogues was conceived to help bridge this gap between generations and to encourage people to connect with those around them. In response to hearing about her grandfather’s experience with social isolation during rehabilitation, co-founder Delaney McNally’s created InterGenerational Dialogues to foster connections and bring people together [ 1 ]  Origins and Development  InterGenerational Dialogues was born out of a partnership between multiple Delaney’s organization Generation Connect, the Partnership for Age-Friendly Communities (PAFC) [ 2] , and the Center for Public Deliberation (CPD) [ 3 ]. The first event was offered in Spring 2019 with following events continuing to be offered as of this writing, including specialized events that focus on specific social identites, such as GenHerous's women only events.While InterGenerational Dialogues debuted in 2019, PAFC had been working since 2016 to present events for older residents to bridge the communication gap. Offered events included panels in the Fort Collins, CO area with panelists holding identities from multiple backgrounds and generations to talk and compare differences in life experiences across generations. In 2019, the CPD became involved in the process, and its director, Martín Carcasson, acted as a glue that connected the multiple organizations as they collaborated to present InterGen.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  While the ultimate goal of these dialogues was ultimately to help bridge the communication gap between generations, the focus was specifically on mending the divide between high school students and individuals in Delaney’s grandfather’s generation or older. Thus, the participant recruitment was heavily targeted towards those who fit such criteria.  For the younger half of the participant pool, Delaney utilized her connections within her high school and word of mouth to recruit attendees, including through the student council and other student organizations. When asked, Delaney stated that as a high schooler herself, she thought that high school was an appropriate age for such conversations and that they had not considered younger students at the time due to a potential lack of maturity required for such topics [4]. As for the older half of the participant pool, PAFC worked with multiple organizations in Larimer County to gather attendees. [5] They worked with senior centers, libraries, and other such organizations that catered towards the aging community. With the CPD involved, the attendee list grew to include CSU’s students and other college-age individuals who had heard of the event as the CPD provided trained student facilitators through its program.  Despite the specific age limitations for participants, the recruitment was open to the public and anyone who met those age requirements was welcome.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Rather than each individual event building on the last to culminate in a large project, the events tended to be considered complete alone and participants would receive a complete experience if they only attended one event. The overall umbrella of InterGenerational Dialogues fosters understanding and improved communication between participants, and each event focused on a specific topic rather than on generational disconnect as a whole. Some of the events done include “Life in the Time of Corona,” “Expanding Empathy,” and “Listening Courageously” [ 6 ].These topics were chosen by Generation Connect with input from the CPD and PAFC with regards to what was considered relevant and interesting to high school students at the time.After topics were chosen, Dr. Carcasson and the CPD would work to create facilitation guides that would help direct the conversations. These guides were similar in structure to a National Issues Forum placemat, but rather than multiple approaches to an option, they offered potential questions of interest should the conversation become static [ 7 ]. As previously mentioned, the CPD also provided facilitators at every event to further foster improved communication between participants. However, as the events were more informal dialogues rather than decision-making discussions, they were informed ahead of time that they had the opportunity to provide their own input into the conversation, unlike more formal discussions where they would be impartial.For in-person events, the settings were usually high schools or senior centers when possible. In addition, the setups would be multiple smaller roundtables for each group with a basket in the middle for all cellular devices. Once there, participants were allotted to the roundtables of around six participants each with both demographics represented as equally as possible. In addition to the participants, there would be around one or two CPD student facilitators at each table to help guide the conversation. There would then be an introduction speech on why the specific topic for that event was chosen and ground rules for the conversations would be shared, such as all cell phones being put on silent and put into the basket in the middle of the table. Then the groups would be free to discuss. As the events were dialogue-centered rather than having decision-making or informative purpose, storytelling and asking and answering questions were the main processes of communication.Once things moved to mainly online modes of communication, instead of being taken to different tables, participants would be put into different breakrooms. However, the same division of participants was applied for online events and events would unfold very similarly.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  As the ultimate goals of this method of engagement were dialogic, there were not many immediate outcomes from the events. However, participants did express that they felt they had developed better understandings with others from the opposite generation.[6] They also expressed that they felt they had built bridges and improved their ability to listen carefully to other points of view from their own. They noted that they felt like they were combatting social isolation and loneliness through truly connecting with others.This was also observed through the fact that many participants continued to return and attend multiple sessions after their first.These InterGenerational Dialogues seemed to receive such a positive reception that there was even a subcategory of conversations called GenHerous, which highlighted issues specifically impacting women. There is a separate entry on Participedia which focuses on one such GenHerous event.Analysis and Lessons Learned  When asked, Delaney noted that one lesson learned was that providing incentives to attend may change how people participated at the event. She noted that some of the teachers at her high school when they heard about the events offered their students extra credit, an outside incentive, for attending [4].This brought with it the question of how an extra incentive in addition to the dialogues and improved communication across generations impacted participant experience and expectations. For future events, it may be one aspect of the event to consider.  In addition, when turning to online formats when in-person was unavailable, it should be noted to expect lower attendance and perhaps even lower quality participation. While online conversations still fostered connection and improved understanding across generations, the technical aspects were a new aspect to consider. Participation did see a decrease, and it was more dificult to do group activities. However, these aspects and logisitics were something to consider when planning, not complete deterrents.See Also  References  [1] Fleskes, Austin. “Five Questions: Delaney McNally Carries on Young Life of Volunteering, Leadership.”  Herald , Loveland Reporter-Herald, 26 July 2021, https://www.reporterherald.com/2021/07/25/five-questions-delaney-mcnally-carries-on-young-life-of-volunteering-leadership/?fbclid=IwAR0me0i4F9undqrmQVcOqeY2aqGyJWjBTnGRoVtnsNOjvyxJx6VZ9aw-I0s.

As  Kei Nishiyama points out ;Conventionally, a lecture on democracy would begin by introducing the concept of democracy, drawing on its philosophical foundations. This would be followed by historic cases of democracy. However, the key to understanding the ‘texture of democracy’, asGagnon suggests, lies in understanding the diversity of conceptions and languages used to express it. Thus, learning democracy should start from the bottom up.This is the starting point of Democracy Lab: the recognition of diverse conceptions of democracy. Democracy Lab starts this conversations with students not by  telling  them what democracy is, but by  asking what it means to them.The secondary aim of Democracy Lab is to demystify and break down the writing process through a supported process of reading, note taking and collaborative writing. It aims to foster the following skills:critical thinking  independent research  reflection  note taking  synthesising sources  collaborative writingOrigins and DevelopmentDemocracy Lab was developed by deliberative democracy scholar and Participedia co-investigator  Lucy J Parry . After being invited to talk to students about democracy at a high school in Northern Italy, Lucy wanted to find a way to introduce Participedia and the notion of democratic innovations to inspire students and explore an angle of democracy that would likely be unfamiliar to them.  She was also inspired by a series of articles in  The Loop, an academic blog, on the science of democracy . This series advances discussions on varieties, values and threats to democracy. Lucy decided to use some of these 'big questions' in the field as an entry point for introducing and studying democratic innovations in practice. This approach reflects her own work which combines political theory and empirical social science research.  As a former teacher of academic writing, it was also important to introduce students to the ideas of independent study, research and writing - a task which many undergraduate students struggle with. Therefore, a collaborative writing exercise was included in the second workshop to build these skills and equip students with the confidence to start an academic assignment.Participant Recruitment and SelectionParticipants in the Democracy Lab would generally be students around the final year of high school. In the first application of this method, these were students in a civic education class in Northern Italy. The sessions should be supported by the teachers in the class to facilitate especially the research task in between sessions.How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-MakingDemocracy Lab is a two part workshop that takes place online. It uses a  Miro board  to facilitate note taking and discussion. Other platforms can probably be used to do this and there is nothing inherent in Miro's features that are necessary.Democracy Lab IPrior to the first session, the Miro board needs to be set up ready. This first session covers three main questions, outlined below. Each question should be presented in a Miro frame, with a supply of sticky notes for students to write their answers on. First, whoever is leading the session should give a brief introduction and outline how the session will work. The emphasis is not on giving a lecture or a talk but on the co-production of knowledge, as students and teachers are invited to define democracy themselves. There are no right or wrong answers, and it should be made clear that critical responses are also welcomed - not everybody might think democracy has value and it's important everybody can express their view.  A set amount of time is given for each question, followed by a group discussion of what has been written on the sticky notes. The amount of time given can vary according to lesson times and what the class can offer, however, it should be taken into consideration that this first session covers quite some ground and might involve some thinking on topics and at a depth that participants are not used to. It's important that it is not rushed, and also that there is time for students to ask questions throughout and when they want to - there is no set Q&amp;A time as the conversation flows more organically. Students are also encouraged to use the chat function as well as speaking out loud, to maximise forms of participation that people are comfortable with. Miro has a built-in timer and music if desired.QuestionsWhat is democracy and what is its value?  What threatens democracy these days?  What does it mean to participate in democracy?For each question, an image and a link offer a bit more information on the question from an unexpected perspective to prompt some reflection.  After all three questions have been answered, the final part of the first session starts from students responses to question 3 on participation, to introduce the concept of democratic innovations and Participedia. A very brief outline of democratic innovations is given (really just a few minutes) before diving into the site. To some extent, this cannot be precisely planned because it depends how students respond to the question. They might only mention voting, or they might suggest things like public debates and so on. Lucy's overview of democratic innovations mentions:democracy is more than voting  the where of democracy - beyond governments, in public spaces, in our schools, homes  democratic innovations as new forms of citizen participation  some concrete examples from Participedia (e.g. participatory budgeting, participatory arts, citizens assemblies)  some of the benefits and critiques of these processesThe final part is to introduce the task that students will do in between the first and second session. A frame on Miro outlines this with clear written instructions, and the facilitator should explain it clearly as well with time for questions. The students' task is to explore Participedia (show them briefly how to navigate the site) and find a case that they find interesting. They should read the case and then revisit the original three questions in light of this new information. In addition, they can consider the question 'if and how democratic innovations can help address threats to democracy'.  On the frame, space is reserved with sticky notes for them to share their findings. At this stage, they only need to make short notes so this is not too taxing. Also on the frame are links to some examples to get them started; they may use these or do their own research. In the Italian case, Lucy linked to all the Italian cases on Participedia. Check in advance if the students' main language is one of the languages supported by Participedia and mention this and how they can change the language. The collaborative writing task of the second session can be briefly explained. The main facilitator should make sure their students understand the task and that teachers are able to support them.  A maximum of four weeks should be the gap between the first and second sessions so as not to lose momentum. Teachers can liaise with students during this time to support them to complete the task.Democracy Lab IIThe second session of Democracy Lab is dedicated to a collaborative writing task, where students systematise their notes, organise their thoughts and do some group writing to summarise their reflections and findings on the questions they have considered. Again, there is no set time but note that the group writing task is pretty challenging for anyone, so sufficient time needs to be dedicated to this part.  The first task is to return to the sticky notes from the first session, question by question. Students are asked to group the notes together into themes, and to identify common themes that emerge. For example, common values of democracy such as equality and freedom. This should be repeated for each question and can generally be done quite quickly. The purpose of this simple task is to demonstrate how to start organising existing notes when preparing an academic assignment, and how this helps to organise our thoughts and build a structure for our writing.  The second task is collaborative writing in small groups. Students should form four groups and each group is assigned a question. For practical reasons, there should be no more than 5-6 people in each group. Their task is to summarise the notes from their question into a short paragraph of a couple of sentences. One person can nominate themselves to actually write, but the expectation is that everybody contributes. This task is a matter of reviewing the notes, now organised, and trying to turn them from notes into sentences. This also requires synthesising different points and sources together.  The facilitator should explain that this is a difficult task, and that the amount written at the end is not important. Students might have to consider how to handle opposing opinions within their group, or very disparate responses, and how to represent the views of each other. If time is limited, or the task feels too difficult, this can be skipped and you can instead, ask the group to continue organising the sticky notes to make a essay plan, arranging the themes already identified into a logical order that could become a written assignment - instead of doing the actual writing.  Time allowing, the third task is for students to add their final reflections and feedback on the session in a separate frame.Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsFollowing the second session, the lead facilitator can put together the students writing to create a short written article. If there is more time available, this can be done as a group during the session. This task is a matter of creating a structure that flows and makes sense to an external reader. Adding links to cases and other sources is encouraged, as well as other transitions and necessary points. This article could serve a number of purposes (that should be discussed during the session):presented to the rest of the school  posted on the school website or magazine  submitted to a local newspaper  submitted as a group assessment  posted online as a blogThe general idea is that student have a collaboratively written piece that demonstrates the skills and learning they have hopefully gained during the session.  It's important to recognise that in future applications, the purpose of this final article should be discussed with the students, who might have their own ideas and aspirations for what they want to achieve. For example, different contexts might face different threats to democracy that students wish to focus on. In this case, the lesson plan should be open enough to allow for these contextual directions and students should be supported to orient their writing towards a collective goal, collaboratively defined.  Because Democracy Lab has only been run once, and was not formally evaluated, there is no evidence on its impact and effects. Informally, feedback from teachers afterwards suggested that students were highly engaged in the topic, even if they seemed quiet during the session.Analysis and Lessons LearnedAs mentioned above, there has been no formal evaluation of Democracy Lab. The points below are based on Lucy's experience of designing and delivering the sessions.After the first session, students fed back that they felt a bit isolated each on their own computers in the classroom (students were physically in class but the session was online). As a result, the second session was designed to include in-person group work. The session could be easily adapted to either all online (using breakout rooms) or all in-person (using actual sticky notes and whiteboards instead of Miro). The first session could also be adapted to include pair rather than individual work.  The sessions were conducted in English, with students who were all studying and being taught in English in their civic education class. This could of course be adapted for different language needs, but is limited by the languages supported on Participedia (currently seven).  The depth and breadth of the sessions was pretty ambitious; taking students from democratic theory to democratic innovations to collaborative writing in less than three hours total. Teaching online also makes it more difficult to gauge understanding and engagement and at points Lucy wasn't sure if everybody was following. Having regular check ins throughout helped with this, and creating an open and informal atmosphere welcoming questions, and also emphasising that the session involved some difficult work that is usually university level.  Having simple check in and check out activities helped to break the ice and create a sense of being together. These were done both in the chat, on the camera and speaking out loud and involved sharing a feeling or doing a physical movement.As mentioned above, the format and specific questions for Democracy Lab can and should be adapted for local contexts and considerations. Given additional time and resources, the facilitator, teachers and students could design the questions and process together in advance of the sessions. The only core themes are: the connection between democratic theory (the core questions) and practice (democratic innovations on Participedia) and the idea of working together to create a final output.See AlsoReferencesExternal LinksNotes",1,0,0,0,0,"(6492,collection,""Participedia Team"")"

With the freely usable participation platform adhocracy+, municipalities, organisations, institutions or companies can digitally involve people in decision-making processes. Digital citizen participation at the municipal level makes it possible to bring transparency to political decision-making processes, promotes stronger identification of citizens with their municipality and strengthens trust in democracy and politics. For the municipal administration, it also facilitates the documentation and evaluation of citizen participation processes. The online participation tool is already used by over 280 organisations.  Usage  The use of adhocracy+ is free of charge and possible without technical knowledge. The non-profit association  Liquid Democracy e. V.  finances the further development and operation from donations and optional additional services. The entire code of adhocracy+ is public and can be viewed, used and edited.  HistoryThe first version of the open source software adhocracy was developed by Friedrich Lindenberg and Martin Storbeck from 2009 to 2011 for the online participation of organisations and institutions. Since 2009, the non-profit association Liquid Democracy e.V. has continued to develop theadhocracy softwareand has already released several versions of the software since then. In November 2019, adhocracy+ was launched as a self-hosted participation platform.How it WorksCreating your own participation process via adhocracy+ is simple. It requires neither prior technical knowledge nor programming skills and is therefore easy to implement for everyone. The platform is available to organisations as a software-as-a-service (SaaS). After an email request, organisations receive their own area on adhocracy+ and a URL according to the model https://adhocracy.plus/yourorganisation. Alternatively, they can also receive an additional service: a web page with a URL. Alternatively, they can select a different URL as an additional service.Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  The free online participation tool adhocracy+ enables all municipalities, regardless of their financial situation, to integrate citizens into decision-making. In this way, the participating municipalities strengthen people's trust in local administration, politics and democracy. The platform is also to be designed to be as barrier-free as possible in order to enable all people to participate.

Small-scale fisheries are often poorly measured at a global level and have been ignored by states’ policy-making in the past, despite their enormous “aggregate global contribution to nutrition, food security and poverty eradication” [3]. Small-scale fishing governance from the 1990s to the present day focuses on integrated approaches like interactive governance, ecosystem-based management, or territorial user rights [3].Women are universally crucial in each link of the value chain in small-scale fisheries, but their most well-known role comes in the processing and marketing of fish and other products in fishery [1]. The perception of a gendered division of labour in fishing has thus shaped the approach developmental initiatives will take when supporting small-scale fisheries [1]. Research regarding women’s contributions in fisheries aims to examine how women can access productive tools and resources, as these findings can be introduced to forms of existing resource management arrangements like co-management and community-based management; these strategies may additionally improve the participation of women in decision-making and fishery resource management [1]. The purpose of this research is thus to examine informal methods that could increase avenues for the participation of women in fisheries management, especially when these informal methods are overlooked due to not being institutionalized or designated as formal methods that are circulating.Origins and DevelopmentThe research paper titled “Access and institutions in a small-scale octopus fishery: A gendered perspective” (2019) by conducted a study entailing the systematic analysis of the institutions structuring access to resources at a level of individual fishing activity, specifically within women’s fisheries [2]. This study was conducted in the northernmost province of Mozambique, called Cado Delgado, specifically within the Quirimbas National Park (QNP).  A second study, conducted by Norad (2014) titled “How to reduce gender discrimination in the fisheries and aquaculture sectors” identifies existing institutional mechanisms like markets as key sources of insufficient opportunities for women; this places women at an economic disadvantage and makes them unable to change that situation [5]. One of these primary interventions that Norad (2014) offer is to organize women fish traders [5]. Because women fish traders are not organized, collective bargaining power at fish landing sites is weakened [5]. Thus, a proposed intervention is in increasing the participation of women in Community Fishing Councils (CCPs) [5].Participant Recruitment and SelectionWosu’s (2019) study focuses on the study site on Ibo Island [2]. Norad’s (2014) study was conducted as a fact-finding mission aiming to identify entry points for improving the economic situation and work conditions of women in the fishery value chains in the Gaza Province [5].How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-MakingWosu’s (2019) study first defines the conceptual framework by defining institutions in the context of fisheries management, expanding the formally rule-based system to one influenced by values, beliefs and knowledge that may or may not operate formally [2]. Her method is defined through the following framework [2]:This case uses multiple methods, the first being fisher-follows, in which participants were observed during the women's fishing trips. These occurred with fishermen identified as having “good local knowledge of octopus fishing and with whom a trusting relationship had been established” [2]. The second method was key informant interviews, which occurred with local traders who described the processes involved in trading, imams and village chiefs who explained the customs of resource division, and octopus fisherwomen [2]. The final method was informal discussions, which were conducted to understand economic exchanges and social relationships, alongside the power relations characterizing them [2]. Informal discussions occurred with octopus fisherwomen and local fishermen, alongside boat owners and traders [2]. Norad’s (2014) study had the following breaks down their fact-finding mission into institutional and field information collection phases. This involved meeting actors within aquaculture value chains – ""men and/or women from fishers, traders, fish farmers, CCPs and PCR groups"" [5].The process of fisher-follows in Wosu's (2019) occurred by identifying the women that were identified as fishers with local knowledge of octopus fishing where a trusting relationship was established [2]. Key informant interviews were conducted at the end of fieldwork periods, once informal observations uncovered particular issues [2].Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsThe results discovered that, in terms of access to octopus fishing sites, the study discovered that while the regulations of the National Park restricted women's access to fishing sites, informal discussions with fisherwomen revealed that religious norms posed additional restrictions to women in travelling to a populous fishing area [2]. Though religious norms related to gender segregation made men reluctant to allow women on their boats, some fisherwomen were able to overcome these barriers by leveraging familial relationships [2]. Access to fishing was also found to be regulated in individual households; informal discussions with fisherwomen through fisher-follows discovered that engaging in octopus fishing sometimes required seeking permission from the head of household, usually their husband, before leaving the household for long periods [2]. Married fisherwomen thus navigated this through social networks to form fishing groups, which are made up of family members or friends [2]. Working as a group is a strategic tactic that can help in dangerous events like injuries while fishing or obtaining permission to live at home [2]. Frequent fisherwomen were found to have large networks and fish in groups of six to eight [2].Norad’s (2014) study notes the development of a 'mentoring' role between new and experienced fish farmers, as this helps combat the “current institutional mechanisms, including markets, provide few opportunities for women, putting women at an economic disadvantage and unable to change their situation” [5]. Because fish farmers already act as National Institute for Aquaculture Development (INAQUA) ""demonstrators"", their experience would support newcomers with more information and technical knowledge regarding pond management [5].Analysis and Lessons Learned  See Also  References[1]https://www.fao.org/3/i4884e/i4884e.pdf  [2]  https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0308597X19301150?token=88A3F7FF464A1B1D94937BB0A04CC6F498E88977ABB84E848B2FD77DD05F88D84132B878065D838FADE64CED2128C978&amp;originRegion=us-east-1&amp;originCreation=20230131054149  [3]https://nicholasinstitute.duke.edu/sites/default/files/publications/strengthening-governance-of-small-scale-fisheries.pdf  [4]http://pubs.iclarm.net/resource_centre/Big_Numbers_Project_Preliminary_Report.pdf  [5] Study of fisheries and aquaculture value chains in Mozambique: How to reduce gender discrimination in the fisheries and aquaculture sectorshttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/303284145_Study_of_fisheries_and_aquaculture_value_chains_in_Mozambique_How_to_reduce_gender_discrimination_in_the_fisheries_and_aquaculture_sectors?enrichId=rgreq-3cb8455f37599d1cc393747786533446-XXX&amp;enrichSource=Y292ZXJQYWdlOzMwMzI4NDE0NTtBUzozNjI2ODcxNjgwNDA5NjBAMTQ2MzQ4Mjc2NzMxMA%3D%3D&amp;el=1_x_3&amp;_esc=publicationCoverPdf  External Links  Notes ",1,0,0,0,0,"(8164,collection,""Women Fisherfolk and Democratic Participation"")"

Efforts to secure affordable housing—and, by extension, reduce economic inequalities associated with homeownership—are especially relevant in the context of the global housing crisis. This crisis has its roots in the shift towards neoliberal housing policies in the 1980s,[2] and was exacerbated by the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic.[1] Beginning in the 1980s, governments slowly gutted public housing subsidies in favour of support for private ownership, development, and investment. By the 2000s, corporate finance had come to dominate investment and lending in the housing sector. Quantitative easing and austerity measures following the global financial crisis further encouraged speculation and exacerbated inequalities. These developments widened the gap between the rich and poor and sowed the seeds of the current crisis. In most countries today, growth in housing costs and rent continues to outstrip income growth; the result is that more and more families live in financial precarity, and homelessness is on the rise.[1] Increasing access to affordable housing is essential in this context.CLTs are designed to respond to the failures of market-led solutions to housing-related issues. The model is a form of social housing, which aims to insulate against market volatility, foster social equality, and encourage resident control.[3] CLTs use ground leases to ensure permanent housing affordability and prevent owners from profiting off of land value inflation.[4] The model can be used to address crises of affordability in both “hot” and “cold” markets. In “hot” markets, prices are high and gentrification is pervasive, meaning that property values rise as a result of development in traditionally affordable areas, which tends to displace lower-income residents.[4] In “cold” markets, where prices are low, housing becomes unaffordable as incomes fall, and disinvestment and decline create problems.[5][6] CLTs aim to promote affordability and protect vulnerable residents regardless of market cycles.Social infrastructure and agricultureCLT-owned land can be used for a variety of purposes apart from housing. Non-residential structures developed on CLT-owned land have included premises for neighborhood businesses, nonprofits, and social service providers, as well as community centres, daycares, and parks.[7][4] CLTs are particularly useful for promoting land uses that are valuable to the community but devalued in the market, including so-called “third places”: the “informal, celebratory spaces in which neighboring occurs and community happens.""[4] Insulating these spaces against market forces is essential for preserving shared heritage and strengthening community bonds. Finally, the model has applications in agriculture: CLTs are used in rural settings to support farming, forestry, and conservation, and in cities to support community gardens, commercial greenhouses, and urban farms.[4] The CLT is intended to be flexible, enabling support for a range of land uses depending on community needs.Community controlCLTs are designed not only to promote socially valuable and sustainable land uses, but also to facilitate community control over the decision-making processes that determine those uses and guide development. This feature responds to the lack of community voice that contributes to resident disempowerment in other tenure models. With inclusive governance by a board that balances elected representation of residents, other community members, and the public interest more broadly,[7] the CLT is a model of community-led development and democratic accountability.Racial justiceAlong with economic inequalities, CLTs promise to help address the racial gaps in homeownership, wealth, and debt that are common in places with legacies of discrimination and dispossession. In the U.S., for example, slavery, segregation, redlining, environmental racism, and discriminatory lending practices have systematically drained wealth from Black communities.[8][9] The effects persist today: Black households own significantly less wealth and significantly more debt than white households.[8] Black people and members of other racial minorities are also less likely to achieve homeownership, and are less able to use homeownership as a means of creating wealth because they are at a disadvantage in the loan and credit markets.[10] Similar patterns of historical discrimination and entrenched inequality are prevalent in other countries. The CLT model can help mitigate the effects by making homeownership more accessible and secure for disadvantaged racial groups and by providing an opportunity to build wealth across generations.CLTs in the global southCLTs in the global south operate in unique circumstances, although these differ substantially by country and region. In the global south, the creation of informal settlements is a prominent response to housing unaffordability.[11] Close to one billion people worldwide live in these “self-produced communities, classified as informal due to their lack of compliance to codes, laws, and regulations,” where poverty is often rampant and infrastructure is often lacking.[11] Several policy interventions, including mass social housing, upgrading, and land titling, have attempted to address informality, with mixed effects.[11] CLTs are being pioneered as an alternative policy response for promoting housing affordability, combating poverty, and promoting equitable and sustainable development in the context of informality in the global south.Origins and DevelopmentThe community land trust in its modern form was developed by a group of sharecroppers and civil rights activists in the U.S. in the late 1960s. However, the model’s theoretical and ethical underpinnings are far from new, and its creators were inspired by experiments in communal land ownership from around the world.Land as a sacred trustCLT activists point out that the idea of land as a private commodity is relatively new, whereas the idea of land as a sacred, common inheritance is ancient and widespread, appearing for instance in the Vedic tradition, early Christianity, and Indigenous North American teachings.[12] This latter understanding of land was articulated in the 19th century by the American political economist Henry George. George argued that landlords profit from, yet contribute nothing to, increases in land value created by the productivity of others.[13] His proposed solution to this injustice was a “single tax” that would tax away the appreciation in value and use it for the public benefit.[13] Ralph Borsodi, a CLT pioneer, built on this idea to argue that land should be “trustery,” not property.[13] The land trust and its role in preventing profiteering from land value inflation is at the heart of the CLT model.George deeply influenced Ebenezer Howard, the British urban planner who developed the model of the Garden City: a centrally planned, autonomous community built on land leased out to individuals by a municipal corporation acting on behalf of all residents.[13] George’s ideas also inspired the creation of experimental “single-tax colonies” in the United States, which combined community ownership of the land with individual ownership of its improvements.[13] In these early leased-land models, there are clear echoes of the modern CLT.TheGramdanmovement and agricultural cooperatives in IsraelMahatma Ghandi articulated a concept of “trusteeship” in which land and other assets were to be held in trust for the poor, and envisioned a society made up of autonomous villages.[4] Gandhi’s legacy was inherited by Vinoba Bhave, who started theBoodanor “Land Gift” movement, compelling rich landowners to give away some of their land to the rural poor. Because individual peasants easily lost their land to moneylenders and speculators, in 1952 the movement became theGramdanor “Village Gift” movement: land was donated to entire villages, to be held in trust by the village council and leased to local farmers. Over 160,000Gramdanvillages were established, taking the leased-land model to a scale unprecedented in North America.In Israel in the early 1900s, the Jewish National Fund bought Palestinian land and leased it out for Jewish settlement through 99-year ground leases.[12] The result was planned agricultural communities calledkibbutzimandmoshavim  . Themoshavim  , in which most production, procurement, and enterprise were cooperative but families held titles to their homes individually, more closely resembled the CLT.New Communities, Inc.The CLT in its modern form was born of the Civil Rights struggle in the American South. The first CLT, called New Communities, Inc. (NCI), was established in Albany, Georgia in 1969 by Charles and Shirley Sherrod, Slater King, and other community organizers for the purpose of combating discrimination in land rights and lending.[9] Its creators had studied Henry George’s thinking and visited India and Israel to learn about the use of collective tenure models there. Bob Swann, who observed that past models were often “enclaves” insulated from the larger society, introduced the concept of open community membership,[5] thus putting the “C” in CLT. Backed by a federal grant, NCI acquired nearly 6,000 acres of farm- and woodland, comprising the largest tract of Black-owned land in the U.S. at the time.[4] The CLT faced hostility from white farmers and business owners and from the segregationist Georgian governor, as well as debt, drought, and discriminatory USDA lending.[4] Because of these setbacks, NCI lost all of their land by 1985.[9]Following the foundation of NCI, CLTs began to spring up in other states, and spread quickly into cities in the 1980s.[6] The model has been adopted in many countries across the global north and the global south—for instance Canada, Kenya, Australia, the U.K., and Puerto Rico[14][11]—always tailored to meet local needs.How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-MakingA community land trust develops when a community-created nonprofit corporation buys parcels of land with support from public or private donors, removing it permanently from the speculative market. The land is never resold, but instead leased out to individual owners, housing cooperatives, nonprofit and for-profit developers, and other entities through long-term ground leases for uses approved by the community.[7] Ground leases, which typically last 99 years, are renewable and inheritable, with built-in affordability and resale controls.[13] The nonprofit corporation acts as a steward to the land, responding to evolving community needs. It has a continued interest in and responsibility for ensuring the appropriate use, structural integrity, and ongoing affordability of any building located on its lands.[7] The enduring relationship between the steward and the community distinguishes the CLT from other models of development.In the “classic” CLT model, the board has a tripartite structure in which a third of members represent residents or leaseholders, a third represent members of the broader community, and a third represent the public interest (i.e., public officials, local funders, nonprofit housing and social service providers, etc.).[7] Importantly, CLTs have a system of “open, place-based membership” in anyone in the area covered by the CLT—which may be as small as a single neighbourhood or as large as a whole city or state—can become a voting member.[7] Thus a key feature distinguishing the CLT from other tenure models is its democratic, inclusive, and community-led governance structure.Collaboration with local governments and with third parties is an essential aspect of CLT operation. CLTs may work with municipal officials, private funders, other nonprofit and community-based organizations, housing cooperatives, and developers.[15] The CLT governance structure ensures that all of these voices are heard, but none dominates. Finally, engaging and educating community members is essential for a CLT’s success. A community-led model requires that community members understand how the model works, support its objectives, and are motivated to participate.[4] CLTs, therefore, depend upon and contribute to the creation of a network of strong public, private, and community-based relationships.Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsThe influence of the community land trust model remains limited. Especially in the global south,[11] CLTs are not yet a part of the mainstream land and housing policy debates. However, scholarly, government, and activist interest in CLTs is growing steadily, and as existing CLTs continue to demonstrate their merit, proponents of the model are hopeful that uptake will increase. More research is required to fully assess the benefits and limitations of the CLT, but empirical studies provide early validation for each of the beneficial outcomes described here.HousingCLTs have proven effective in securing long-term affordable housing and preventing displacement and loss. CLTs make homeownership and its benefits more accessible to households of limited means by decreasing purchase prices and making mortgages more affordable, and resale restrictions keep prices low over time.[4] In effect, ground leasing keeps public and private subsidies in the land and distributes land-based wealth intergenerationally.[4] CLTs can also prevent displacement in the context of gentrification via long-term affordability controls.[4] Moreover, the steward can intervene to force building maintenance and repairs, protect residents against predatory lending and unfair property taxes, and prevent foreclosure in case of defaults.[7][4] Thus in neighbourhoods plagued by disinvestment and decline, CLT stewardship can prevent erosion of equity, deferred maintenance, and home loss.[4] The ability of the steward to advocate for residents’ rights also shields against the effects of financial shocks. This manifests in lower rates of home loss; for example, following the global financial crisis, the residents of resale-restricted homes experienced rates of default and foreclosure ten times lower than residents of market-rate homes.[4] These housing-related benefits have been realized in both the global north and the global south.[11]Community controlAnother important outcome of CLTs is democratic community control over development. The CLT governance structure is community-led, balances public and private interests, and keeps the steward accountable to the community on an ongoing basis. By facilitating participatory planning, the model provides a level of citizen control that goes beyond mere consultation.[4] Community control also allows CLTs to respond more directly to community and resident priorities.[11] Community control, which is missing from other tenure models, is the feature that defines the CLT as a democratic innovation.Mitigating inequalitiesThe CLT has also shown promise as a means of addressing intersecting racial, class-based, and gender inequalities. CLTs serve mostly families making less than area median income, and serve more households of colour and women-headed households compared to other tenure models.[10] Therefore, they can explicitly target land- and housing-related issues facing vulnerable groups, and the benefits of increased affordability, tenure security, and opportunities for wealth creation accrue disproportionately to members of these groups. Finally, the potential to empower people traditionally marginalized from decision-making through CLT governance[11] can help to address disparities in political power along racial, class, and gender lines.Analysis and Lessons LearnedCLTs are constrained by the need to cooperate with public and private partners in the context of a neoliberal policy environment. CLTs rely on local governments for support in land acquisition and development, and therefore must work closely with public officials and adapt to the political climate, in addition to complying with local laws and regulations.[11] Moreover, CLTs must cultivate private development interest[15] and convince private lenders to mortgage homes on leased land,[4] all while balancing these actors’ profit-oriented goals with the goals of the community.Internal organization may pose additional challenges. CLTs generally develop out of existing community organizations and require willingness, commitment, and agreement from community members and residents in order to work.[11] Absent strong leadership and existing infrastructure for advocacy and community engagement, starting and sustaining a CLT may prove challenging.More broadly, debate continues as to whether or not CLTs can achieve the kind of broad socio-economic and political transformations envisioned by their original creators. Some argue that because of the extent to which CLTs must compromise in order to survive within existing political and economic systems, the model has lost its radical edge.[6] Some believe that the CLT has become a technocratic solution used by policy elites to respond to pressures in the housing sector, rather than a form of genuine community mobilization with broad applications. Another challenge moving forward will be to maintain the community-controlled nature of CLTs.[6] As CLTs become increasingly institutionalized and professionalized, they may lose their emphasis on community control. Moreover, many CLTs now serve large geographic areas, which can weaken their relationship to place-based communities. These developments may limit the model’s transformative potential.On the other hand, in many CLTs today grassroots activism for economic, racial, and environmental justice is alive and well.[9] Additionally, the very existence of an alternative to the market model may be considered transformative, reshaping power relations despite operating on a limited scale.[6] CLTs challenge the neoliberal paradigm by restricting the power of private developers and lenders and decommodifying land, which is central to the kind of “commoning” practice that combats accumulation by dispossession and other forms of socio-spatial injustice.[16][15] Moreover, the redistributive effects of CLTs may be considered transformative, especially through intersections with the politics of resistance by oppressed communities.[6] In the words of John Davis, the CLT “is a platform for redistribution, putting property and power into the hands of people historically deprived of both.”[4] CLTs can, therefore, effect socio-economic and political change at a deep level.CLTs are not the ultimate cure for poverty, housing insecurity, or historically-rooted inequalities. However, they can be a powerful tool for mitigating the impacts of these problems on vulnerable people. CLTs provide a compelling alternative to the market system and a means of securing long-term affordable housing and other community assets, addressing inequalities, and enabling community control over the land.See AlsoOakland Community Land TrustDudley Street Neighborhood InitiativeReferences  [1] Masterson, V.

Issues arise particularly to the detriment of nonprofit managers attempting to seek investments and grants from external parties. Government officials, grant providers, and private investors may provide their frameworks for success metrics to which nonprofits must adhere. Yet, the inherent problem stems from the difficulty of measuring social impact outcomes. Success metrics are often unable to quantify the intersectionality of social, political, and economic barriers that make it difficult for nonprofits to provide investors with reports on growth or development of outcomes beyond traditional means. Thus, nonprofits often struggleto sustain programs that are essential to their communities while also attempting to provide traditional metrics to investors and grant providers of social impact.Origins and DevelopmentQuantifying inputs of nonprofit organizations is relatively simple, including financial statements and non-financial metrics such as number of volunteers or equipment [1]. Furthermore, quantifying outputs is also straightforward in the form of the number of people served, including qualitative surveys to measure the quality of programs and the number of people served by the nonprofit program. However, outcomes are the most complex metric that a nonprofit attempts to measure. Measuring outcomes, specifically the community impact of social programs can be difficult, unstandardized, and sometimes impossible to quantify without considering the broader impact of intersectionality. For example, measuring the impact of arts-based community solutions to poverty reduction and unemployment reduction can be challenging to quantify beyond the employment statistics of its participants. There are unmeasurable outcomes of these solutions on mental health and health within quantitative terms, however they can be measured using qualitative data. In fact, private investors at times trust and are more confident in qualitative data than quantitative financial data as measurements of performance [2].One of the primary benefits of data analytics tools is their ability to maximize impact and prove strategic operations. Data and analytics enable organizations to gain insights into financials and budgeting of target markets by clustering governmental data and differentiating the needs of communities. By analyzing data on everything from donor behaviour to program outcomes, non-profit organizations can make more informed decisions to identify new growth opportunities and outreach. Nonetheless, the humanitarian sector is complex due to different levels of data granularity [3].Marketing firms such as Nexus Marketing and Big Leap offer services for mission-driven, community-focused organizations. Integrated within digital media, the software prioritizes search engine optimization, content marketing, and conversion rate optimization. By using data, firms increase traffic and generate leads for prospective clients. From a directorial perspective, these analytical tools improve impact assessment reports. Managers gain a deeper understanding of performance data and attitudes toward using data in their work with staff and stakeholders.Yet, analytical trends within the nonprofit industry expose inaccuracies and delays that compromise the goal-setting and decision-making aspects of the organization [4]. One study states the root of the issue arises from monitoring and evaluating non-profit organizations, extending to technical logistics such as data drift and fragmentation [5]. Data may not be fully accurate, up-to-date, and may have limited funding or resources that can hinder decision-making processes. In addition, one study exposed the underlying issue thatdata must capture the dignity of the human being represented within the data [6].An application of the development of community participatory action research (CPAR) is using thistool for evaluation in community-based participatory evaluation (CPBE). CPAR is a research methodology that originated during the 1960s and 1970s civil rights movement, developing to its use today to conduct qualitative research ethically and equitably. It involves community members in all aspects of the research process from identifying research questions and collecting data, to analyzing and interpreting findings. The goal of CPAR is to empower communities by involving them in research addressing social justice, equity, and community development issues.On the other hand, CPBE is an evaluation methodology that involves community members in the evaluation process. This includes identifying evaluation questions and collecting data, interpreting findings, and making recommendations for program improvement. The goal of CBPE is to empower communities by involving them in the evaluation of programs and services that impact their lives.While both CPAR and CBPE involve community members in research and evaluation, the main difference is in the approach's focus. CPAR focuses on addressing community issues through research and action, while CBPE focuses on evaluating programs and services to improve outcomes for communities. CPBE offers non-profit organizations service-learning partnerships where participants collaborate on collecting, analyzing, and understanding data. The pedagogical approach helps collect data ethically in accordance with social justice.Thus, CBPE can be a useful tool in collecting qualitative data in implementing community programs to provide performance metrics to investors, government grant providers, and external parties. It effectively captures the intersectionality of the barriers faced by communities and the complexity of social impact that traditional metrics cannot achieve. It is a useful tool that goes beyond just providing metrics of success for nonprofit organizations' social impact performance, although can also be applied to improve the quality of their programs at the same time.Participant Recruitment and SelectionThe recruitment process can involve a general call for volunteers, approaching specific individuals committed to the project, or soliciting recommendations from community leaders or stakeholders. It is recommended to use communication channels that reach participants in nonprofit services or programs, making the message clear by using plain language and explaining the benefits of participation. It is important to encourage potential participants while being honest about the work required and providing support such as transportation. It should emphasize the need to put together a team that is a cross-section of the stakeholder population to get a true perspective of the thinking and perceptions of the group.How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-MakingThe process typically begins with a planning phase in which evaluators and stakeholders identify the purpose and scope of the evaluation, the questions to be answered, the data collection methods to be used, and the roles as well as responsibilities of the participants. Data is then collected through the selected medium surveys, interviews, and focus groups, as stakeholders are actively involved in the data collection process.The next phase involves analyzing the data and making sense of the results. The evaluators and stakeholders interpret the data, identify trends and patterns, and draw conclusions about the program or project. In this phase, stakeholders also have the opportunity to provide their insights and perspectives on the data.Finally, the evaluators and stakeholders work together to make decisions based on the evaluation results. This may involve identifying areas for improvement, developing action plans, and making changes to the program or project. Throughout the process, stakeholders are actively involved in the decision-making process and have a voice in shaping the future direction of the program or project.Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsCBPE can significantly influence the project or program being evaluated, as well as on the evaluation participants. The evaluation can result in a more comprehensive understanding of the project or program's impact by involving a diverse group of stakeholders, including those who may not have been traditionally included in the decision-making process. Furthermore, the process of CBPE can empower participants to take ownership of the evaluation process and feel a greater sense of investment in the project or program.The outcomes of CBPE can vary depending on the goals of the evaluation and the specific project or program being evaluated. However, some common outcomes include increased community engagement, improved project or program design, and a more comprehensive understanding of the project or program's social impact. By involving a diverse group of stakeholders, CPBE can also result in greater buy-in and support for the project or program.CBPE can have both short-term and long-term effects on the project or program being evaluated and on the evaluation participants. In the short term, CPBE can lead to changes in project or program design, increased community engagement, and a more comprehensive understanding of the project or program's impact. In the long term, it can result in sustained community engagement, support for the project or program, and increased capacity for community members to engage in evaluation and decision-making processes. CPBE can also foster relationships between community members and project or program staff, leading to greater collaboration and trust in the long term.Analysis and Lessons LearnedResults from CPBE include the importance of involving stakeholders in the evaluation process from the outset, creating a shared understanding of the intervention being evaluated, and developing a feasible and relevant evaluation plan to the stakeholders. It provides comprehensive feedback at multiple steps of the nonprofit’s impact on community members, depending on its implementation.CPBE can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of interventions, as well as the needs and perspectives of stakeholders. It can facilitate capacity building and empowerment among stakeholders as they become more involved in the evaluation process while gaining a deeper understanding of the evaluated intervention.The CPBE process can be applied beyond the scope of just qualitative research and be used in nonprofit performance assessment to be shown to external parties. It begins to tackle the issue of being unable to capture the intersectionality and complexities of social impact by providing qualitative data in a structured manner. With the right approach and careful dedication of resources, it can be a useful tool for organizations that are challenged with assessing the impact of their social programs to provide for third parties.See Also  References  [1]  Larkin, R., Dunning, C., Suarez, C., Smukowski, A., Hiscox, H., Dang, C., &amp; Sak, L.

Our democracy faces a significant risk of crisis due to a lack of trust in politicians, governments, and institutions and an increasingly polarised community.  The combination of these phenomenon is making substantial reform by governments very difficult and creating substantial risks to our system of democracy.  Giving citizens a way into the political process through large scale collective engagement methods offered by deliberative democracy offers a way forward. However, to date those with the fundamental task of giving citizens a way into democratic politics have to various extents failed to use these methods effectively.[1]There are several issues underpinning this failure including, a lack of understanding/ knowledge of engagement practice, philosophical perspectives on representative democracy and bureaucratic structural constraints.  We know that both Australians and politicians want to address the problems of polarisation and distrust, however they have very different perspectives on ‘how’ to do it.  At the centre of our democracy, are our MP’s – those people elected by the community to represent them in parliament – in creating the legislation and laws which governs our lives.  This process is a way to nurture and take care of that critical connection between an MP and their community. By deepening the way in which local people can participate in democratic life, we will have better understanding, better trust and ultimately better outcomes.  For community, the process will build cohesion, as it will enable the community to find agreement on issues which are polarising. It will also enable the community to share the diversity of its views – supporting the MP to hear from people beyond those who have strong views or are active with the political office.  For MP’s this process will help them better do their job – both for the community and in the parliament, enabling them to be confident they understand the breadth and depth of where the community lies on an issue. This provides an opportunity to demonstrate mutual trust and secure a stronger mandate for action, when required.  One other benefit of this process is that it will raise awareness and understanding across the community of the role of MPs and also improve understanding of how the parliamentary system works.  Origins and Development  Local Members want to represent the needs and interests of their communities.  On the face of it, this sounds simple enough, however it is of course challenging in any community because the views are not homogenous. It is also getting harder because our communities are also becoming increasingly polarised – with views moving to the right and the left of the centre.  Local members also most commonly only hear from loud voices when people are upset, it can be challenging to hear from the full diversity of the electorate.  Given this, (and due to simple logistical issues of representing such a significant group of people), it can be hard for local members to easily determine where the weight of the views of their community are or better yet, where their community might be able to find ‘agreement’ / common ground on a way forward. As it stands, local members hear different views from their communities and are left to either choose sides, guess at a possible middle ground, or not act at all. Local members use their best judgement, given their personal knowledge of their community, to decide what is best. Sometimes this is enough, but often members feel that they would like to have a deeper level of understanding &amp; insight.  There are also challenges associated with disparate levels of information / knowledge and understanding of the ‘facts’ or ‘truth’.It is not uncommon for local members to be party to information (research, scientific analysis, etc) that most people don’t have access to and hence they develop a different level of understanding than most of the community they represent.  Further amplifying these problems, is that we know Australians don’t have high levels of trust in their parliamentarians– those very people who they elect every few to represent them!  In a recent study undertaken by the Museum of Australian Democracy (MOAD) and the Institute for Governance and Policy Analysis (IGPA), nearly 1500 Australians were surveyed to understand their trust in the political system and in our democracy.  [1]Key findings include:Satisfaction with our democracy is at its lowest level since 1996  The trust we have in government and politicians is the lowest since 1993  Baby boomers no longer trust their politicians  People don’t care who represents them  We don’t trust Federal, State or Local Governments – however of these three we trust local government more than the restThese findings are reinforced by the 2019 Australian Electoral Study, which foundTrust in government has reached its lowest level on record in 2019, with data covering a 50-year period since 1969.  Trust in government has declined by nearly 20% since 2007.  56% of Australians believe that the government is run for ‘a few big interests’, while just 12% believe the government is run for ‘all the people.  [2]It is this combination of factors – a keenness from local members to reach a deeper level of connection and understanding of their communities and the need to improve trust and respect in the institutions of government that have spurred us to develop the concept we outline here.What do politicians want vs what Australians want?A survey by the Museum of Australian Democracy of 98 Federal members of Parliament found thatFederal MPs are sufficiently concerned about the trust divide between citizens and politicians to favour substantial actions to improve confidence in our institutions  [3]  .  On balance Federal MP’s want to adjust and strengthen the way that representative democracy works; to make parties better at performing their three roles in providing community linkages, effective governance, and democratic integrity.  Our Federal political appear to have limited desire to open up the system to direct influence from the public. At the same time parliamentarians embrace other reforms that enhance the community-linkage role including: less voting on party lines based on manifesto promises and more free votes (46%)Only 13.5% of Federal MPs thought citizens juries based on the criminal jury system and comprised of a random sample of up to 15 Australian citizens should be used to solve complex policy problems that the Australian Parliament can’t fix.  The report concludes by stating that,“Historically, reform choices have been presented as a binary choice between reforms that strengthen the representative system of government and reforms that extend greater public participation. It is increasingly evident, however, that both Australian citizens and politicians think that participatory reforms can be used to bolster the legitimacy of representative democracy and enhance trust between government and citizen.”“We need to get more involved but they [government and politicians] don’t have time for us and our views. Apart from election time. Then they’re interested in us. Maybe that’s what needs to change. They need to be as interested in our views when they’ve been elected.”~ First Time Voter  [4]How does the field of deliberative democracy help?Deliberative democratic processes involve - a diverse group of people having time to consider evidence (information, facts, perspectives) on an issue and come to a decision about what to do (judgement) … and there is a commitment by the commissioning agent to respond.Because of these features, deliberative democratic processes are particularly effective in:Addressing polarisation  – by bringing together people with diverse values/experiences in a positive, constructive environment and supporting them with information (research / facts / evidence). Deliberative processes help people to find a place they can agree (a middle ground). This in turn provides greater legitimacy to make hard choices. These processes help policy makers to better understand policy priorities, the values and reasons behind them, to identify where consensus is and is not feasible, and to overcome political deadlock.  [1]Building trust  – In relationships, a good way to start building trust is to demonstrate trust.  [2]  So it can be expected that trust will be built where governments or leaders show faith and trust in their communities. Trust is also built where governments are willing to be open with information and communicate effectively and honestly. Involving communities in policy making is also cited as a solution to distrust. Central to deliberative engagement practice is government’s demonstrating trust in communities, government being open with information (improved transparency) and honest communication on important policy issues, so it can be expected that deliberative practice is one useful tool for addressing trust issues.  [3]Unfortunately, there is limited specific research into whether deliberative processes build trust between governments and communities, however democracyCo have asked our own participants about their trust in the government when they come into the process and then about their levels of trust at the end and we note substantial improvements.  In addition, citizens are more likely to trust the decisions of people in their community or network over the decisions of politicians. So, trust can be built around the solutions on that issue being deliberated on by the deliberative forum.  [4]This will assist in building a social licence for reform on the issue being deliberated on.Addresses knowledge asymmetry  – by virtue of their position, members of parliament have access to more information than the public – and it is their job to make sure that they are across this information. On the other hand, the public are typically time poor and in part because of this most often aren’t across the current research, data or facts on any given issue. Deliberative democratic practices equalise this knowledge asymmetry substantially – providing the public with access to the different perspectives, facts, research, and data in a way which is well organised and easily accessible, as well as quarantining time to adequately consider the issues.A notable outcome of deliberative processes is that the outcomes or recommendations from the community involved in these processes are almost always strategic – taking a long-term view of the issue and the appropriate long-term solutions. In this way deliberative processes can help address the forces driving ‘short termism’ within governments.Participant Recruitment and Selection  Recruitment for this method uses sortition, and the database used is the Australian trials is the Australian Electoral Role. Given voting is mandatory in Australia, the electoral role is arguably the most diverse and substantial database of Australians.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  DemocracyCo are currently trialling a number of different approaches to The People’s House – in response to the needs of MP’s who are participating. These options explore what the process looks like when the Community set the agenda vs when the MP sets the agenda – both of which are possible under this model.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  The People’s House will have a series of benefits and opportunities to local members:Better enable MPs to hear from the diversity of their electorate – and proactively understand what people are thinking – rather than just hearing after the fact (complaining)  Build community cohesion – address polarisation on key issues in the community, improving community resilience  Confidence that when they go to Parliament the MP understands the breadth of where the community lies on an issueDemonstrate to the community that they are valued and that they are being open with them about the challenges and opportunities  Provides an opportunity to demonstrate mutual trust – and secure a stronger mandate for action – where desired  Opportunity to hear from voices they might not otherwise hear from proactively– open events hear from the same types of people (old / retired (because they have time) or grumpy/ frustrated (because they are disgruntled)  Legacy – improving Australia’s democratic systems and leading innovation in what it means to be a ‘representative’ in a modern democracy  Leadership – establishes them as a leader amongst their peers –setting a new path for MP’s to follows.  Is a mechanism to assist MPs from the major parties to respond to similar mechanisms being used by emerging independents through the “Voices of …” movement)Ultimately, the process is designed to be an additional tool in the tool kit to help MPs represent their community.Analysis and Lessons Learned  DemocracyCo are currently trialling and prototyping the method with two Australian Federal MP's - one from each of the major parties. Significant data is being captured, and evaluations are being undertaken by both community organisations and also some of Australia's major Universities.  One of the key lessons currently being documented, is how best to undertake citizen-led agenda setting. DemocracyCo will be releasing more about this soon.

The human rights lens was originated to apply tocrowdsourcing editorial policies and provide a guide to navigate and identify cases and entries that demonstrate exclusionary impulses. Participedia’s platform is an example of how to make distinctions and explain what is and is not censorship with a framework that celebrates advances of democracy and acknowledges and informs context based challenges that do not progress democracy. The human rights lens framework intends to contribute to enhancing participatory inclusion using language and sources that improve upon a universal human rights framework and refrains from removing and restricting crowdsourcing.The problem the human rights lens aims to address are case entries that lean towards exclusionary impulses with intentional harmful language. While a digital platform is unable to assess intent in case entities from crowdsourcing, the human rights framework considers the circumstances and cultural conflict that provide context. This is addressed through editorial policies that can adhere to a human rights framework and assess apparent exclusionary cases.The objective of the human rights lens is to provide a tangible reference for how to adhere to a human rights framework when producing crowdsource based content on democratic innovations. Its intent is not to assume the intent of the author but provide assisted language and sources that can distinguish between cases that are promoting democratic practices and those that hinder innovation through exclusionary impulses.Origins and DevelopmentThe human rights lens was developed by the Human &amp; Political Rights Cluster of Participedia, one of the six research clusters.[1] The Human &amp; Political Rights Cluster addresses how rights are not secure and equal in many developing countries, and even developed institutions have infrastructures that don’t support marginalized groups sufficiently. The research cluster provides an analysis and supporting language on innovations that support democracy and democratization. The cluster introduced a human rights lens to inform its own platform on Participedia to address cases that involve bias and identify cases that should be revised for harmful language that excludes a group or individual.Although the research cluster initially intended the human rights lens to be applied to its own editorial policy, the human rights lens addressed crowdsourcing information policy that can be applied abroad. Its scope is not limited to its own research expertise but can be expanded to other research clusters and democratic crowdsourcing to promote inclusionary language. The human rights lens has developed from a tool to control visibility of exclusionary cases, to a reference tool that refrains from restricted visibility and focuses on revisionary efforts.Participant Recruitment and SelectionThe human rights lens adheres to advancing knowledge mobilization and stories of democratic innovation globally. It does this through crowdsourcing that has been vital in providing cases that are contributed and reviewed with transparency and integrity. The integrity of cases is what distinguishes how cases are selected to be reviewed by a human rights lens. “Although committed to democratic ideals, Participedia does not advance any ideological, programmatic, institutional, or government agenda. We believe that there are many ways to advance democracy, and that they will differ by place, history, culture, and context-based challenges.” [2] Using the example of Participedia’s mission statement, the human rights lens aims to acknowledge that not all crowdsourcing can advance democracy, however a focus on intentional language can determine the integrity of a case and attempt to remove bias.The language the method derives from are from two examples, one based on the topic of Truth and Reconciliation Commissions (TRCs) and the other on global platforms. The collection on TRCs is an example of how cultural values are crucial in providing context to the intent of democratic practices. [3] One of the questions raised when analyzing TRC’s was, how should language and rhetoric that Participedia utilizes in its Truth and Reconciliation Commission collection inform a wider human rights approach? The human rights lens then developed that even TRCs democratic spaces can restrict individual voices to advance a collective agenda.[4] This introduces the distinction between state building compared to the protection of victims. One of the distinctions the human rights lens reviews is whether a case is emphasizing cultural values of an institution or an individual building their own state and whether that can become overly-bureaucratic.[5] Similarly, the topic of global platforms also discusses the responsibility a human rights lens has to address accountability. When democratic practices are inherently exclusionary, who is accountable for revising its intent? Platform governance is the framework that highlights how editorial policies shape human rights frameworks. [6] By creating a distinction between what is and is not censorship, the human rights lens defines the difference between freedom of expression and intention to harm another group, which is the distinction of exclusionary impulses.How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-MakingBefore revising a case that is flagged as exclusionary, it is important to acknowledge that not all organizations, methods, and cases are intent on promoting progressive views, but are providing historical and cultural context to reasons why systems have not been democratic. The preliminary process weighed the contributions of universal human rights frameworks and values compared to particularistic frameworks. Particularistic frameworks lead that “a political theory that each political group has a right to promote its own interests and especially independence without regard to the interests of larger groups.” [7] Considering this, the human rights lens tends to lean towards a universal human rights framework that references civic inclusion that does consider the effects on smaller or larger groups. Examples of universal human rights frameworks are frameworks and rights outlined by the United Nations that provide a normative approach to global issues and outline resolutions and recommendations to democratic norms and acknowledge that not all citizen-led efforts are democratic. [8]Adhering to an editorial policy are the decision making efforts when deciding whether to revise a case for exclusionary impulses. If it is determined that a publication has misinformed an audience through bias, exclusionary language, and harmful intent, then the human rights lens considers “things like newsworthiness, the context and nature of the posted information, the likelihood and severity of actual or potential harms, and applicable laws” [9] Once it is determined that a case is not advancing democratic practices or informing on non-democratic practices based on context, the human rights lens then apples a universal human rights framework to apply sources and language that acknowledge groups and individuals who are harmed by its context.Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsThe human rights lens intends to contribute to editorial policies for crowdsourcing that expect the following outcomes:To enhance participatory inclusion based on a universal human rights framework.To distinguish between freedom of speech and harmful intentTo ensure that entries are inclusionary, and are only exclusionary with adequate contextAlthough Participedia is the exemplary platform in which the human rights lens is tangible and actively used, other platforms' editorial policies have also encountered issues with crowdsourcingwhere information should be verifiable and cited to ensure integrity. “Medium” is an example of a crowdsourcing platform thatclearly outlines the parameters of its editorial policy and encourages debate amongst its contributors.. However, these debates onthe platform have also recognized threats of violence and incitement; hateful content; harassment; privacy and reputational violations; and copyright and trademark infringement. [10] Considering that exclusionary impulses are not an outcome of one singular platform's editorial policy, but is a common result from rapid crowdsourcing, the human rights lens does not restrict crowdsourcing but rather restrict content that deliberately encourages hateful content.Analysis and Lessons LearnedThe significance of the human rights lens is that it reviews the integrity of crowdsourcing while ensuring crowdsourcing is still accessible. Accessibility is the progressive mechanism that allows democratic practices to be shared rapidly with contrasting views and resources. It is important to facilitate exclusionary cases, but it is also important to refrain from deconstructing digital spaces that promote civil practices and debate.The human rights lens is both a preemptive and preventive method. Inclusionary language and sources on universal human rights frameworks can be used a s guide when outlining democratic innovation cases, but is also preventive in reviewing exclusionary cases that are flagged as not advancing democracy by asking the following questions:How many times has it been reviewed and by whom?Are there design elements that confirm that it has been reviewed by a second reader?Is the language exclusionary of a group or individual, if yes, does it provide context?Does the case adhere to a particularistic or universal framework?References[1]https://participedia.net/about[2] Ibid[3]https://participedia.net/collection/8015[4] Wallace, Jennifer and Bonny Ibhawoh, “Truth Commissions, Civic Participation and State Building,” in Bonny Ibhawoh, Sylvia Bawa and Jasper Ayelazuno eds.

Over 3-4 hours, participants traverse their virtual community, united by a mutual aim - the development of their community guided by set indicators within the game scenario.  The journey initiates with introductions, swiftly transitioning into a captivating simulation punctuated by a brief intermission. Each player embodies a distinct role, collectively navigating towards victory, a feat achievable solely through communal effort and cooperation.  Throughout the game, the Master Facilitator maintains an observant role, providing assistance where necessary, and ensuring the game's objectives are met.  The participants face the exciting challenge of making individual and collective decisions amidst limited resources, promptly processing new information and overcoming crises that emerge during gameplay.  At the game's conclusion, debriefing is conducted, creating a platform for exchanging insights, analysing player strategies, and discussing the game's overall design.  Consistent engagement with the World of Communities game refines entrepreneurial skills, solidifies trust, enhances negotiation capabilities, and promotes resilience. It encourages openness to diverse perspectives, the constructive handling of failure, a willingness to bear responsibility in challenging situations, and cultivates attentiveness, compliance with instructions, and active listening and expression of one's point of view  Origins and Development  Mykhailo Voitovych and Taras Tymchuk designed and developed the tool in Ukraine in 2016. World of Communities started with the belief that in today's complex world, everyone can improve the lives of their communities and organizations through participation because it guarantees more sustainable development.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  For the game session, participants are selected according to criteria based on goals and objectives. Participants do not necessarily have to have gaming experience or be game geeks. The recommended age of participants is 12+.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Upon entering the game, players are assigned distinct demographic roles, such as policeman, migrant, doctor, entrepreneur, or farmer. Each role, accompanied by its professional background, income, expenses, and life bonuses, offers unique opportunities and challenges. Players live and play within these roles until the game concludes.  Every game round is equivalent to an electoral cycle consisting of three phases: collective decisions, individual activity or decision-making, and collective actions.  In each round, players elect a mayor from among themselves, who guides the game according to the rules. Players must devise their electoral system and demonstrate leadership skills, as the game doesn't prescribe a specific procedure for electing a mayor.  Players must navigate through each phase, managing their salary, paying taxes, determining cost structures, and directing their energy towards activities leading to their individual goals. You can choose to play for the group goal or personal victory.  Furthermore, players will encounter pleasant and stressful life circumstances throughout the game. I would need to acknowledge these and deal with them.  Throughout the game, players must make numerous decisions, individually and collectively, providing an immersive simulation of community life.  In essence, ""World of Communities"" offers an intricate, participatory experience that involves decision-making, leadership, negotiation, and role-playing, all geared towards individual and collective success.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  The ""World of Communities"" game provides an immersive experience, eliciting a broad spectrum of emotions from players - everything from initial rejection and denial to bouts of Homeric laughter and even tears. A Game Master moderator leads each session and concludes with a debriefing or reflection phase, where participants exchange thoughts, new experiences, and emotions, share contacts, and discuss plans and actions.  The game not only facilitates a smooth learning process but also accelerates self-development and diagnosis, relationship development and diagnosis, and the generation of group-created solutions. Each session is a unique opportunity for growth and insight.  Systematic engagement with the ""World of Communities"" has led to observable changes in its players. 67% reported improved relationships with others, 65% noticed an enhancement in their leadership skills, and 63% learned to approach problems from a broader perspective. The game inspired 59% to collaborate with others to solve common issues, 57% to instigate changes, and 55% reported increased motivation to participate in community life.  Practically speaking, the game finds usage in various fields. 69% use it for education on community development tools, while 52% leverage it to activate people and engage them in more intricate processes. It's utilized for team building (49%), developing financial and entrepreneurial skills (45%), and identifying hidden leaders (44%). The game also aids in understanding people's behavior and nature (37%) and even forms a part of community strategic planning (18%).  In conclusion, the ""World of Communities"" game is a transformative tool that substantially improves interpersonal relations, problem-solving abilities, and leadership skills while fostering active participation in community life.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The ""World of Communities"" board game is a versatile tool applied across business, education, culture, civil society, personal development, youth, and community sectors. It fosters team building, decision-making, leadership skills, soft skills, and socializing. It promotes change in behavior and systemic models, while aiding in various practical applications such as HR recruitment, needs assessment, project management, bullying prevention, partner diagnosis, and more. This game is a holistic instrument for developing individual and community competencies, fostering constructive social behavior, and promoting active citizen participation.

This is prompted by their commitment to democratic principles. It is also prompted by the growing and now widespread perception that government leaders pay little attention to the voice of the people.  Standard public opinion polls tend to only be an effective means of consulting citizens on issues for which they have already given significant thought.  Mini-publics, such as citizen assemblies, are better suited for complex issues that require deliberation, but are often costly and can take over a year from start to finish.  Public consultation surveys are a middle ground between the two. The surveys can be designed and fielded within a few months, while still providing participants with the necessary information and array of viewpoints necessary to make an informed decision on real policy. The goal is for respondents to have a self-contained deliberative experience that simulates that of a policymaker.  Origins and Development  Public consultation surveys have been used since the 1990s in the US.The American Talks Issue Foundation led by Alan Kay played a pioneering role.The largest such program is the Program for Public Consultation at the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy, directed by Steven Kull, conducting public consultation surveys on the national level, as well as in states and congressional districts. They have gathered public opinion data on over 300 policy proposals that have been put forward by Members of Congress and the Executive Branch, in a variety of areas. Such surveys conducted in particular Congressional districts have also been used as the basis for face-to-face forums in congressional districts, in which survey participants and House Congressional Representative discuss the policy proposals and the results of the survey.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Samples are collected using the same methods for standard polling: through probability-based methods, or opt-in panels. The sample is then weighted to be representative of the population, with regards to key demographics and partisan affiliation.  How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  Public consultation surveys are conducted online, and taken individually. For each issue, respondents are provided relevant briefing materials, introduced to a policy proposal or position, and read or evaluate arguments for and against various proposals.Respondents then provide their final recommendation on whether they favor or oppose the policy proposal or position.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Public consultation surveys have been cited extensively in the media, as well as by legislators, to show where the majority of the public stands on federal policies. The surveys that have been most prominent are those on issues too complex for standard polls, including: how to address the Social Security shortfall, net neutrality regulations, the US' nuclear weapons posture, and immigration.  They have also been used as the basis for face-to-face forums in congressional districts in the US. A representative sample of that district takes the survey, some of the respondents then meet in person with their House Congressional Representative, and local news media, to discuss the policy proposals and the results of the survey.

However, successfully establishing citizen security policies requires a certain threshold of necessary resources to implement security policies. I​​n Latin American states lacking resources and effective security policies, participatory security provides a more feasible solution to citizen security.A typology of participatory security has been constructed to better understand the incentives for this relatively new concept [4]. The two most critical variables areBureaucratic Capacity and Resources(capacity) andPolice-Society Relations(relations). Where police capacity to maintain public safety is high, and relations are cohesive, there is little incentive for citizen involvement because the public trusts the police, and the police do not require the contributions of the public. Where there is high capacity, and relations are fractious, government oversight is both desirable and achievable – government and police oversight over citizens is likely, and there is, again, little incentive for the government to invite citizen participation in security. It is when capacity is low that incentives for participatory security grow significantly. Where relations are cohesive and capacity low,auxiliaryparticipatory security is most likely – participation is widespread due to mutual police-citizen trust and incentive to compensate for lacking capacity, and space is created for citizen input “identify[ing] the most pressing local problems, thereby helping police to better direct the deployment of scarce resources” [2].A fractious, low-capacity scenario is the most likely to incentivizethinparticipatory security – participation is carefully restricted, police face few obligations, and citizens hold minimal authority. Figure 1 [4]An overarching incentive for governments to implement participatory security has been likened to a “safety valve” [4]. Citizens often view state security forces as incompetent and even criminal in states where security forces function under capacity. The “safety valve” provides a realistic, achievable strategy for governments to alleviate public pressure calling for reforms. Rather than devising legislation to allocate greater funding to police forces, develop stricter methods for preventing corruption, or increase policing efficiency, a tedious and costly process, states may attempt to placate their citizenry with disingenuous promises of greater political influence and participation.Governments may also incorporate participatory security to rebuild relationships between citizens and states. This public solution, which requires and encourages citizen involvement, expands police-parallel presence throughout communities. Its goal is not to scare community members into compliance but to provide more opportunities for them to use state channels to solve security problems rather than relying on paramilitary or other elicit methods of security enforcement [2]. This method helps to reestablish state legitimacy and encourage citizen reliance on legal, public services. Furthermore, this converts civilians into a sort of “alarm system” that can act as a middleman between crimes/threats and security forces. Implementing these aspects of participatory security thus allows police to focus their limited resources and capacity on security enforcement more efficiently, and subsequent improvements in police effectiveness may thus improve police trust and relations.Origins and DevelopmentSince the beginning of the 1980s, countries across Latin America have made a notable transition toward democratization. Pressure from the West, as well as dissatisfaction with the authoritarian regimes of the 1970s, signaled a new era of Latin American politics focused not on the historical legacy of elitist, limited democracies but on the creation of participatory structures aimed at inclusion and receptive to the increasingly mobilized civil societies across the continent [7]. Among these participatory reforms were implementations of participatory security measures in response to rising distrust between the citizenry and state police forces in three main areas: São Paulo State, Brazil, Columbia, and Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. The concept of participatory security was not created until a few decades after these institutions. While there is no clear creator of this method, Dr. Yanilda Marie Gonzalez has heavily researched the concept, and much of the theory behind this work can be attributed to her [2].São Paulo State was the first government to install participatory security structures as a measure to rebuild trust between citizens and police. Heralded in by Governor André Franco Montoro, the state’s first democratically elected governor after years of oppressive military rule, the Community Security Council (CONSEGs) was founded in 1985 as a method to support under-resourced police activity as well as provide a more robust police-citizen relationship [6]  .The CONSEGs arose out of Montoro's previous failures to reform the Military Police (MP) as well as the civil police, two notoriously corrupt institutions under the previous military dictatorship, due to police backlash [4]. Unlike the later cases of Columbia and Buenos Aires, the relations between citizens and police officers in São Paulo were reasonably cohesive, and participatory security was installed as a means to accommodate the under-resourced police forces. “By definition, CONSEG are entities made up of groups of people from the same neighborhood or municipality, who come together to discuss and analyze, plan and monitor the solution of their community security problems, develop educational campaigns and strengthen ties of understanding and cooperation between several local leaders” [6]. These CONSEGs were informed that they were serving as part of the police force as well as helping them structure it. Participants were told they were the “eyes and ears of the police,” whose purpose was to assist in the actual criminal investigations without telling police what to do[4]. However, due to the better relations between police and citizens, as well as Montoro’s failure at broader police reform, there was little incentive to create substantial accountability measures for citizens to ensure the police enforce their decisions and left the police largely uncontrolled despite community meetings.Eight years after the implementation of São Paulo’s CONSEGs, Columbia instituted a similar strategy of participatory security to handle the lack of police resources as well as the strained relationship between citizens and police. Unlike the CONSEGs, which were a single policy reform, Columbia’s National System of Citizen Participation included various broad police reforms to reduce crime and corruption across the country [8]. This authority was composed of an executive, the police, and representatives from various social groups. The primary functions of the National Police and Citizen Participation Commission were to: “Propose policies to strengthen the preventive action of the Police; Promote citizen participation; Recommend plans and programs; Channel complaints; Encourage National Police agents to provide service in their regions of origin” [8]. However, the powers of the social group participants were relatively weak as there was no specified power to hold their police accountable, while executive authorities were given complete power over the police, creating an imbalanced commission [4].The Dirty War in Argentina created some of the most substantial mistrust between police and citizens on the continent. By the time the Buenos Aires province began considering a participatory security structure, the police had become known asla maldita policia(the bloody police). Police-citizen relationships were entirely adversarial when Buenos Aires founded thevecinales de seguridad(neighborhood security forums) as a method of resolving this conflict [12]. These forums focused on community coalition building as well as creating a more responsive police force with an emphasis on crime prevention. While São Paulo and Columbia’s participatory institutions have since maintained their formal structures, the Buenos Aires forums have been shut down and reinstated multiple times due to changing Argentine politics (especially by Security Minister Arslanián, who purged the police force eight times to fight corruption until the forums were officially shut down in 2007) [12].Participant Recruitment and SelectionWithin the three discussed instances of participatory security, public participation has widely varied due to differing levels of trust and accessibility. While in theory, participatory institutions are open to all citizens, they face practical issues of “asymmetrical citizenship,” where, due to socioeconomic differences, some citizens’ voices are treated as more or less valuable [3]. The issue of asymmetrical citizenship can affect membership and challenge the ideas of these spaces as representative of their states. Columbia’s National System of Citizen Participation made an effort to solve this issue by only requiring a single representative from various civic and social groups, such as unions, businesses, universities, ethnic minorities, and others, to be present at each meeting [12]. This quota system made participation quite inaccessible as each social group was only allocated one position on these boards, regardless of social group size. The Buenos Aires forums created a similarly limited participatory structure where only “nongovernmental community organizations and entities with recognized social participation” were allowed into forums and given authority which limited the ability of socially unconnected individuals to participate in the decisions on their security force [8].How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-Making  The ProcessParticipatory security promises citizens in large cities inclusion in public governance through civil participation that impacts security and policing policies. Participatory mechanisms allow politicians to strategically divide and distribute responsibility to manage social and public dissatisfaction with procedures or policies [4]. As discussed above, according to Dr. González, participatory mechanisms act as “safety valves” that control discontent and pressures for reform while improving the public image of politicians and police departments. González further explains that participatory security is “more likely to be a top-down policy response to politicians’ strategic incentives than the direct result of a bottom-up demand.” Top-down policies occur when decisions are made at the highest level and then communicated to lower levels or departments. It is understood that once new rules or procedures are received, they will be followed and enforced.Planning, Preparations, and ResourcesIn the case of the Buenos Aires province in Argentina, it was hard to raise awareness for participation at first; attitudes were negative towards participation, community members did not know what was happening, and there was distrust in the policing institution [4]. Because of this negativity and unsureness, advocates of participatory security were deterred from planning and making any preparations. However, the province police and advocates for a more participatory system were able to form the neighborhood security forums (  vecinales de seguridad  ). More in-depth research and analysis of established participatory security institutions need to be made in order to determine how countries, cities, and provinces plan and prepare and what resources went into forming and sustaining the participation.Participants and InteractionsMost interactions between participants happen through open public meetings designed for discussions, with an emphasis on stating and addressing a problem and then sorting out a solution. During these meetings, participants have the opportunity to interact with each other, government officials, and organizers. Participants make up all aspects of the community, from business owners to teachers, retired individuals, and people experiencing homelessness. They also include organizations and advocates of marginalized people like sex workers, LGBTQ+ youth, and drug users [3]. Most CONSEGs are active and meet regularly; in 2011, there were an average of 47 participants, and 86.4% of meetings had 25 or more attendees [3]. While there is information on who participants are and how they interact with each other and city officials, it is unclear how meetings are facilitated and conducted, like if discussions are made through rounds or stages.Decision-makingMore research is needed when it comes to policies and decisions made by community members in a participatory institution, such as participatory security [4]. Scholars on participatory security have recommended that future research should be directed toward citizen demands of policies that affect safety, policing, and security, and how their demands can be equally distributed in policies or other democratic processes. From what is known in Brazil, Columbia, and Argentina, decisions are made using this method, with an emphasis on community collaboration and input, but the specifics of the decisions are not well reported by these institutions [2][3][4].Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsOn paper, the success or failure of a participatory security policy should be measured by how much it promotes citizen equality and democratic involvement. The intended outcomes of participatory security are clear: as a method of democratic participation, participatory security should promote policing institutions that serve the needs of the public and not the whims of government leaders. Relationships and trust should be built between police and citizens, and citizens should feel confident that they will be treated legally and fairly when they are in contact with police. Above all, participatory security should be a method for achieving universalized security and promoting democratic processes. These expected outcomes of participatory security are ideal, which is why many Latin American states chose to institutionalize participatory security in response to rising rates of crime and political corruption.However, theoretical methods of democratic participation rarely mirror the implementation and practice of those methods, especially in newly democratic nations. A participatory security policy’s success or failure is contingent upon how closely its implementation follows its formal design [5].As is clear in the above case studies, the effects of actual participatory security policies extend beyond the intended outcome of promoting democratic participation.Perhaps the most harmful effect of participatory security is that it institutionalizes police control over how citizens access and experience security. Author Yanilda González classifies the police impact on citizenship in terms of the level of security being provided and the distribution of that security across citizens [5].When security provisions are deficient, the effect is constrained citizenship, which is characterized by “impediments to the practice of the civil, social, and political dimensions of citizenship due to alienation from other citizens and state institutions” [5]. When security is distributed unequally, and some citizens are provided more security than others, the result is stratified citizenship. Stratified citizenship legitimizes existing inequalities, especially along lines of race, class, and geography. According to González, the effect of participatory security on citizenship can be viewed as a negative feedback loop: “Citizenship becomes effectively constrained by deficient protection, while stratification limits the power and ability of marginalized citizens to articulate demands for protection—including protection from state repression—thereby further constraining citizenship for marginalized communities” [5]. Deficient security provisions and unequally distributed security rob citizens of their basic rights to safety and protection from harm.Analysis and Lessons LearnedThe influences, effects, and outcomes of participatory security suggest that in its current form, participatory security is not an effective method to promote democratic participation and equality. Universalized security cannot be attained in a state with prominent inequalities, but addressing those inequalities is incredibly difficult for unstable, newly democratic governments. Implementing participatory security promotes theideaof democratic processes, but the inherently flawed design of participatory security prevents citizens from meaningfully accessing those processes.Until participatory institutions can codify citizen decisions and delegate legitimate authority to citizens over state security forces, these issues will persist and may prevent participatory security from being an effective tool for handling security imbalances in a state.Some scholars have contended that the flaws seen in the execution of participatory security models suggest that participation itself cannot be direct. Anthropologist Kairos Marquardt wrote that democratic participation is “by nature filtered through layers of historical relationships and experiences, and as such it is highly exclusionary” [9]. Some scholars have contended that the structural imbalances in participation mean that participatory security institutions cannot respond to the needs of underserved populations.Other scholars argue that modifications to the method will enable participatory security to achieve democratic equality. In order to mitigate the influence of corrupt political leaders over the implementation of participatory security policies, citizen power, and autonomy should be legally protected in such policies. Participatory security occurs in settings where there is little trust in police and limited police resources- two conditions that automatically hinder the potential of participatory security mechanisms. In the future, participatory security policies must normalize citizen power over security decisions to improve public opinion of police.Finally, it is important to note that the existing research into the practice and effects of participatory security is limited. For a more extensive understanding of participatory security and its capacity to achieve democratic goals, case studies and the method itself must be further examined. Most research has been completed regarding participatory security in Latin American countries, but these studies are not representative of every participatory security policy. There are several fascinating examples of citizen security solutions in African and South Asian countries that warrant further research [13] [14].See Also  References[1] Elsen, J. R. (2016).

It has various purposes and easily connects the government and its residents. [1]",0,2023-12-12,2023-12-12,426023,locampo,https://participedia.net/user/426023,426023,locampo,https://participedia.net/user/426023,en,,online,involve,,,,,longterm, community, evaluation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Problems and PurposeIn Bogotá, Colombia, citizens struggled to have their complaints heard by the city while officials, on the other hand, struggled to organize, track down, and answer their numerous critiques. There would be hour-long lines to hospitals, unfixed potholes in the streets, and painstakingly long and confusing paperwork for the city to be completed among a multitude of other problems. Often these complaints went unfixed as it was so poorly organized that the proper authorities responsible for the sectors wouldn't hear of the problems and the circumstances would stay the same. Citizens were left unsatisfied with the city due to this and so, to provide a solution to their problems, Bogotá created a user-friendly app and website, named Bogotá te Escucha, that allowed residents one place to easily ask questions and make complaints while officials could efficiently respond to them. The purpose of the app was to increase attentiveness to the needs of residents in Bogotá, efficiently save time, and create positive views of the city. [1]Origins and DevelopmentHaving noted the slow response from officials and receiving numerous complaints unhappy with the city, officials decided to rework their Citizen Input Data Dashboard that received the complaints and create an app that was easily accessible. These were created with residents in mind and made as user-friendly as possible by using easy-to-understand language, geo-coded maps, and charts to view complaints while also having numerous other methods displayed to create requests to the city government. [2]To ensure that this program would be as straightforward as possible, the city created focus groups and actively engaged with residents in Bogotá to receive feedback and learn what they could do to improve user-friendliness and meet the needs of their citizens. These groups were crucial to the development of the app as they provided suggestions that were tailored to the needs of Bogotá’s citizens. [1]Once the dashboard and app were created, the city increased awareness by designing a naming contest for the app and site. Residents would propose names for the programs by a deadline and then vote on which name they liked the most. The name that was chosen was “Bogotá te Escucha” meaning Bogotá Listens to You.Participant Recruitment and SelectionBogotá te Escucha is open to the entirety of the city as it was created to make requests, report problems and make the quality of life better for residents. The app and website are accessible by anyone, even those who do not reside in Bogotá. All that is needed to have access to it is an account on Bogotá te Escucha which can be used to directly contact the city for any important questions or petitions.It aims to bridge the gap between citizens and the city government. It strongly encourages all residents in Bogotá to participate, showing videos explaining the steps to file a petition. It also has a portal designed for children which can be used in the classrooms and accustom them to engage more with the city government. [1]How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-MakingTo use Bogotá te Escucha, an account must first be made to sign onto the website. Then on the site, you can choose to create a petition by a press of a button and this will be done anonymously. Once it is filed, it provides you with a petition number which needs to be saved for later. After the petition is filed, the number can be used to track whether officials have responded to it. You can take action and respond if there are any doubts or questions regarding the proposal through the portal. Then once the proper authorities receive it, they will eventually respond or confirm that an issue is fixed, etc. In the end, the petition will be closed within the system. You may also email or call to report issues through the contact information provided on the site.[3] [4]Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsBogotá te Escucha has created positive outcomes within the community. Before, the slow responsiveness and low attention to the needs of residents generated negative views of the city while there were persisting problems that went unheard. With the new app and website, Bogotá has made a stronger connection with its citizens that made them feel much more valued which is shown through testimonies made by Bogotá residents. It also increased efficiency and saved time as the app and website automatically organized the petitions for the city. Overall, problems within Bogota were solved faster and it boosted engagement with their residents. [1]Analysis and Lessons LearnedAn important aspect that allowed Bogotá te Escucha to succeed was the amount of feedback and engagement they received from their residents.

Converj is led by Chad Brower  .Converj has independently arrived at solutions similar toConsiderIt  ,Tricider  , andKialo  , which all support forms of online structured deliberation.Participant Recruitment and SelectionOnce a host creates a survey, they distribute the survey's private link through their group's existing communication systems, such as email lists or group chats.Anybody with the link can immediately participate in the survey.Hosts and participants do not have to register.To protect privacy and reduce groupthink, Converj does not track users' identity nor reputation, letting each answer stand on its own merit.How it Works: Process, Interaction, and Decision-MakingConverj’s deliberative formsease the transition from traditional opinion survey forms to deliberative forums.Like a traditional survey, Converj forms can be set up with a simple sequence of questions, including rating, ranking, checklist, multiple choice, write-in, and budget questions.Hosts can suggest answers, and participants can also add new answers.Converj forms incorporate a lightweight type of deliberation. When a participant answers a question, they are asked to include a reason with their answer, encouraging them to both think more deeply about their preference.To reduce the effort of writing a reason for each answer, once the user starts typing a reason, Converj suggests similar existing reasons which the user can click to copy.Converj chooses which reasons to suggest based how much the user’s reason in progress matches the words in the suggested reason, and based on how many other users voted for the suggested reason.The reason suggestions help the participant quickly encounter relevant, high quality reasons, without browsing through low quality reasons.The reason suggestions nudge participants to consider other people's reasons.And the reason suggestions reduce the number of unique reasons that the host has to review.In addition to traditional question types, Converj forms support questions that are more deliberative in intent.For instance, Converj forms can include a proposal for participants to vote for or against.In order to vote on a proposal, the participant must provide their best reason for or against the proposal – or select an existing reason from other participants.This nudges participants to reflect and learn, leading to better quality decisions, and leading to more support for the outcome.For participation earlier in the planning process, Converj provides a question type to request proposals about how to solve a problem, with proposals ranked by their pro and con reasons.And even further upstream, for leaders trying to discover the concerns of a community, there is a question type to request problems that need solving.Little moderation is required, because only the best quality, most relevant user answers are displayed.Immediate results are available to all participants.With Converj, there is no need to choose between surveys versus deliberation, because deliberation is built into a simple survey form.Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsConverj automated deliberation improves the quality of group decisions, makes the leader's job easier, and increases participant support for the outcome.Voting alone does not bring opinions closer together.Competitive voting can even increase partisanship.But Converj's reason-based voting causes people to learn more about their own ideas, and about opposing ideas, finding new common ground.And Converj’s reason suggestions make it easy to express and discover reasons, to make the most of participants' time and effort.Likewise, Converj makes the host's job easier in several ways.Allowing participants to write in new answers, Converj enables the discussion leader to discover opinions that they did not anticipate.This helps prevent upsetting surprises later in the planning process, and sometimes reveals new options that are superior to the ideas that leaders previously considered.And participants are nudged to discover and vote for a few main answers, to make results both representative and clear for reporting.With Converj, leaders don't just collect participants' answers, they reveal why people gave those answers, not in terms of demographics, but in participants' own words.Extremist participants are allowed to speak their mind, without disrupting coherent deliberation.Participants can vote for only one top reason, which makes answer and vote spamming ineffective.Answer length penalties reduce the visibility of answers that ramble on.Vote counts are public, yet deemphasized to reduce bandwagon effects.Opposing opinions are given equal placement, side by side, so that minority viewpoints are not drowned out by the majority.Converj's lightweight deliberation causes groups to provide better quality feedback, with less effort.Analysis and Lessons LearnedUsing Converj, anexperimentcompared the effect of requiring participants to provide only answers, versus requiring participants to also provide reasons for their answers.The experiment results showed that requiring reasons increased the group's accuracy on objective questions, and increased the group's empathy on questions about subjective values.See AlsoAbout ConverjReferencesExternal LinksConverjNotes",0,0,0,1,0,
