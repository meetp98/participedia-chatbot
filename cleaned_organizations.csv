It closed its doors in January 2014.Mission and Purpose  AmericaSpeaks is a non-profit and non-partisan organization that focuses on organizing regional and national citizen meetings. The mission of AmericaSpeaks is to “reinvigorate American democracy by engaging citizens in the public decision-making that most impacts their lives.”  [1]  The primary focus of the meetings is issues that revolve around issues with a significant budget impact. Another focus of AmericaSpeaks is to integrate solid democratic deliberation with  technology  and new media. Their aim for national citizen meetings goes beyond the small groups within a given community. AmericaSpeaks wants to connect citizens not only from different cultural backgrounds, but also geographic backgrounds. This is achieved with the utilization of satellites, keypad  polling , and web conferences in order to connect citizens across the nation.  In addition to civic and technological engagement, AmericaSpeaks seeks to expand academia’s knowledge on the deliberative process. A subgroup of AmericaSpeaks known as the Democracy Lab for Research and Innovation has three goals in this field. They aim to “expand our knowledge about the practice of public deliberation, develop new and better ways to engage citizens to improve democratic processes and institutions, and foster and increase collaboration within the field of deliberative democracy.”  [2]  AmericaSpeaks envisions that their citizen forums will inspire the ""public's business [to] be conducted differently - that by developing a rich national infrastructure for democratic deliberation through our projects, innovation and collaboration, [government] can access the collective wisdom of the American people.”  [3]   Origins and Development  AmericaSpeaks was founded in 1995. Since then, it has engaged over 145,000 people in over 50 large-scale forums in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. AmericaSpeaks aims to bring citizens together to deliberate about critical policy issues. The conclusions from these meetings are then brought to the attention of decision-makers in the hopes that citizen input will influence policy.  In 1994, after more than ten years of service in the public sector, AmericaSpeaks president Carolyn Lukensmeyer had grown concerned that citizens were increasingly being shut out of public decision-making processes. Carolyn traveled the United States and held vision meetings to conceptualize a model for large-scale citizen engagement forums, and a vision for how these forums could be used in national dialogues on key public policy issues. AmericaSpeaks’ mission is to create innovative mechanisms through which citizens can enhance their voice in local, regional, and national governance, and to renew democracy through the development of a national infrastructure for democratic deliberation and citizen engagement.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  AmericaSpeaks is non-partisan and non-profit organization that receives its funding from over 90 current and recent contributors. Some major contributors include the National 4-H Council, the Pew Charitable Trust Fund, United Nations Environment Programme, the World Economic Fourm, in addition to many cities being direct contributors.  [5]   Some events, such as the Our Budget, Our Economy National Town Meeting, have recieved special or one-time grants from philanthropic organizations like the the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, E.K. Kellogg Foundation, and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.  [6]   Specializations, Methods and Tools  AmericaSpeaks has developed and facilitated deliberative methods such as the  21st Century Town Meeting , which enables facilitated discussion for 500 to 5,000 participants.  AmericaSpeaks’  21st Century Town Meeting  is intended to create engaging, meaningful opportunities for citizens to participate in public decision making. This process attempts to update the traditional  New Englandtown meeting  to address the needs of today’s citizens, decision makers and democracy. Unlike most of New England's town meetings, however, it is not a formal legislative body, and therefore none of the decisions are binding.  The 21st Century Town Meeting marks a departure from traditional public participation methods, such as public hearings. The 21st Century Town Meeting focuses on discussion and deliberation among citizens rather than speeches, question-and-answer sessions or panel presentations. The purpose of the Town Hall Meeting is to gather diverse groups of citizens who will participate in round-table discussions (10-12 people per table) and deliberate in depth about key policy issues. Each table discussion is supported by a trained facilitator to keep participants on task. Participants receive discussion guides that present further information about the issues under consideration.  Technology collects the individual table discussions and the results are compiled into a set of collective recommendations. Each table submits ideas using wireless groupware computers and each participant can vote on specific proposals with keypad polling. These two pieces of technology allow for real-time reporting and voting. Results from discussions are presented to participants within minutes and polling results within seconds. The entire group votes on the final recommendations to submit to decision makers. Before the meeting ends, results from the meeting are put into a report, which is distributed to participants, decision makers and the news media as they leave.  Major Projects and Events  21st Century Summit  The 21st Century Summit was created to help organization leaders tap into the collective wisdom of their constituents and stakeholders through large-scale meetings. During discussions, participants identify shared priorities and develop recommendations on essential policies and plans. At the meeting, AmericaSpeaks attempts to help attendees explore key issues, weigh critical trade offs, and deepen their connection and commitment to next steps. AmericaSpeaks has more than a decade of experience with engaging large numbers of members, employees or stakeholders – 50 to 5,000 at a single meeting – in a strategic, outcomes-oriented discussion. The method integrates recent technology with facilitated dialogue, and provides the tools to enable groups to examine important options and identify mutual priorities.Americans Discuss Social Security""Americans Discuss Social Security"" was a 1998 non-partisan effort funded by The Pew Charitable Trusts, that directly engaged a diverse sample of Americans in a dialogue about Social Security (United States)|Social Security reform and recommended that the United States Congress support legislation that reflected citizen preferences. Over fifteen months, the project engaged nearly 45,000 Americans in every state in direct discussions on Social Security reform and reached more than twelve million through the project’s media and public education efforts.  Citizen Summits in Washington, DC  Beginning in 1999 and lasting until 2005, Mayor Anthony Williams partnered with AmericaSpeaks in an attempt to restore Washingtonians' faith in the government and gather recommendations for budgeting allocation. Over 13,500 citizens participated in seven 21st Century Town Meetings.  Because of the Citizen Summits, millions of dollars were budgeted to areas over which citizens voiced concern, including: an additional $270 million for education; $10 million for senior services; 1,000 new drug treatment slots; an additional $25 million for a housing trust fund; $2 million for citizen involvement; and nearly $20 million for more police and juvenile-related initiatives. Also, the mayor's office created and implemented the Office of Neighborhood Action, which is responsible for ensuring that citizens have a voice in shaping the city’s priorities.  Redeveloping Ground Zero  Listening to the City was held at the Javits Center in New York City in July 2002 to involve 4300 local citizens, who closely reflected the demographic diversity of the region, in the planning process for Ground Zero's future. Decision-makers from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and the Port Authority co-sponsored the meeting and incorporated it into their official public engagement process. After a day of intense deliberation, participants determined that the original plans for the redevelopment of the World Trade Center failed to meet the needs of the city. Within a week of Listening to the City, decision-makers announced that the plans would be redrawn in accordance with public priorities. A two-week online deliberation and dialogue reached another 800 New York City residents who reviewed the site options in small cyber groups.  2005 World Economic Forum  The 2005 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland featured a Global  Town Hall  Meeting by AmericaSpeaks’ international arm, Global Voices, where 700 world leaders prioritized and addressed some of the toughest issues facing the global community. Poverty and Equitable Globalization were voted the two top priorities.  Meeting of the Minds: European Citizens' Deliberate on Brain Science  Over the course 2005, 126 citizens met up a handful of times within their own country and twice with citizens from other countries in order to discuss “the ethical, social, and legal implications of brain science policy and technology.” Participating nations included Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungry, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.  [4]  The focus of the discussion was broken up into 6 themes: regulation and control, normalcy vs. diversity, information and communication, equal access to treatment, pressure from economic interests, and freedom of choice.  After these meetings, the citizens turned in a summary of their findings in January of 2006 to the European Parliament. These recommendations and insights were later used by other organizations such as the European Group on Ethics in Science, the European Union, and New Technologies. This project was run by the pan-national department of AmericaSpeaks, known as  Global Voices.Our Budget, Our EconomyThousands of citizens from 20 major cities are expected to participate in a national discussion set to take place on June 26, 2010. Unlike previous AmericaSpeak forums, this will be the first of their forums that will have different cities simultaneously and collectively participate with others. 32 individuals from Institutions such as the Heritage Foundation plus local outreach partners will comprise AmericaSpeak’s Nation Advisory Committee that will oversee the proceedings. These people will act as moderators and advisors for the meetings.  The main issue of the forum is the recent budget crisis and discussing solutions to the nation’s recession. After the meeting has taken place, the opinions and recommendations of the participants will be condensed into a report that will be presented to the National Commission on Responsibility and Reform and the Bi-Partisan Policy Center’s Debt Reduction Task Force.PartnershipsVoices &amp; Choices  AmericaSpeaks partnered with the Fund for Our Economic Future to organize a series of town meetings and public forums across northeast Ohio to enable thousands of people to come together to create a strategic plan for revitalizing the region's economy. One of the largest public deliberations convened, Voices &amp; Choices combined a variety of approaches for mobilizing the region’s citizenry, including one-on-one interviews, online forums and two large-scale 21st Century Town Meetings. Over 20,000 participants identified the region’s strengths, identified and prioritized its most important challenges and brainstormed solutions.  Citizens' Health Care Working Group  AmericaSpeaks worked with the Citizens' Health Care Working Group to engage thousands of Americans in a national discussion on health care reform. 21st Century Town Meetings were held in Los Angeles and Cincinnati. Smaller forums were held in other cities throughout the nation.  Unified New Orleans Plan  AmericaSpeaks partnered with the Unified New Orleans Plan to bring together nearly 4000 New Orleanians in two large-scale public meetings to develop and review elements of a city wide-plan for recovery. The December 2006 and January 2007 Community Congresses were multi-site meetings that connected participants over geographical distances using satellite video and webcast.  Community Congress II (December 2 2006) and Community Congress III (January 20, 2007) were both held simultaneously in New Orleans and other American cities with the large numbers of Katrina evacuees (New Orleans diaspora). AmericaSpeaks partnered with the Unified New Orleans Plan to design, recruit participants and implement these meetings. When polled at the meetings, the participant groups closely approximated the pre-Katrina demographics of New Orleans: In pre-Katrina New Orleans, 67% were African-American and 37% had household income under $20,000; at Community Congress II, 64% were African-American and 25% had household income under $20,000; at Community Congress III, 55% were African-American and 24% had household income under $20,000. Renters, however, were significantly underrepresented - prior to Hurricane Katrina, 54% of the population were renters, while they made up only 29% of the participants.  The meetings connected New Orleanians at home with friends and neighbors who have not yet made it home through the use of Internet webcast technology or closed circuit television. Community Congress III presented the draft plan to citizens, incorporating many of the recommendations from Community Congress II, and 92% of participants expressed support for the Plan to go forward.  In late May 2007, $117 million in federal block grants was released for infrastructure repairs when the Louisiana Recovery Authority board accepted New Orleans' citywide recovery plan. The money is the first step toward financing a city recovery plan officials say will cost $1.1 billion. When releasing the money, The Louisiana Recovery Authority board recognized that the Unified New Orleans Plan was a citizen- driven recovery vision developed with ""unprecedented participation and representation from every part of the city.""  CaliforniaSpeaks  Nearly 3,500 Californians gathered in eight cities on August 11, 2007 in an interactive forum on health care priorities called  CaliforniaSpeaks , and 82 percent advocated major changes. The project was created and led by AmericaSpeaks.  The most popular suggestions called for putting people before profit, prioritizing wellness and prevention, and making health care affordable and accessible to everyone. The statewide conversation was created to enable ordinary Californians to tell state lawmakers what they think about the current health care reform proposals. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez, Senate President pro Tem Don Perata, Assembly Republican Leader Mike Villines and other Republican and Democratic legislators attended the event. Each of the lawmakers emphasized his commitment to passing health care reform in 2007.  The real-time, nonpartisan health care discussion blended small-group dialogue with cutting-edge technology. Satellite television, webcast, simultaneous television broadcast, groupware and individual voting keypads were used. Forums were held in Sacramento, San Diego, Eureka, Fresno, Los Angeles, San Luis Obispo, Oakland-San Francisco and Riverside-San Bernardino.  Democracy Lab for Innovative and Research  AmericaSpeaks is dedicated to advancing citizen deliberation and aims to one day create an infrastructure in the United States that deeply incorporates citizens into the decision-making process. The Democracy Lab for Innovation and Research is AmericaSpeaks’ think tank on deliberative democracy and citizen engagement. The  Democracy Lab  develops methods to advance and sustain citizen engagement in the public policy process. AmericaSpeaks formed the Democracy Lab in order to: Improve democratic processes and institutions by creating a new governance mechanism that will regularly convene diverse groups of Americans on key policy questions and incorporate citizen voices into policy making; Enhance and improve AmericaSpeaks’ approach to citizen engagement, such as developing new models for sustaining citizen participation and turning initial participation in deliberation into long-term citizen engagement and action; Evaluate the impact of AmericaSpeaks’ citizen engagement initiatives; Strengthen the deliberative democracy field by disseminating knowledge gained by AmericaSpeaks through its projects and research. AmericaSpeaks routinely brings together leading scholars and practitioners from the field of deliberative democracy to develop insights into and solutions for key questions in the field of citizen engagement.

They wondered whether greater participation of the public in political processes could lead to better, fairer, more sustainable decisions, and, if so, how this could best be achieved.  During 2008, the Partnership for Public Participation was formed to research experiences and results of public participation throughout the world, but particularly in three European countries of interest to the partners: Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. This led directly to the report, Public Participation in Europe,[1] which highlighted three key factors that need to be addressed for public participation to be effective:A clearly defined constitutional framework for public participation. Only through an explicit, shared understanding between politicians and citizens can confidence be developed and public participation realize its democratizing potential.  A systematic approach to public participation methods to help organizers of public participation processes choose the most suitable and effective methods.  Rigorous and challenging evaluation of public participation in practice to develop a culture of learning about participation and advance the systematization of participation methods.EIPP was launched on 1 January 2009 specifically to address these issues.Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  EIPP is a not-for-profit organisation which receives core funding from its founder members and project funding from clients to undertake research, evaluation and dissemination activities.Specializations, Methods and Tools  EIPP is involved in three main activities.Research  Undertaking research into public participation activities, mainly, but not exclusively, in Europe. Examples of this include the research undertaken across Europe in 2008 as the basis for the Public Participation in Europe report, and a current project for the  Bertelsmann Foundation  carrying out a detailed analysis of participatory methods in Germany.Evaluation  The key to understanding what works, when in public participation is rigorous evaluation, based not simply on feedback from the participants, but on a set of predefined extrinsic criteria such as: did it result in fairer, more sustainable, more legitimate decisions? EIPP has recently completed a major evaluation of  BürgerForum Europa , a large-scale participatory process over eight months, which developed understanding of how German citizens view the future of Europe and involved politicians at the highest level (including German Chancellor, Angela Merkel).  EIPP is currently developing the European Evaluation Framework for Public Participation with partners across Europe and looking to test this with a range of live participation activities, including  Participatory Budgeting  in the UK.Dissemination of What Works, When  EIPP seeks to disseminate the findings of its research and evidence-based evaluation through any appropriate channels such asreports, e.g. Public Participation in Europe  newspaper articles, e.g.  Rezepte gegen die Europamüdigkeitbroadcast interviews, e.g.  Quest'Europa s'ha da fareconferences and seminarsMajor Projects and EventsCitizens' Forum EuropeAnalysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

According to  their website : ""SARL Sopinspace was the subject of a simple liquidation on December 31, 2016. The operation and marketing of the co-ment® on-line text annotation tool continues with the company Abilian SAS until end of 2017. The update and development of the COMT software that runs co-ment is the subject of a program currently being implemented by the Commons Conservancy Foundation. The sopinspace.com website is maintained for information on our past activities.""Mission and Purpose  The firm's policy is guided by two main principles: to make possible for all citizens, in full respect of their diversity of opinions, to build and express their views in quality debates; and to provide decision makers with reliable input on the landscape or arguments, preferences, positions and options, as to enable better public policy or organisation/company strategy choices.  The firm assists local communities, regions, public agencies and private firms with the design of online participatory platforms according to their particular needs and requirements. It develops innovative software solutions for online debates and consultations, provides consulting services and help with the integration of its software on a variety of online platforms.  In addition to the design and development of participatory platforms, Sopinspace offers its services in management, moderation, mapping and synthesis of ongoing debates. The firm's debate teams usually constitute of a cartographer who maintains the debate map, a media monitor who follows the general or specialized news on the debate's subject and informs the participants on relevant developments, a fact finder who searches (on request) for facts needed to validate or invalidate arguments, a scientific mediator who summarizes and comments on scientific papers and reports to make them more accessible for laypeople, etc.  Sopinspace also operates a French speaking collaborative blog and information resource on on-line debates and their tools.ProductsSince its foundation the firm has developed several free software products  [1] .  1. Co-ment®  [2] : a Web 2.0 text annotation application that allows users to upload texts, post comments and collaboratively edit texts. Users may enclose comments and responses to every word in the text. The scope of application of co-ment is much wider than on-line debates, but it has interesting applications in this domain. co-ment can be seamlessly integrated in Drupal sites thanks to the Drupal co-ment module  [3] .  2. Glinkr®  [4] : this Web service enables to produce graphical interactive maps of Web contents. In the context of online debates, such maps represent the structure of arguments and viewpoints brought up in the discussion. The structure of the map is flexible and it may evolve and changes according to the development of a discussion.  Glinkr  3. Tools for the collective evaluation of proposals or stakes to be debated, using graduated notation techniques. These tools are classical in the offline world since the  Régnier abacus  in the 1980S. On-line analogs have been developed by  Delibera . Sopinspace has implemented several modules for free software content management systems (PlonePriori  [5]  for Plone and a more general Drupal Priorities module  [6] ): these applications allow users to rank or evaluate a list of proposals and obtain a synoptical view of the collective results. This is useful to extract the priorities of users on a list of proposals.  These tools are distributed under free software licenses (GPLv3 or Affero GPLv3)  Co-ment PlonePriori  Notable examplesThe following examples represent some of the online debates which Sopinspace designed and managed.The Open University DebateThe debate was held on April 20-23, 2009 as part of the Biennale Democrazia in Torino (Italy). Its purpose was to discuss the adoption of open access and open source standards in the universities of Torino. Faculty, students and staff of the different universities were invited to participate. The debates drew 1,500 unique visitors in three days, 125 registered users and 300 contributions.  The debates remained open for three days only and proceeded along three tracks. First, a debate on the desirability of becoming an open university. This debate was conducted as part of a discussion forum which users accessed through an interactive map of the debated topics and main arguments (using the Glinkr® tool). Second, a debate on the definition of an open university (based on the Wheeler Declaration), where participants could edit the Wheeler Declaration and comment on it using the co-ment® text annotation service. Third, concrete proposals for action were posted by participants and collectively evaluated by means of a graduated scoring technique (the PlonePriori tool).  At the end of the online debates, Sopinspace produced synthesis documents for each debate track. In parallel, willing participants were invited to act as debate messengers. The role of the debate messengers was to present the results of the online discussions (expressed views and arguments, action proposals, etc) to university decision makers in a physical meeting which concluded the Open University debates. The decision makers were asked to react to the presentations. The Open University project led to some concrete decisions, having the Politecnico di Torino, for instance, committing itself to produce a scoreboard on where it stands in relation to the Wheeler Declaration criteria.The Online Energy Management DebateThe debate was organized by the French Environment and Energy Demand Management agency, in partnership with NGOs and science communication organizations. While most of the debate was conducted online, relying on thematic/argument cartography tools, it also included face-to-face citizen and stakeholders panels.  The debate was held between March 2007 and July 2007. Its aim was to produce a structured set of opinions and constructive proposals. Soliciting the largest possible amount was not the primary objective, but it was essential to obtain a fair representation of the diverse approaches, perceptions and proposals. The site had around 30,000 visits, up to 5,000 unique visitors per month, and 1,600 contributions (most of them rather detailed and well written). The exchanges were always courteous and respected the ethics of debate. The debate was largely uncovered by the media, due to the focus of the media on the upcoming elections in France. A better coverage could have attracted to the debate a greater number of participants who lacked prior awareness of environment and energy issues.  Users who registered on the site (registration was necessary to post contributions, but not for commenting on posts by others) were invited to provided some basic information about themselves. More than 90% of the 435 registered users accepted to do so. The provided data revealed an over-representation of highly-educated participants and an under-representation of blue collar workers. More than 50% of the participants were less than 40 years old and the number of participants aged 18-24 was larger than their share in the general population. The debate benefited from a substantial geographical spread, but only 22% of the participants were women.  The debate was held in 3 stages. During the first one, Internet users were asked to express their views on why energy demand management does not progress better and to formulate proposals on how to overcome the obstacles related to energy management. This stage involved an innovative use of tools for thematic cartography. These tools allowed the moderators of the debate to map the main themes and arguments of the ongoing discussions and offer participants a synoptical view of the debate. Such maps lowered entry barriers into discussions and facilitated the addition of novel contributions. Moderators from Sopinspace updated the maps as the debate developed (participants could comment and object to these updates). According to Sopinspace, such usage of thematic cartography has proved to be useful for maintaining readability and in order to make possible for contradictory exchanges to develop in certain “zones” of the map without preventing other themes to be debated in a constructive manner in other “zones”.  In the second phase, seven multi-stakeholders face-to-face meetings took place in several French cities, bringing together interested citizens, Internet contributors, experts, NGOs, etc. The purpose of these meetings was to discuss the proposals that were brought up online and select 32 of them for a further discussion. The third stage consisted of a new online debate, which aimed to better analyze and refine these 32 proposals.  25 concrete policy or action proposals and 5 discussions without a consensual proposal constituted the outcome of the debate. The latter are on subjects where argumentative exchanges have dominated (primarily on the respective role of renewable energy and nuclear energy for electricity production). 16 of these proposals were sent to decision-makers and included suggestions regarding eco-taxes and direct policies for the transportation field; new incentives for energy saving investments; suggestions regarding a coordinated approach to spatial and city planning, and more. The other proposals were not mature enough and required a further research and discussion.The Online Debate on Wind TurbinesThe debate was held between November 2005 and October 2006, as part of the European DREAM 2 project which aims promote the use of ICT in the region of Nord Pas de Calais. The purpose of the debate was to engage the 12,000 residents of Atrébatie in a discussion on wind energy and its implications for the region. The debate combined an online platform with face-to-face meetings. While the agenda for the debate was developed online, the actual discussion was held in small face-to-face meetings.  The discussion consisted of four stages. During the first stage, participants suggested issues for the debate's agenda. This stage was based on a free flow of ideas and suggestions. During the second stage, participants were asked to rank the suggestions that were brought up on the first stage. The ranking allowed to limit the variety of the suggested ideas to a set of topics that most significantly concerned the participants. The third stage consisted of face-to-face meetings in groups of 12, based on the topics that were prioritized online. At the fourth stage, the synthesis of the face-to-face meetings along with the responses of the municipality officials were posted online.  The website remained open for a month and a half, with an average of 40 visitors per day. During the first stage, 40 participants offered 90 issues for discussion and, at the second stage, 60 participants ranked the proposals. The face-to-face meetings drew over one hundred participants. It is not clear which of the proposals were adopted by the municipality.Further readingExternal LinksSopinspaceFrench speaking Observatory of on-line debates and their toolsPhilippe Aigrain on the WikipediaReferences↑http://www.sopinspace.com/?page_id=65&amp;lang=en↑http://www.co-ment.com↑http://www.sopinspace.com/?p=934&amp;lang=en↑http://www.sopinspace.com/products/glinkr↑http://www.sopinspace.com/products/plonepriori↑http://www.sopinspace.com/?p=214&amp;lang=en",3,0,0,0,0,

Steinberg relied on the ideas of the article by setting up mySociety outside of government and attempting to directly empower the civil society. mySociety has two pronounced missions:  “The first is to be a charitable project which builds websites that give people simple, tangible benefits in the civic and community aspects of their lives. The second is to teach the public and voluntary sectors, through demonstration, how to use the internet most efficiently to improve lives.”[1]  The organization attempts to build minimalistic  websites  which embody cheap scalability and tangible outputs. It is politically neutral and non-partisan.[1] Nearly all its code is open source.[3]Origins and DevelopmentmySociety was founded in September 2003 by Tom Steinberg,[1] and spent the first year raising money and looking for ideas. Its first funding arrived in September 2004, and before the end of 2005 it had three running projects[1]:WriteToThem:  http://writetothem.comPledgeBank:  http://pledgebank.comHearFromYourMP:  http://hearfromyourmp.comIn 2006, mySociety built and launched:No 10 Downing Street Petitions Website: http://petitions.number10.gov.uk  FixMyStreet:  https://fixmystreet.orgTheyWorkForYou:  http://theyworkforyou.comIn 2008, it launched WhatDoTheyKnow ( http://whatdotheyknow.com ) and the FreeOurBills campaign ( http://www.theyworkforyou.com/freeourbills/ ).  A full timeline of mySociety's history is available on their website. [4]Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingInitially, founder and director, Tom Steinberg, was joined by three full-time developers: Angie Ahl, Francis Irving, and Matthew Somerville; a system administrator (Keith); and a commercial director (Karl). A registered charity, the organization substantially relies on volunteer help and encourages all kinds of contributions, including the possibility to run entire sites as part of mySociety (e.g., the PlanningAlerts website designed by Richard Pope). [1]  mySociety's staff works on both charitable and commercial projects; the organization ""charges SocietyWorks Ltd for the staff time used for commercial work.""[5] Many charitable initiatives begin as volunteers' private projects.[5] This work is funded by a multiple means: ""grants from charitable foundations, donations from private individuals, and commercial income from its trading subsidiary.""[6]  mySociety is governed by a volunteer Board of Trustees who oversee the group's activities and ensure compliance with legal requirements.[5]Specializations, Methods and ToolsIn its aims to encourage and facilitate active citizenship, mySociety builds and shares  online technologies . Their research involves ""analysing data, conducting fieldwork, looking at outcomes, assessing reach, and... user interventions,"" all with the hopes of understanding ""the true impact of digital tools on government and civic engagement.""[7]Major Projects and EventsTheyWorkForYou  Originally built almost entirely by a dozen volunteers,  TheyWorkForYou  [8] is mySociety’s most visited site (attracting more than two million users in 2007 alone). TheyWorkForYou provides citizens with a range of information on their politicians, such as: who their local MP is; what MPs said in Parliament; summaries of how MPs have voted; text of debates in Parliament; videos of MPs talking in debates; written questions MPs have submitted to government departments, and the answers they have got back; email alerts whenever an MP speaks, or a topic is mentioned in Parliament; comments and annotations from users on what has been said, and more.  In July 2009, mySociety reported that the coverages of TheyWorkForYou has been extended to include the House of Commons debates starting from the 1935 general election and general information on MPs is available from the beginning of the 19th century.[9]  Along with the UK Parliament, the TheyWorkForYou project also covers the Scottish Parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the Welsh Assembly. Similar projects at various times operated in:New Zealand:  www.theyworkforyou.co.nzUnited States: www.opencongress.org  Australia: www.openaustralia.com  Ireland: www.kidarestreet.com.In advance of the 2005 general election, the British Channel 4 used a branded version of TheyWorkForYou to supply their MP data.[10] The site won the Community and Innovation award in the 2005 New Statesman New Media Awards, with the judges saying that they ""were unanimous in feeling that TheyWorkForYou was the nomination that has done most to contribute to civic society in the UK.""[11] In the House of Lords, in a debate on the Power Inquiry, Lord Gould of Brookwood referred to TheyWorkForYou and the other mySociety sites as ""probably the biggest single catalyst for political change in this country"".[12] In 2008, The Daily Telegraph rated it 41st in a list of the 101 most useful websites.[13]  FixMyStreet  As an online service, FixMyStreet [14] allows users to easily report broken infrastructure in their area to the local authority; and to start, or take part in public discussions about maintaining and improving the infrastructure and environment in their neighbourhoods. The reports are posted on the website using a web-based  mapping  tool and then transferred by mySociety to the appropriate local councils, who are supposed to take care of the repairs.  According to mySociety, the aim of FixMyStreet is “to transform the act of reporting faults – turning it from a private one-to-one process into a public experience where anyone can see what has been reported. [They] also aim to lower barriers to communication between local government and communities and to build a sense of engagement and inclusion in the process of maintaining and improving the public infrastructure and environment in neighbourhoods.” [15]  Aside from posting new reports, the website allows users to view old reports and local alerts for each geographic area, follow the state of reports, and monitor the work of local representatives. The website also allows officials to leave comments and updates with regards to the reported problem and encourages local residents to discuss the problem and update others.  FixMyStreet can also be a tool for a better community organization. For instance, a community in Great Yarmouth joined forces through FixMyStreet to clear their local unused railway track.[16] The website made possible a dialogue between community members and the council’s community development worker.  As of October 4, 2009, the FixMyStreet declared that it received 730 new reports in the past week, 1,044 reports were fixed in the last month, and 55,171 updates were posted on reports. The state of all reports can be viewed on the website.[17]  The website has been developed by mySociety and the Young Foundation, with funding from the Department of Constitutional Affairs Innovations Fund. In December 2008, mySociety introduced an iPhone app for FixMyStreet, available to download from the App Store.[18]  Projects based on the model of FixMyStreet currently operate in the Netherlands ( http://www.verbeterdebuurt.nl ), New Zealand (http://www.fixmystreet.org.nz) and Canada ( http://www.fixmystreet.ca/ ).  No. 10 Petitions Website  Launched following a request by the Prime Minister's office in 2006, the No 10 Petitions website [19] was the largest British non-partisan democracy site by volume of users as of 2011, with over 8 million signatures from over 5 million unique email addresses, representing around 10% of the UK population. At its peak, nearly 200,000 people signed up to the service in a single day, and 20,000 within a single hour.[20]  To sign a  petition , a user had to provide their name, address, and a verifiable email. The creator of a petition could decide for how long they wanted to keep it open (the longest period being 12 months). One could add their signature to an existing petition by providing the same details (name, address, and email). Once a petition was closed, usually provided there were 500 signatures or more, it was passed to officials who work for the Prime Minister in Downing Street, or sent to the relevant Government department for a response. Every person who signed one received an email detailing the Government's response to the issues raised.[21] Government responses to popular petitions are the rule rather than the exception to it, and petitions with as few as 101 signatures have received official responses.  As of October 2009, there were over 4,600 open  petitions , and almost 35,000 petitions created since the creation of the website. According to mySociety,  “for legal and anti-spam reasons this site cannot host every petition submitted, but the rule is to accept everything that meets the terms and conditions of use. No petition will be rejected unless it violates these terms. And even when petitions cannot be hosted No.10 will still publish as much of rejected petitions as is consistent with legal and anti-spam requirements, including the reason why it could not be hosted.”[22]  The largest petition to date garnered over 1.8 million signatures and asked for the intervention of a planned vehicle tracking and road pricing scheme. It met a 1200 word response from Prime Minister Tony Blair which both acknowledged the petition's argument and defended the government's position.[23]  WhatDoTheyKnow  Launched in 2008, WhatDoTheyKnow[24] allows users to send out requests for information to different government departments and agencies. A user may pick a department, type a request, and mySociety forwards it to the appropriate governmental officials. All the requests are proceeded according to the British Freedom of Information Act, 2000 (FOI). The website also contains an archive of requests and responses made by other people, and it is possible to set up email or RSS alerts to get notified about interesting developments.  According to governmental statistics released in October 2009,  ""13.1% of all FOI requests to “Departments of State” in the second quarter of 2009 were made via WhatDoTheyKnow.com (up from 8.5% in the first quarter of 2009). In absolute terms, this was 753 out of 5769 requests.  32.3% of FOI requests to the Home Office (which includes the UKBA and the IPS) were made via WhatDoTheyKnow in the second quarter of 2009. In absolute terms, this was 206 out of 638 requests.  The [2011] figures also show that in twelve of the UK’s twenty-one Departments of State more than 10% of FOI requests were made via WhatDoTheyKnow.""[25]  WriteToThem  Launched in 2005, WriteToThem[26] allows users to send messages to any politician in the UK and publishes league tables of MP responsiveness every year.  In 2008, WriteToThem sent a total of 183,493 messages to elected representatives. The average response rate (within 2 or 3 weeks) was 59%, with 52% of the users writing for the first time to a politician of any kind.[27] Since its creation, the website helped users send more than 450,000 messages.Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

The Institute on the Common Good's mission is to serve ""the community at-large by promoting the common good and providing a safe and effective space for community dialogue, communal discernment, and public deliberation"" using the tools of ""Dialogue. Discernment. Democratic Deliberation."" [1]  The Institute on the Common Good seeks to build strong communities, create dialogue within communities in order to foster improved community relationships and build trust, and to provide a safe and engaging environment for deliberative discussions. Additionally, The Institute on the Common Good sponsors various events such as workshops, panel discussions,speaking engagements, and forums. The Institute on the Common Good is heavily influenced by Jesuit philosophy as well as the Catholic social ethos.  Contents1 MIssion and Purpose1.1 Philosophy2 History3 Major Projects and Events3.1 Public Deliberation Initiative3.2 The Homelessness Dialogue Project3.3 Notable Speakers4 Publications5  References6  External LinksMIssion and Purpose  The Institute on the Common Good's mission is to ""to help individuals and groups engage one another more effectively as they seek to forge their common destiny."" [1]  The primary means by which they endeavor to achieve this goal is through community dialogue and deliberation. The ICG also sponsors several speaking engagements, forums, and events aimed at fostering dialogue and encouraging deliberation in order to improve the common good.Philosophy  The philosophy of The Institute on the Common Good finds its roots in the teachings of St. Ignatius of Loyola, particularly his three core values: finding God in all things, good intentions, and the will to be changed or transformed by others. Additionally, the ICG's philosophy is further informed by the four key concepts derived from the tradition of Catholic social teaching. These are:Human Dignity: The inherent belief in the dignity of the human person.  Common Good and Community: The human person is both sacred and social, growing and achieving fulfillment only in community.  Subsidiarity and Participation: Individuals have a right to fully participate in decisions made on issues relevant to them, and giving a voice to the most vulnerable members of society is a key moral duty.  Rights and Responsibilities: Society can only function if the fullest level of human rights are recognized and members recognize their rights and well as their responsibilities to their own welfare and the welfare of others. [1]The Institute on the Common Good endeavors to merge these philosophical tenets with ""the latest research in the emerging field of dialogue."" [1]History  The Institute on the Common Good was founded in 1998 by Regis University President Father Michael J. Sheeran, S.J.. Father Sheeran had long sought to create a community outreach arm of the University and thus founded the Institute ""based on his conviction that important issues can be resolved and societal changes can occur if people gather together and speak honestly with one another."" [1]Father Sheeran's interest in dialogue and deliberation originated from his participation in a dialogue between the New York president of the NAACP and several local business and labor leaders at the height of the civil rights movement, in the New York office of the Jesuit magazine America, for which Sheeran worked. Although these groups mistrusted one another, they were able to ""create a set of priorities that helped convince Civil Rights leaders that New York business and labor leaders were committed to working together,"" preventing a potentially violent dispute from erupting. [1]In 1993, Father Sheeran hosted the first meeting between President Bill Clinton and Pope John Paul II. Despite their differences on a whole host of issues, the meeting resulted in an agreement to cooperate on sending aid to Muslim countries, and a promise by the Pope to use his influence to encourage peace in Yugoslavia.  It was from these two historic experience on the power of dialogue that Father Sheeran gained the impetus to create The Institute on the Common Good.  Father Richard Dunphy, S.J. was named the Institute’s first director in 1998 and served until 2001. The directorship was then handed over to Dr. Paul Alexander, who is also the director of the Master of Nonprofit Management Master’s degree at Regis University, and serves as director to the present day.Major Projects and Events  The Institute on the Common Good's primary purpose is to provide speaking engagements, forums, and community outreach through the numerous events and initiatives it sponsors each year. Rather than merely researching dialogue and deliberative techniques as an academic exercise the Institute on the Common Good ""is unique in that it actively partners with groups engaged in community life. These projects take many forms and include public and private dialogues, initiatives, educational programs, speakers, and collaboration and partnerships with a large variety of civic and social organizations."" [1]  Some notable examples include:Public Deliberation Initiative  In the Spring of 2006, The Institute on the Common Good formed a partnership with the Council of Public Policy Education to create the Public Deliberation Initiative. The purpose of this initiative is to ""offer workshops, forums and other activities based on a the National Issues Forums approach to discussing critical community and national issues."" [1]  Additionally, the Public Deliberation Initiative is aimed at NIF moderator training and working with state, national, and international organizations to create and foster deliberative forums based on the NIF model.The Homelessness Dialogue Project  In September of 2006 The Institute on the Common Good partnered with the Center for Civic Ethics at Denver University and the Capitol Hill United Neighborhoods to create the Homeless Dialogue Project. The purpose of this project was to bring the homed and the homeless together as neighbors to discuss the serious issues surrounding homelessness, and to create a forum through which deliberation about alternative policy options could take place.Notable Speakers  In addition to sponsoring forums and initiatives, the Institute on the Common Good seeks to provide the student body of Regis University and the Denver community at large with a diverse range of world-renowned speakers as a fresh avenue of education, and as a means of creating dialogue about important national and international issues. The Institute on the Common Good has made it a tradition to invite Nobel Peace Prize Winners to speak, and, altogether, 13 Nobel laureates have spoken at Regis since 1996. Examples of such speakers include:President Lech Walesa, leader of the Polish Solidarity movement,  Gail Collins, New York Times Columnist,  Betty Williams of Northern Ireland, Nobel Peace Prize Winner,  David Trimble of Northern Ireland, Nobel Peace Prize Winner,  His Holiness, The Dalai Lama of Tibet,  Nobel Peace Laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa,  President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica,  Robert Bellah a Professor of Sociology at the University of California-Berkley,  Elizabeth Dole, former President of the American Red Cross and former US Senator,  Sister Helen Prejean, Author of Dead Man Walking,  Elie Wiesel, Holocaust survivor and author. [1]Publications  The Institute on the Common Good publishes a biannual electronic newsletter which can be found in PDF format in their  newsletter archive.  The newsletter details upcoming events, information about current and past initiatives, tips for effective dialogue, guest columns, and musings from the Director.References↑  1.01.11.21.31.41.51.61.71.8The ICG WebsiteExternal LinksICG Facebook GroupICG YouTube ChannelICG's Ning Social Network",2,0,0,0,0,

Izwe was founded in 2009 by Richard Wilson and Nick Nielson who are leaders in participation and empowerment work. The Izwe group have worked with OECD, Ministre de Budget (France), Californian State Department, Danish Government, States of Jersey, Every UK Government Department and Local and Regional Government across Europe. ""Izwe"" is a word meaning ""People Power"", ""Voice"", or ""Land"" in a variety of African languages.Work  Izwe work with their clients to facilitate better participatory communication and research, by providing both online and offline suppport and tools, as well a high level of expertise in both these areas. As well as a wealth of experience in participation, empowerment and social research, the team also includes ICT experts such as Benoît Thieulin - who advised on the presidential campaigns of both Ségolène Royal and Barrack Obama; and Paul Birch the founder of  Bebo.com .Izwe.com  is an online social networking platform which can be developed to provide organisations with individualised ways of communicating both externally and internally (i.e. with their staff, their customers and/or the communities that they serve) as well as promote efficiency and innovation. The  Izwe.com  platform helps to organisations to meet requirements such as the  Duty to Involve  as well as providing data and developing community empowerment. Expert support and advice on e-participation methods is integrated with consultation on participatory events, research and processes that use more traditional forms of communication.Programmes  The ""Leadership 2009"" programme, endorsed by  NESTA , worked with a range of UK public bodies to develop communication strategies - including social networking - and was aimed at targeting the ""hard to reach"" in communities. New programmes include ""Connecting London"", which is aimed at improving the ways in which borough councils communicate with the public, and ""Health 2010"", which will provide Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) with social networking and data gathering tools through  Izwe.com . Izwe are aso working on a programme called ""Government Introperability"" which is intended to raise the standards of the use of online tools in the international governmental sector.  Izwe's programmes have also been used to inform the Empowerment Delivery work of the Department of Communities &amp; Local Government (CLG) and NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement.Funding  Izwe is a social entreprise and is funded through charging for its services as well as additional funding for the specific programme ""Connecting London"" from Capital Ambition, London Civic Forum and the Department for Communities and Local Government.  At least 15% of Izwe's profits go to the Izwe foundation, whose beneficiaries are decided in tandem with Izwe's clients and partners. ",0,0,0,0,0,

We are comprised of a network of researchers and practitioners working in research institutions and civil society organisations in seven countries – Angola, Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Nigeria, South Africa and the UK.  The aim of the Citizenship DRC is to increase understanding of how to support the efforts of poor and marginalised groups to define and claim their rights. Our seven principal research themes include:  1. Deepinging Democracy in States and Localities  2. Local-global Citizen Engagement  3. Violence, Citizenship and Participation  4. Spaces for Change? The Politics of Participation in New Democratic Arenas  5. Realising Rights and Claiming Accountabilities  6. Meanings and Expressions of Rights and Citizenship  7. Science and Citizens in a Global ContextPartners  In order to gain a critical understanding of citizenship, participation and accountability in different contexts, the Citizenship DRC works collaboratively through a network of partners from research institutions and civil society organisations in seven countries. Our seven partners include:  Acção Para O Desenvolvimento Rural E Ambiental (ADRA) – Angola  BRAC Development Institute (BDI) – Bangladesh  Centro Brasileiro de Análise e Planejamento (CEBRAP) – Brazil  Society for Participatory Research in Asia (PRIA) – India  Theatre for Development Centre of Ahmadu Bello University (TFDC) – Nigeria  African Centre for Citizenship and Democracy / School of Government of the University of the Western Cape (ACCEDE-UWC) – South Africa  Institute of Development Studies (IDS) – UK  In addition to the seven core partners, Citizenship DRC has collaborated on various research projects and publications with a number of research associates from an additional 13 countries.Activities  The Citizenship DRC brings together institutional partners to produce and communicate knowledge on the relationship between citizens and their states. It is hoped that this, in turn, will contribute to poverty reduction in partner countries by empowering citizens and by helping state institutions become more capable, accountable and responsive. To meet this goal, the Citizenship DRC carries out three broad activities:  Research: Since 2001, the Citizenship DRC has produced more than 400 research outputs that examine the effect of citizen action on states and societies. Our research now constitutes ten years’ worth of work that challenges top-down approaches to development that have traditionally neglected local realities. These outputs include journal articles, a nine-volume series with Zed Books entitled ‘Claiming Citizenship’, working papers and videos, among others. Many of these outputs are available online and all are currently being collected for the production of a DVD-ROM that encapsulates the programme’s entire research and policy work.  Capacity building: Building research capacity within the Citizenship DRC has been embedded in the consortium’s ways of working since 2001. The decentralisation of research coordination efforts has contributed to a shared sense of ownership amongst partners. Research partners come together annually in research meetings and workshops to share their research experiences and findings. This has facilitated innovations in new methodologies and the development of new analytical frameworks. In addition to building research capacities, the Citizenship DRC has also developed its network to include projects on teaching and learning citizenship; sustaining and increasing research funding; and communicating research findings to wider audiences.  Communication and policy influencing: Through its integrated approach to research and communication, the Citizenship DRC has designed a range of strategies for working with local and international stakeholders. Using a variety of policy mapping techniques, we have increased our capacity to effectively use varied communication mediums to inform relevant policy debates. Most recently, our partners’ research has informed the redesign of the indigenous health service in Brazil and been used in high-level discussions in the presidential commission for electoral reform in Nigeria, among others.Funding  The Citizenship DRC receives principal funding from the UK Department for International Development.Sample of Key Publications  Cornwall, A and V Schattan P Coelho (eds) (2007) Spaces for Change?

210,organization,Metagovernment,https://participedia.net/organization/210,Description not available.,0,2010-02-07,2022-07-17,56,"""Ed Pastore""",https://participedia.net/user/56,421204,"""Nina Sartor""",https://participedia.net/user/421204,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Mission and Purpose  The mission of the  Metagovernment project  is to support the development and use of Internet tools which enable the members of any community to fully participate in the governance of that community. It is a global group of people working on various projects which further this goal.  Metagovernment's political purpose stems from the political philosophy of open source government which pushes for the combination of traditional democratic principles and Internet-based collective involvement to enable citizens to participate in the creation of policy.  This collaborative governance system does not directly relate to traditional direct democracy. It is not based on majority rule. Rather, it relies on consensus decision on all issues affecting the community. Failure to participate implies consent in decisions made. In this sense, it reflects  Robert A. Dahl's principles of democracy , in that ideally a system of meta-government encourages:Decentralization: A centralized entity has less control and it is the participants as a collective making decisions  Encouraging Diversity of Thought: Since consensus is the goal, all opinions must be heard  Centralization of Information: To ensure that everyone can participate, all information is found a single location with easy access  Equality of Opportunity: Everyone has the same ability to participate (questionable, given that it is an online system)  Participants are equal  All actions are transparent for everyone to seeMany of the member projects of the Metagovernment are working toward building software which can act as a stand-alone governance mechanism; i.e., without relying on individual empowered leaders to make decisions. To that end, the project itself eschews a formal leadership structure. At the moment, it operates as an adhocracy (modeled after the typical open source software project), though it is working on using the software of member projects to act as its governance mechanism.  The intention of the project is to build governance software which is to be adopted first in small communities. From there, they intend to study the implementation, collect feedback, and adapt the software such that it can spread outward with the potential to gradually replace many institutions of representative democracy with a new kind of social organization called  Collaborative Governance .History  While there is little information available on the origins of the Metagovernment project--even on its own website--open source governance first appeared in the early 1980s as part of a computer-based research project on  online deliberation  and  deliberative democracy .  Other small examples of open source government and ICT-facilitated collaborative democratic mechanisms appeared in the early 21st Century as Internet technology drastically improved and usage boomed. ICT-facilitated collaborative governance is a young, emerging form of governance being developed to adapt the traditional aims of direct democracy with the new capabilities presented by the internet. Practical development of this governance method is being undertaken by the  Metagovernment  project.  Traditional implementations of direct participation have labored under enormous obstacles. First there are the technical obstacles of gathering all people together for each vote, then of meaningfully tallying so many votes. The existence of the internet and software remove these obstacles.  However, that still leaves the much more profound criticisms of direct democracy: mob rule, demagoguery, issue overload, and tyranny of the majority. The Metagovernment project posits that, by careful application of sophisticated software, these issues can be used to solve each other. Simply put, mob rule and demagoguery result from focusing governance on a few hot-button issues. Issue overload is only a problem because of the demands of a majority rule system, requiring that there be massive participation on each of these few hot-button decisions. By contrast, ICT-facilitated collaborative governance opens up every decision to everyone. Nobody is expected to participate in each decision, but those who do must come to a consensus or no action is taken.  Many first attempts at ICT-facilitated collaborative governance were an effort to create a citizens' forum for elections and public opinion. The  Green Party of Canada , for example, created what it referred to as a ""living platform"" to compile the opinions of Canadian citizens and policy experts to ensure a very well-represented platform for the entire party.Specializations and Activities  As the organization is still in its early years, the activities currently primarily focus on growing the information present on the website as well as its influence. According to the Metagovernment project website, there are a number of manners in which the average global citizen can participate in the community:Join the Startup Committee  Organized as an  adhocracy  style mechanism, the Metagovernment project needs people to join their list serve to become well-informed on the goings-on of the organization. This allows people to become active members.Attend Meetings  Metagovernment project holds  online meetings  that are open to anyone who wishes to participate and help the organization grow. Ideally these meetings will occur on a biweekly basis, but as of now the time between each ranges from months to even an entire yearPropose and Participate in Votings  Using software from the member projects, such as  Vilfredo goes to Athens  for open questions, discussion and voting are set up for members to propose their own ideas and vote on others'.Edit the website/wiki  Similar to  participedia , collaborate democracy's future depends on participation and the growth of their web presence. Interested individuals are welcome to register on their wiki/website and make edits to any page. The more articles that appear, the more information there is regarding metagovernment project and the political philosophy.Contribute Code  One key component of the metagovernment project is the success and growth of its  member projects . Active members can help contribute to these projects, improving the software and making voting and proposals easier.Translate the Wiki  Effective democracy implies equal access to participation. The primary language for the metagovernment is English, but this limits who is able to participate in deliberation. The goal is to translate at least the main page into other languages for information on the organization to be viewable by man. Currently it is available in English, German, Spanish and Japanese.Promote the Organization Online  With the popularity of online social networking, the organization wants participants to promote the wiki through direct links on various websites, bookmarks on websites such as  StumbleUpon , blog/forum posts about the political philosophy or direct e-mail invitations to other organizations.Pass out Literature  The metagovernment project website has a  link to download promotional literature  for its participating members to pass out to passerby or post on community bulletin boards.Attend Conferences  Active members are encouraged to attend conferences about governance and technology to promote the general goals of collaborative governance, and speak at the events if possible.Major Projects and Events  In addition to individuals interested in the general notion and promotion of collaborative governance, there are several software development projects involved in the Metagovernment project. At this time, all but one of these are free and open source software. The member projects range from software tools intended to build consensus and facilitate decision-making, to ones which are intended to act as stand-alone governance mechanisms. As of February 2010, most of the projects are, roughly, in a beta stage of development, and have not been deployed substantially. However, the Metagovernment project itself has used several of the participating software tools to make decisions internal to the community.  The member projects are active and created by members of the metagovernment project for the members' benefit and to advance the capabilities of collaborative democracy.AdhocracyAdhocracy is a drafting and delegated voting tool for small and medium-sized groups. It is one of the active projects of the Metagoverment project. It is a free and open source software project following a standard three-section BSD-style license. It uses a liquid democracy software website, and in Adhocracy, individuals choose to act as NGOs, initiatives or corporations to network through democratic principles and processes to formulate goals, strategies and internal rules to develop positions on issues. It is a practical implementation of direct parliamentary systems.CandiwiCandiwi (formerly Metascore) is the name of the software which can administer any community wishing to govern itself through collaborative governance and is currently in the alpha development stage. It uses a scoring system to evaluate resolutions.DemocracyLabDemocracyLab is an experiment in direct democracy, powered by open source software, and built on the idea that technology can empower individuals to harness freedom of speech and the power of the vote to solve today’s most challenging problems.  It uses participants’ posts and votes to build a dynamic map of political thought designed to facilitate consensus and solve problems. The result is an engaging public forum where the best thinking rises to the top, creating a community-driven alternative to traditional politics.  DemocracyLab is a transparent and collaborative work in progress.Dynamic DemocracyDynamic Democracy is a ranking engine for users to submit and vote on ""bills"" that they wish the government was considering. The organization neither vet submissions nor actually campaigns on them. Instead it allows anyone post freely and anonymously to see what information and ideas arise.  The site came about in the wake of the  Digital Economy Bill  fiasco in the UK - when it became clear that the government really doesn't address the public's issues very well. The organizers wanted to see what the government would be talking about if the citizens were the government. In that way, it is an online program similar to the  Countywide Community Forums (of King County) .EudemocraciaEudemocracia is an Argentinian NGO. It has the same overall mission as Metagovernment (online collaborative government), but it makes its primary focus activism rather than just pure deliberation.Indaba Application NetworkThe Indaba Application Network is the platform running 'WeVote' (on Facebook) and 'ChoiceRanker'NationBuilderNationBuilder is a member project of the Metagovernment project. It is the foundation of  White House 2 , which is a web platform for American citizens to (unofficially) collectively act as the White House decision-makers. There is a similar program available in  Canada ,  Iceland  and  AustraliaOpenpoliticsOpenpolitics is a Canadian issues based approach to public deliberation that developed as a result of the living platform project (Green Party of Canada). Activity is on hiatus as owner/founder Michael Pilling focuses on personal goals, but supporters are hopeful that the group can provide a ""bigger solution"" which draws input from multiple organizations and websites.Telematics Freedom FoundationThe Telematics Freedom Foundation has the general goal of furthering democracy, including media and global democracy, through the promotion of telematic solutions that enable the protection and extention of the communication and participation rights of all people.Vilfredo goes to AthensThe Vilfredo Goes To Athens project starts from the research of what would happen from a mathematical point of view if the principle ""without consensus there is no law"" were in fact truth and seriously considered. It also assumes that in many case there is a possible solution out there that would generate the consensus. Sometimes key individuals (often regarded as leaders) would find this solution by speaking with the various parts. This program software is trying to help the discussant by showing where the key differences are. It seeks to help people find their own solutions without the need of a deified leader, as such leaders eventually can become a burden themselves.Virtual ParliamentThe Virtual Parliament is a UK based website that allows the public to vote on existing policies from political parties, and also suggest their own.VotorolaVotorola is a member project of the Metagovernment project. It is a software designed for building consensus and reaching decisions in public. Installed in a local town or region, nationwide or worldwide, it functions as a primary rule-making system for the open proposal, refinement and selection of candidate laws, plans and policies. It also functions as a primary electoral system, one in which candidates are chosen by open, cross-party consensus. The backbone of the system is a peer-to-peer voting mechanism that allows for recursive delegation, unrestricted nomination, and continuous vote shifting. The voter lists are authenticated by a neighbourhood trust network.VotetocracyVotetocracy is a site which allows citizens to vote on bills before the United States Congress and send votes to their representatives. Citizen's votes are tallied against the votes of Congress and displayed as agreements or disagreements. It acts essentially as a rating system for Congressional members and a path to a different kind of governance. In addition to the above, version 2 will allow organizations, lobby groups, and others rally their members and Votetocracy members. The project is building an internet-wide platform that organizations can embed in their own sites to tap into the Votetocracy system. The ultimate goal is to combine the collective efforts of citizens and organizations into one voice with measurable outcomes and comparisons versus the decisions made in Congress.Funding  A direct budget number for the metagovernment project was not found, however, they explicitly state their political/philosophical stance on funding on their website: ""In collaborative governance systems, proposals should be self-funding. If a tax or other fund-raising measure is needed to implement a proposal, it should be accounted for in the language of the proposal, and not forbidden by a higher level of government. Perhaps there can be a minimalist central funding authority in each community to administer the accounting of the money, but the actual funding mechanism should be part of the proposal. There should always be a fundamental bias against giving power to central funding authorities, and all such authorities should exist at the whim of their associated community website.""  [1]Analysis  In an online forum discussing the future of the metagovernment project using  Gname Loom , some of the participants appear optimistic about this umbrella organization and its member projects, but there is also tremendous criticism of its effectiveness in achieving the goals outlined in the Metagovernment project's  Mission and Vision page . One participant, Patrick Anderson, voiced a concern that because there is no opt-out mechanism, metagovernment's goal of consensus building--with regards to funding--means that: With traditional taxation, I am 'required' to help pay for that construction unless I can get a majority of others to complain that it is not needed because I already paid taxes into an untargeted ""slush fund"". I cannot opt-out unless I group with others to opt-out. If I 'win' by stopping construction, it causes others to 'lose' because they DID want to fund the project.  [2]  A system of metagovernment relates back to general criticisms of direct democracy that have been around for thousands of years, primarily the notion of mob rule or  mobocracy , only furthered by the aforementioned instance of opt-out vs. opt-in funding.  Plato in The Republic wrote that, ""Democracy, which is a charming form of government, full of variety and disorder, and dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequaled alike.""  [3]  Democracy appears to be a short-term system full of disorder and instability. Consensus building takes time during which solutions could have been implemented by a unilateral decision and corruption is possible with vote buying. Just as non-participation implies consent in metagovernment, consensus building implies compromise and the potential for minority opinions to be coerced into accepting the majority rule.

The 50 organizations that had formed the Coalition for a National Conference on Dialogue &amp; Deliberation decided to continue working together, becoming the founding members of the National Coalition for Dialogue &amp; Deliberation (NCDD).[4]  Between the 2002 and 2004 conferences, a recognizable “dialogue and deliberation community” began to develop. Sharing resources, news, and opportunities became a hallmark of the Coalition’s work and NCDD continues to address disconnects in between practitioners, scholars, and participants in dialogue &amp; deliberation by providing a variety of activities, collaborative projects, and resources to its members and others the field.[5]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  NCDD’s Founding Director is Sandy Heierbacher, Courtney Breese is Managing Director, Joy Garman is Office Manager, and Keiva Hummel is the Communications Coordinator.  NCDD is made up of over 700 members encompassing a broad range of practitioners, organizations, researchers, public administrators, activists and students involved in the field of dialogue, deliberation, and collaborative action.[6]  Funding for NCDD is provided through membership dues and by sponsoring organizations. Organizational memberships are $200-$350/year and individuals can become Members for $75/year or $7.50/month. Student Memberships are also available for $30/year. Sponsorship starts at $1,000 and helps support NCDD’s network and operations.[7]  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The National Coalition for Dialogue &amp; Deliberation supports the work of D&amp;D practitioners: those who “bring people together across divides to discuss, decide, and take action together effectively on today’s toughest issues.”[8] The Coalition providing its members with opportunities to gather and exchange knowledge, resources and teaching guides, news about new developments in the field, and a variety of recurring events.  Its National Conferences are highly participatory, involving plenary sessions as a way to showcase innovative large-group dialogue and deliberation techniques – often blending methods to better meet the group’s needs - and to utilize the wisdom in the room to tackle challenges facing this emerging field. Concurrent  workshops , led by key leaders and innovators in the field, allow participants to build skills, increase knowledge, broaden awareness, and build relationships. Arts and culture also play a prominent role in each conference.[9]  NCDD’s resource section of its website is publicly-accessible, offering information on everything from teaching manuals to case studies and program evaluations.[10] Its popular Engagement Streams framework helps community leaders, public officials, and others decide when best to use different engagement processes, based on their goals and means.[11]  Major Projects and Events  Confab Calls  NCDD’s “Confab calls” give members the opportunity to connect with each other, hear about exciting projects in dialogue &amp; deliberation, and explore the field’s most pressing challenges. Audio recordings, video recordings, and archives of the collaborative documents created by participants are all made available to members. Examples of past Confab Calls include:A discussion between engagement practitioners &amp; journalists on partnering to help bring people together across differences  Michelle Vilchez and Malissa Netane-Jones shared their experience working with communities and law enforcement at the Peninsula Conflict Resolution Center  Linda Ellinor and Paul Cienfuegos of Community Rights US talked about the community rights movement and its impact on dialogue and deliberation efforts at a local level  Senator John Unger discussed how community engagement during his campaign lead to his re-election[12]Tech Tuesday Learning Events  NCDD’s semi-monthly Tech Tuesday series invites leaders in the field of online technology to share their innovations and ways to use online tools to support engagement work. Past speakers have included Ethelo, Konveio, Citizens Foundation, and the Urban Interactive Studio.[13]  National Conferences  NCDD has held National Conferences on Dialogue &amp; Deliberation every two years since 2002. NCDD's national conferences place special emphasis on the goal of strengthening and uniting the rapidly-growing dialogue and deliberation community.[14] The Conferences have been held in different cities in the United States and have attracted over 3000 participants from over 20 countries.[15]  Other Projects and Engagements  NCDD has also come to play a strong facilitative leadership role in the emerging field of dialogue and deliberation by collaborating with its members on a variety of projects and programs. Examples include:Public Engagement Principles (PEP) Project: beginning in February 2009, NCDD initiated and co-led (with the International Association for Public Participation and the Co-Intelligence Institute) a collaborative project to create a set mutually-agreed upon Core Principles for Public Engagement[16]  Upgrading the Way We Do Politics: developed in the fall of 2009 in response to the controversial health care town halls held during the August congressional resource, NCDD members worked together to quickly create a series of articles and a one-page flyer to help public officials hold more productive public meetings[17]  Regional Conferences: in fall 2010, NCDD held 5 regional conferences instead of one national event. Over 700 people attended the events in Austin, Boston, Denver, Cupertino (Bay Area), and Portland[18]  Presentation on Audience Polling Systems 2015: co-hosted with the IAP2 Northern California Chapter in San Francisco the two-hour event included networking and a presentation from NCDD Supporting member David Campt titled “Paradigm Shift: How Facilitators Are Accelerating Their Practice Through Recent Developments on Audience Polling Systems.”[19]  Innovations in Participatory Democracy Conference 2018: hosted by NCDD member organizations the Participatory Budgeting Project and the Jefferson Center, as well as, the Center for the Future of Arizona, the Katal Center, the Participatory Governance Initiative at Arizona State University, Phoenix Union High School District, and the Policy Jury Group, the three-day conference hosted a wide range of innovators in community engagement and participatory democracy.[20]Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

Reinventing Public ConsultationMASS is best known for its innovative approach to public engagement and consultation. First, they believe that public consultation is a form of cultural production. As such, success depends on the design choices their clients make when they create opportunities for members of the public to interact with and advise government. Since 2007, they have conducted twenty-five major reference panels, citizens’ assemblies and commissions for government, tackling some of the toughest and most divisive issues in public policy today. They also routinely host national, provincial and regional conversations, inviting Canadians to think about their country's future and their priorities for investment and reform.Creating Publics : Introducing the  Civic LotteryWorking with Canada Post, MASS mails tens of thousands of Canadian households each year inviting residents to volunteer to serve on one of several reference panels or commissions. Civic Lotteries produce random-representative cohorts that contain a wide range of perspectives and can speak for their communities. MASS is a global leader in the use of  sortition  to engage citizens in democratic processes.Convening Publics : Introducing the Reference Panel  Reference Panels are typically comprised of thirty-six randomly-selected residents who meet over several days to advise government on a specific policy issue. With an explicit mandate, these panels provide a deliberative forum in each to learn about a complex issue from leading experts and with the assistance of trained facilitators, find common ground. MASS has pioneered the design and use of Reference Panels to inform public policy choices in Canada.2. Developing Ambitious Strategies That Enjoy Public SupportStrategy isn't only about getting from A to B. When it comes to aligning divergent priorities, or getting clear about an organization's core values, there are no straight lines. This is especially true for public sector organizations which work to juggle changing political contexts, fiscal constraints, and the competing interests of stakeholders and communities. MASS LBP works with clients to develop strategies for organizations that they perceive to be serious about change. They approach strategy as a collaborative process that helps to establish priorities and new goals, with the aim of helping clients to raise their sights, strengthen their relationships, and reach agreement from first principles. Currently, their Strategy Practice works in two fields: first, to develop multi-year strategic plans and secondly, to develop engagement strategies that assist organizations to better integrate effective engagement techniques within existing governance and communications frameworks.3. Delivering Solid Research That Shapes Good ChoicesMASS provides policy-related research services to clients across many sectors. They routinely conduct wide-ranging environmental scans, prepare case studies and provocation papers, interview experts and stakeholders, commission essays from thought-leaders and host workshops to review findings or carry a discussion forward. MASS claims to provide insight, creativity and breadth, and to provide clear evidence and strong examples they can use to make their case. Using their knowledge of different policy areas and the state-of-play in different jurisdictions, they help clients to map out what's possible.Origins and DevelopmentInspired by Canada's first  Citizens' Assemblies , MASS LBP was founded in 2007 by Peter MacLeod and George Gosbee to extend this model and reinvent public consultation.  To date, MASS has conducted twenty-five major  reference panels , citizens assemblies and commissions for government involving more than 1000 Canadians, and reaching 250,000 households. Cumulatively, this represents some 30,000 hours of  deliberation  on significant public issues, making MASS an internationally-recognized leader in the design and delivery of deliberative processes for government. In addition, they provide a range of services to public sector organizations including strategic planning and communications, custom research, facilitation and hosting, as well as event coordination and logistics.Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingMASS LBP is a highly collaborative organization that they believe works better and smarter when they are transparent and honest about funding; they value the conducting of business in full public view. There are only two salary levels at MASS. They often work on projects often funded with public monies and so, they believe clients and citizen-participants deserve to know what they earn. Currently, senior staff with one year of service earn $80,000 per year. Junior staff earn $60,000. Part-time staff earn either of the two rates on a pro-rata basis. MASS is also proud to be a  Wagemark -Certified company.Specializations, Methods and ToolsTheir services include:Comprehensive process design and delivery – from 20 to 200+ participants  Strategic advice concerning effective engagement  Corporate and public needs assessment  Program evaluation and analysis  Custom research and dissemination  Facilitation teams  Public communications and curriculum development  Event coordination and logisticsMASS LBP's principal methods are:Citizens' AssemblyCitizens' Reference PanelsCivic LotteryMajor Projects and EventsProjects include:BC Services Card User Panel on Digital ServicesCalgary Commission on Municipal InfrastructureCitizens' Reference Panel on Health Technologies (Ontario)Halton Region Citizens’ Reference Panel on Strategic Priorities (2011)Halton Region Citizens’ Reference Panel on Strategic Priorities (2015)Metrolinx Regional Residents’ Reference Panel on Transportation InvestmentMetrolinx Residents’ Reference Panel on the Davenport Community Rail OverpassMississauga-Halton Citizens' Reference Panel Integrated Health Services PlanNorthumberland Hills Hospital’s Collaborative Budget Strategy (Cobourg, Ontario, Canada)Ontario Ministry of Consumer Services Reference Panel on the Condominium ActOttawa Hospital Patients' Reference Panel on Clinical Services TransformationResidents’ Reference Panel on Supervised Injection ServicesSouth East Ontario Citizens' Reference Panel Integrated Health Services PlanThe Citizens’ Reference Panel on the Mental Health Action Plan for CanadaToronto Planning Review PanelAnalysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

Among the discussed topics, Urban Reform appeared as an important issue, present in the agenda of great part of the social movements.  The idea of founding CIDADE appeared in 1987. The occupation of housing blocks and the demands for basic sanitation and public transportation led Porto Alegre’s popular movements to seek support from technicians involved with their struggles.  At this moment, the movements started to receive support from the Architects Trade Union of Rio Grande do Sul. The Union offered its headquarters as a meeting space where professionals from different areas could meet with communitarian leaderships on a regular basis.  Contrary to NGO’s aiming at political instruction, CIDADE focused on technical training and capacity building in subjects related to the urban problematic. In May 1988, the assembly that founded the organization took place.We are a nongovernmental, non-for-profit organization, laic and autonomous in relation to the government and political parties. We have as our principles the right to citizenship and the autonomy of the popular movements.  The structural axis of our work is training for citizenship, knowledge about public management, analysis of social policies, research, and sharing information with participants in public spaces of communitarian organization, as well as communities in general.  We seek, in this way, to strengthen both democratic administration and community based organizations, using the Participatory Budgeting as our main tool.http://www.ongcidade.org/  ",0,0,0,0,0,

This is underpinned by the conviction that a random selection of everyday citizens are more than capable of navigating and making decisions about complex political issues. As founder Luca Belgiorno-Nettis (2013) puts it:  Our focus is on everyday people being randomly selected to deliberate and see if a consensus view can be reached. I am willing to trust these people because of the diversity of skills in the community, and the fact they are beyond the reach of so many impairments we place on the judgment of the representatives we elect today. They have no political donations, no factions, no pre-selections to worry about, no special interest groups to campaign against them, no lobbyists with connections to them, no faceless men looming in the background! [1]  nDF’s approach is firmly underpinned by deliberative democratic theory. In creating deliberative spaces – such as the  Australian Citizens’ Parliament  – the foundation aims to contribute to a future deliberative community as envisaged by prominent scholars.[2][3] Indeed, since newDemocracy’s inception in 2004, deliberative democracy scholars have begun to look to the idea of ‘deliberative systems’ as a way of conceptualising deliberative democracy writ large.[4] nDF's original objectives were, through the creation of deliberative spaces, to promote a broader shift towards a more participatory, consensus-based political system. This is in sharp contrast to the adversarial, polarising rhetoric of Australian party politics.  newDemocracy is now well established in Australia as one of the foremost practitioners of deliberative democracy. They are particularly well-known for expertise in the recruitment process and facilitation of  citizens’ juries , as their body of work attests. nDF also retains its original commitment to changing Australia’s political system for the better, through establishing effective mechanisms for everyday people to deliberate and make public decisions. This is reflected in their advocacy for a Citizens’ Senate – with a House of randomly selected citizens performing the review function of the Upper House. This is ‘the pragmatic option for a step toward a non-partisan and deliberative parliament.’[5]  The Citizens’ Senate is one of several structural alternatives advocated by nDF for improving how politics is done in Australia.[5] These include  Demarchy , and Electronic  Town hall  and a Citizens’ Legislature. The structural alternatives suggested are grounded in academic research and offer a vision for a different type of politics. Alongside this they also argue in favour of a raft of incremental alternatives – improvements that could be made to the current political system as it stands.  Origins and Development  nDF was founded in 2004 by Luca Belgiorno-Nettis, who ‘wanted to find out if innovation in democracy was possible. It is.’[1] newDemocracy’s inception was a considered response against the often toxic, tit-for-tat character of partisan politics in Australia. nDF advocated a real alternative to this in their support for deliberative democratic processes that gave ordinary people the time, space and relevant information to deliberate on the current political system and how it could be improved.  This alternative approach became tangible reality with the first Australian Citizens’ Parliament in 2009, funded by nDF and the Australian Research Council. The focus of the process – involving 150 randomly selected Australians – was to deliberate on how Australian’s political system could be strengthened to better serve its citizens.  Since the Citizens’ Parliament, nDF have become perhaps best known for their expertise in random selection and the organisation and facilitation of mini-publics. They have been commissioned by local councils and state governments across four states to run deliberative processes on diverse topics – from electoral reform to local infrastructure. In addition to running deliberative forums, nDF advocates deliberative democratic approaches – in particular the citizens’ jury model – directly to state and federal government through its submissions to various committees.Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingnDF is a non-profit, non-partisan organisation and relies primarily on donors[6] for its income and has received major donations from the Anita and Luca Belgiorno-Nettis Foundation and Google Australia. In addition, the foundation is commissioned by government and others to run various projects, which are budgeted on a cost recovery basis and vary project to project.  nDF also funds research into deliberative democracy more broadly.Specializations, Methods, and ToolsA  random selection  of citizens in a jury format – a  citizens’ jury  – is central to newDemocracy’s approach to improving the democratic process. The following information is summarised from the nDF website and describes their overall approach:[7]Random Selection:Governments inevitably hear from the noisiest voices who insist on being heard. In contrast, society trusts 12 randomly-selected people on a criminal jury to assess evidence, discuss their views and reach a consensus recommendation because random selection generates “people like us”. Our process gets beyond the enraged and the articulate because the public would perceive them as having a bias.Time:Most policy problems which warrant the investment in a jury will be complex topics, so we need to allow people the time to educate and immerse themselves in the topic. Faced with a clear remit and a worthwhile level of authority citizens will invest the time.Information:Neutrality of information is a core principle, and we are careful to alert all juries that all writers have their own bias and perspective and they need to critically analyse this. To counter the view that “you can find an expert to say anything” we focus the start of a process on asking “what do you need to know... and who would you trust to inform you” – and use this as a way of selecting the speakers and input for subsequent jury meetings.Clear remit:A plain English question, phrased neutrally is essential.Upfront authority:To get everyday people in the room making a considerable time commitment, they need to know that the recommendations they reach mean something and won’t be consumed within the bureaucracy.Operation:For the purposes of shifting the mindset from adversarial, two-party, either/or contests, nDF recommends an 80% supermajority be required for a final decision from the jury. In practice, they rarely need to go to a vote and decisions are frequently unanimous, however minority views can be recorded and noted in reports as the objective is to most accurately reflect the view of the room.How do we randomly select participants?nDF directly undertakes the jury selection process to ensure there is the highest public confidence in the rigour and independence of the randomisation of invitations. Random selection is the key tool used to identify a range of participants who meet a descriptively representative sample of the community. We match participants to Census data by the key variables of age and gender, and others as each project requires. This is not claimed as a perfect method, but it delivers a more representative sample than any other process.  We post invitations to a random sample of physical addresses (not billing addresses) drawn from land titles information or Australia Post databases. This ensures that tenants and those not on electoral rolls are reached – in short, the widest possible catchment. Recipients of the invitation are asked to register online to indicate that they are available for the final selection. Based on those available, a second random draw is done which seeks to randomly match to the age and gender numbers required. This draw generates the final membership of the jury.  nDF does not provide any juror information to the governments or agencies with which we work.Stakeholder EngagementSince its inception in 2004, nDF has sought to improve and innovate with its work. nDF-commissioned research conducted by the Institute for Sustainable Futures in 2015[8] found that stakeholders did not always feel they understood the deliberative process and for some, this led to disengagement. In response to this, nDF now includes  stakeholder  engagement as a key component in all of its research designs. This includes stakeholder briefings prior to the process beginning, identifying key stakeholders to present to a jury or panel, as well as offering jurors the opportunity to select stakeholders of their own choosing to present information. This is alongside witnesses chosen by the commissioning body (e.g. council) and submissions from the wider community.Major projects and eventsnDF has been responsible for over 20 deliberative processes, consultations and policy submissions. Their first major project was the  Australian Citizens’ Parliament  in 2009 which brought together 150 citizens from around the country.  Other major projects include the  City of Melbourne People’s Panel  in 2014, which involved a broad community engagement process alongside a citizens’ jury to contribute to Melbourne’s 10-year financial plan. nDF also led on two juries in  Sydney  and  Adelaide  on creating a safe and vibrant nightlife.  nDF’s full body of work – along with reports, project designs and government responses can be found  here .

Using broad-based community organising and leadership traning, it enables people to identify and meet their needs, so that they can participate more fully in local regeneration processes, in the development of effective local and national urban policy, and society in general.  Changemakers will allow local people to address issues not being tackled in other ways. These organisations will be large, diverse, disciplined, and led by ordinary local people who have been trained in community leadership. Changemakers represents an attempt to set direct, participatory forms of democratic activity alongside representative ones. The programme is responding to widespread apathy and cynicism about politics and citizen engagement. It is a way of enabling the poorest and most marginalised communities to have a voice at the table of power by claiming their own political spaces.Specializations and activities  The idea of Broad Based Organising is to build up community groups and to develop leadership skills. It is a values based process where people are brought together to act in the interest of their communities and the common good. It is a strategy that revitalises communities and allows the individuals to participate and incite social change. It empowers the people directly involved and inspires action for change.External Links  Change Makers Websites  [1][2]  ",0,0,0,0,0,

[i]Members of Involve's small but dynamic team ""specialize in, and promote public participation and deliberative democracy, public engagement, governance, facilitation, policymaking, research and much more."" [2]  Their aim is to involve citizens in public decision making through participatory democracy in a variety of forms. In both the UK and internationally, Involve has worked with numerous governments, parliaments, civil society organisations, academics, and the public. Through these partnerships they make a practical difference by developing resources, offering support, and campaigning for public participation processes by undertaking ongoing rigorous research and policy analysis.  Origins and Development  Involve was founded in 2003 by Richard Wilson to determine how new forms of public participation in government could strengthen democracy in Britain. Involve has offices in Belfast, Edinburgh, and London.Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingAs of 2021, Involve boasts 23 staff, 13 associates, and 9 Board members.  Everything we do is driven by our values:Collaboration – because change comes when broad coalitions of people worktowards a common vision;Equality – because everyone in society has an equal right to be listened to andparticipate in decisions that affect their lives. No one should be held back by societaldivisions or prejudice;Independence – because we are committed to the integrity and impartiality ofparticipatory and deliberative processes;Purpose – because participation must have an impact. We reject tokenistic orineffectual engagement; and,Quality – because effective participation requires time, attention and commitment. [3]Involve is classified as a charity and is funded through a variety of grants, awards, and donations; for a detailed list see  Who Funds Us .Specializations, Methods and ToolsInvolve has three focus areas:Making the case – demonstrating why participation and deliberation are essential features for a healthy modern democracy, and ensuring that those in positions of power and influence understand and support their use in addressing some of the UK’s most intractable issues.Embedding change – building the capacity of public servants and practitioners, and developing the body of evidence, principles and standards that support participatory and deliberative practice.Pioneering practice – encouraging widespread uptake of participatory and deliberative processes, and promoting continuous learning and innovation to improve democracy and deliver lasting solutions in key policy areas. [4] Through these specializations, Involve has transformed how leading public bodies and companies engage, including: Shell International, the OECD, Ministry of Justice, the  European Commission , the States of Jersey, the Sustainable Development Commission, the BBC and many local and regional governments.  Major Projects and Events  Involve's major projects can be sorted into five categories: (1) Unlocking citizen participation,(2) citizen participation in challenging issues, (3) embedding public engagement in government, (4) public engagement with fewer resources, and (5) promoting good practice.  1-Unlocking Citizen Participation  The goal of unlocking citizen participation is to explore what it is that citizens need in order to actively participate in their own communities. Past projects include Scouting Sunday, Involve and I&amp;DeA Informal Engagement in Health Guidance, and Say&amp;Play, a project meant to improve local government consultation by combining a community fun day with appropriate consultation methods. Currently they are working on Pathways through Participation, a lottery funded project exploring how and why people get involved and stay involved in different forms of participation throughout their lives.  2-Citizen Participation in Challenging Issues  To encourage citizen participation in challenging issues, Involve carries out research and develops new practices exploring how citizens can be engaged in complex technical or political debates to help decide a collaborative solution. Past projects include  The European Citizens' Consultation 2009 , a 3 stage  deliberation  event where citizens from all over Europe were assembled to deliberate on the continent's economic and social future. Currently they are working on putting together the Alberta Climate Dialogue, a similar event that will take place in Canada.  3-Embedding Public Engagement in Government  Involve projects with the goal of embedding public engagement in government focus on helping inwardly focused organizations to become more open to citizen involvement. A past success was Engaging With Impact, a joint project between Involve and  MASS LBP , a Canadian engagement innovator. The project examined the culture of engagement across Ontario's public health system, culminating in a report identifying indicators than can be used to improve public and patient engagement in the health area. Currently they are working on a project called Armchair Involvement where they conduct desk research, interviews, workshops and field research to identify the types of digital tools that are useful in encouraging patient and public involvement.  4-Public Engagement with Fewer Resources  Public engagement with fewer resources is aimed at discovering techniques to make getting citizens involved more efficient and effective. Involve conducts research to evaluate where public engagement can add value, and how to reduce government costs and make more effective decisions. An ongoing project is the Valuing Public Engagement project, a collaboration with Consumer Focus England to develop an equation for identifying costs and benefits associated with public engagement. They are also currently working on Efficiency Savings Through Engagement, where Involve provides a number of activities such as auditing current engagement activities, delivering a wide array of cost effective training, and building internal capacity through training and mentoring.  5-Promote Good Practice  Involve also promotes good practices for engagement activities in order to encourage others to participate. Their most notable project in this aspect was preparing a guide and providing mentorship for the staff from Multilateral Organisation Performance Assessment Network (MOPAN) by outlining how to design and run effective dialogues with citizens. MOPAN a group of 14 donor nations surveying and assessing multilateral organizations in developing countries.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Involve is an organization that promotes deliberative and participatory forms of democracy and decision-making. They provide a solid and well-researched information base along with the resources and support needed further engagement and to discover the best techniques for more involved change.

They specialise in gender awareness training; research and consultancy on gender equality issues; and supporting women and grassroots women's groups to develop their potential.  Their aim is to raise awareness of gender inequality in society, its causes, and how it can be addressed, particularly by UK community, voluntary and statutory sector organisations.  In their community work, they follow the principles of popular education, which involves raising consciousness of how an individual's personal experiences are connected to larger societal problems. They are committed to reflective practice and shared, participatory learning.History  The GAP Unit (formerly Gender and Participation Unit) was founded in 2007. It was originally hosted by the [ Community Audit and Evaluation Centre ] at Manchester Metropolitan University, but was constituted as an independent Community Interest Company in January 2009.  The seeds of the GAP Unit were sown by the GEM Project— participatory research into the gender dynamics of community engagement in Manchester, which was carried out by Manchester Women’s Network. The research found that women were under-represented in political decision-making in the city , particularly at higher levels. Dissemination of the findings led to advocacy work and development of training programmes to help address some of the needs and gaps identified. These included greater general understanding of gender equality issues within the community, voluntary and public sectors, and confidence building for women, who were generally less comfortable than men in formal public meetings.  The GEM Project team set up the GAP Unit in response to a high demand for advice and training from local and regional organisations, big and small. They also wanted to be able to provide support to grassroots women’s groups, through self-esteem and empowerment projects and other activities based on the principles of participatory community education.Specializations and activities  GAP unit specialises in the following areas Community development, Research and consultancy (using a variety of participatory research methods) as well as Training (in Gender, diversity and inequality; Capacity building; Research methods; and Empowerment sessions).External LinksGAP Unit  ",1,0,0,0,0,

They aim to strengthen parliamentary democracy and encourage greater public involvement in politics. At the heart of their work is the principle that civic society is most effective when its citizens are connected with the institutions and individuals who represent them in the democratic process.Specializations and activities  They inform decision makers and engage the public in politics by:providing a platform for debate on current issues around Parliament, constitutional affairs, participation and engagement;  generating wide-reaching recommendations to improve parliamentary and legislative processes through timely and rigorous research;  pushing the boundaries of new technology and its abilities to engage the public with policy makers  creating and promoting fresh and accessible resources to help teachers present the citizenship  curriculum in an innovative and interesting way;  running training sessions for teachers and policy professionals to enable them to understand a range of political issues and processes effectively;  bringing students from across the globe to study the British political system and to gain experience through internships in a wide variety of political organisations;History  The Hansard Society was established in 1944 to promote the ideals of the parliamentary system of government and to ensure that democracy would be safeguarded by being understood, debated and improved by parliamentarians and the public. Their first members were Winston Churchill and Clement Attlee, and since then the Prime Minister of the day and leaders of the main opposition parties have publicly supported the work of the Hansard Society. The Speaker of the House of Commons is the President of the Hansard Society and the leaders of the three major political parties are our Vice Presidents.  From its inception the Hansard Society has promoted the importance of political education in schools and among their most well-known activities are their Mock Elections, which provide an informative and hands-on way for young people to gain a taste of the electoral process. This work has developed over the years to include forums and debates held online to enable engagement with young people through the use of new technology. The Hansard Society's pioneering work in schools led to what is now called Citizenship Education and they continue to ensure that teachers have free access to knowledge, training sessions and stimulating resources.  Since the 1970s the Hansard Society has organised and published research on many aspects of parliamentary democracy, critically examining social and political developments that affect Parliament, seeking to provide authoritative analysis of problems and suggest practical improvements. One important mechanism for this has been the establishment of independent Commissions of Enquiry chaired by eminent parliamentarians or academics. These have included pioneering work on electoral reform, representation of women, reform of the legislative process and the role of scrutiny in Parliament.  In 1985 the Hansard Society established the prestigious Hansard Scholars and Hansard Research Scholars Programmes in association with the London School of Economics. These programmes attract future political leaders from across the globe, to study and work in Westminster. Since it's creation, the study programme has expanded to include training for charities, journalists, companies and other organisations that need to understand how the parliamentary system works. The innovative and forward thinking eDemocracy Programme was created in 1997 to explore the possibilities, through research and pilot projects, for greater connections between new technologies and politics. The Programme focuses on ways in which democratic institutions can adapt to an age defined by digital communications and how new technology can improve public engagement with politics.In 2000 the Hansard Society extended its work to include issues of devolution and an office in Scotland was set up to respond to the changing political circumstances in British politics. The Hansard Society Scotland Programme holds fringe events at the Scottish National Party's Conference and provides a platform for debate about issues relating to devolution and the Scottish Parliament. It also provides free resources on Citizenship Education to Scottish schools and has recently expanded to include a Hansard Society Scotland Scholars programme in association with the University of Edinburgh.  More than 60 years on, the Hansard Society is recognised as an independent and non-partisan authority on Parliament and democracy. Today, their work encompasses a wide range of areas, from citizenship education to the role of Parliament, from devolution to the impact of new media on politics. In addition, they organise events in Westminster with high-profile speakers, host influential seminars and hold popular fringe events at Party Conferences.External LinksHansard Society  ",1,0,0,0,0,

Their alliance works to share information, build knowledge and visibility, and effectively promote a citizen voice in government decision-making processes. Fundamental to the DDC’s work is the belief that the outcomes of  deliberation  result in qualitatively better and longer lasting decisions on policy matters, and that participation in deliberative opportunities is vital to reviving democracy. The DDC has set out on an impressive research agenda that aims to build knowledge around the actual impact of deliberation on civic attitudes and behavior. Their hypothesis is that: “with expanded application, increased frequency and greater visibility, deliberative democracy can invigorate and rekindle the civic virtues of trust, participation and responsibility.” The DDC believes that democratic deliberation is an influential, transformational experience for everyone involved, which can shift people’s attitudes toward the institutions and practice of democracy overall.  The Consortium has committed to the following goalsHelp public leaders find the examples and resources they need to engage citizens  Integrate research and practice in the field  Integrate online and face-to-face approaches  Articulate how democracy is changing  Help to build a permanent infrastructure for deliberative democracy  Encourage research and practice to support all aspects of deliberative democracy  Design of, and experimentation with, innovative deliberative practices  Develop evaluation models and tools  Relationship building, collaboration and convening within the field  Create connections between the field of deliberation and other related fields  Disseminate results to the public, decision-makers, academics, etc.  Promote the philosophy and methods of deliberative democracy to all levels of government  Increase the credibility and visibility of the deliberative democracy movement in the United States and around the world [1]Origins and Development  The DDC was founded in 2002 by leading organizations in the field of deliberative democracy. Tonya Gonzalez was the Consortium's first director; Matt Leighninger became the second in 2006 and the position is now held by Wendy Willis. [2]Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The activities of the Consortium are coordinated by an Executive Committee, chaired by Wendy Willis, Founder and Director of Oregon’s Kitchen Table Program, and co-chairs Kyle Bozentko or the  Jefferson Center  and Bruce L. Mallory, co-director of New Hampshire Listens. [3]   Organizational members of the Consortium include the  National Coalition for Dialogue and Deliberation  (NCDD), the  Jefferson Center , the  Kettering Foundation ,  Public Agenda , and  Everyday Democracy . [4]Specializations, Methods and ToolsOnline DeliberationWorkshopsMajor Projects and Events  The DDC used to comprise several Task Groups who organized activities associated with knowledge building, democratic governance, online deliberation and linking to government.  Knowledge Building  The Knowledge Building (KB) Task Group identified the necessary questions and collaborators that will advance knowledge and practice in the field of deliberative democracy. KB was led by Archon Fung (Harvard University) and Peter Levine (CIRCLE). The KB Task Group organized three Researcher and Practitioner Workshops in 2003, 2005, and 2007. The mission of the group was to “increase the quantity, quality and availability of knowledge about the theory and practice of deliberative democracy through: (1) setting the scholarly research agenda, (2) conducting high-quality research and experimentation on deliberative democratic practices, and (3) collecting and distributing knowledge about theory and practice to researchers and practitioners.”  Major goals the KB task group identified and worked towards included:Increasing academic research and experimentation on deliberative democratic practices and shape the agenda for that research and experimentation.  Expanding discussion of such experiments in scholarly work on deliberation and democracy.  Improving knowledge and understanding of how deliberative democratic institutions function, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of various models.  Increasing information about the outcomes of deliberative processes and highlight their value to various constituencies.  Developing better assessment tools.  Increasing interaction and communication amongst researchers and practitioners and develop an ongoing network among them. [5]FedNet  The FedNet (Federal Network) Task Group, also known as the Link to Government (LTG) group, convened federal officials from different countries to discuss ways of bringing together democratic deliberation and federal policy-making. The LTG was formed to identify opportunities and come up with strategies to promote and support citizen deliberation in government decision-making. The task group included representatives from the Centers for Disease Control, the EPA, and international organizations such as the Danish Board of Technology. The LTG worked to bring together civic engagement resources for elected officials and government agency practitioners. Their stated goals were to  (1) Champion deliberative democracy before government  (2) Build knowledge around existing practice  (3) Raise level of awareness within the DDC, elsewhere of government views and practice with regards to citizen engagement and deliberation.  (4) Raise level, quality of practice of deliberative democracy in government  To meet these objectives, the LTG developed specific proposals, which included:Developing a ""federal network for deliberation"" that shared information about the state of practice within various executive and legislative institutions.  Creating a ""best practices in deliberation"" award for federal managers and others.  Identifying research questions that are compelling for federal public participation practitioners. [6]Online DeliberationThe Online Deliberative Democracy Consortium (ODDC) was the DDC’s task group for supporting online innovation in the field of deliberation. Their mission was to build knowledge and track improvements made within the field of online deliberation. The ODDC created a number of online features, which include:Deliberative-democracy.net: the Internet’s number one destination for news about deliberative democracy. It receives 3,000-4,000 hits each month and is the second site to appear when the words “deliberative democracy” are searched on Google.  The d-d.net eBulletin: a monthly electronic newsletter that highlights recent activity in the field, distributed via email to more than 700 subscribers.  The Democracy Movement: a group blog maintained by more than a dozen leading scholars and practitioners in the field, that raises topics of interest related to democratic deliberation for discussion.  The FedNet wiki: provides a private network for federal government managers to develop a community of practice through online knowledge sharing and networking.  The Deliberative Democracy Handbook Online: a section of the d-d.net website dedicated entirely to the Handbook, providing chapter summaries, author bios, and discussion boards. [7]Online Deliberative Democracy Workgroup  Much of the DDC’s online activities were done through the Online Deliberative Democracy Workgroup (ODDW). This network of online deliberation leaders met monthly to talk about their recent activities and to come up with strategies to encourage online deliberation efforts around the world. In June 2005, the ODDW held a regional meeting in St. Paul, Minnesota, called “Deepening Online Deliberation Through Practice and Research.” The meeting was attended by state and local elected officials whom regarded it as highly productive. [8]Democratic Governance  Developed tools for leaders who are using deliberative strategies in their work. [9]Ongoing Projects and Events  The DDC partners have given assistance to hundreds of public involvement projects that have engaged hundreds of thousands of people in dialogue, deliberation, and problem-solving. Many of these projects have included young people, recent immigrants, and low-income people; those who are normally considered “hard to reach.” [10]  Past and ongoing projects include:Meetings and conferences such as the annual “Frontiers of Democracy” conference; special Researcher &amp; Practitioner meetings, and sessions at the annual conferences of the National League of Cities (NLC), International City and County Management Association (ICMA), National Coalition for Dialogue and Deliberation (NCDD), and many other associations.  Participatory innovations such as Text, Talk, and Act, a nationwide,  text-enabled , face-to-face discussion that has engaged thousands of young people in dialogue and action on issues of mental health, as part of President Obama’s  National Dialogue on Mental Health .  Participatory reforms such as the Model Ordinance on Public Participation and Model State Act on Public Participation, created by a working group (coordinated by DDC) that included the International Municipal Lawyers’ Association, American Bar Association, National Civic League, Policy Consensus Initiative, NLC, ICMA, and NCDD.

The IOPD is mainly focused on growing participatory government on the local scale with the aim of deepening the roots of democracy in municipal government.[1]  As an international network, the IOPD goes under several different names: Observatorio Internacional de la Democracia Participativa (OIDP),[2] Observatoire international de la démocratie participative (OIDP),[3] and Observatório Internacional da Democracia Participativa (OIDP).[4]  Origins and Development  The network was created in 2001 within the framework of the  European Commission ’s URB-AL programme for decentralized cooperation. It was officially constituted in November 2001 during the 1st Annual Conference of the IOPD in Barcelona, where their internal operating regulations were approved. Since 2006, the IOPD has coordinated with United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG), mainly on the design of a joint framework of collaboration with the Committee on Social Inclusion and Participatory Democracy (CSIPD).  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The IOPD Presidency and the Technical Secretariat are the two basic internal bodies and are held by associates of the cities and local governments that belong to the IOPD network. Appointments to these posts are reached through  consensus  vote held at the annual assembly. The Presidency is held for one year and the winning candidate city must agree to host that year’s annual conference. The conference is hosted by a city on a different continent each year.  The General or Technical Secretariat post is held for 3 years and is renewable. The position has been held by the Barcelona City Council since the creation of the network.[5]  The Technical Secretariat carries out the daily work of the network, including management of the website and media library, preparation and publicisation of the IOPD initiatives and annual international conference. The Technical Secretariat is also the public face of the the IOPD, acting as the network’s representative and maintaining relations with the member institutions.[6]  The Coordinating Committee was created in 2004 to improve network efficiency. Comprising “the most active, committed associate and collaborating members of the network,” the committee meets several times a year, following up on projects and initiatives, and contributing proposals and suggestions for the improvement and development of the IOPD.[7]  In November 2011, a collaboration agreement was reached with the city of Porto Alegre to head the regional office of the OIDP for Latin America. This decentralisation of the organisation's structure was taken in an attempt to improve efficiency. In line with this need, the International Observatory for Participatory Democracy Platform for Africa was launched in Dakar on December 2012. Coordinated by ENDA-Ecopop, the platform focuses on local community initiatives, resources for participatory innovators, a forum for discussions on topics related to democratic governance, and online training and web conferencing.[8]  Established in 2001, the IOPD network now has over 800 members in 91 countries including towns, cities, associations, organisations, and research centres dedicated to the study and implementation of participatory democracy. There are no membership dues and membership is open to all who apply.[9]  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Since 2011, the IOPD has focused its efforts on becoming a space for the production and exchange of knowledge around participatory democracy and good governance among the towns and cities that are party to the network. This work is largely carried out through its online repository of publications and case studies, annual conference, working groups, and ‘Best Practice in Citizens’ Participation’ Award. It is committed to diversifying the composition of its network and to decentralizing its structure in order to help identify, evaluate, and orient the development of participatory democracy in local contexts. The IOPD actively pursues collaboration and relationships with international organizations.[10]  Major Projects and Events  International Conference  Every year since its creation, the IOPD has held an international conference to advance discussions on participatory democracy and enable those attending to share experience and information in this field.[11]  IOPD Distinction for Good Practice in Citizen Participation  An award is given to recognize innovative experiences in participatory democracy that favour citizen participation and involvement in the preparation and implementation of public policies.[12]  Local Observatories on Participatory Democracy  In 2004, the IOPD undertook a project to create a network of “Local Observatories on Participatory Democracy” (LOPDs) to develop an evaluatory method for participation, informed by a wide variety of political, social, economic and regional perspectives. Ten LOPDs were established in Europe and Latin America. While the choice and development of the LOPDs’ goals and methodologies depended on the needs and characteristics of their social realities, their work was to be carried out with an eye to joint action. The project was carried out within the framework of the URB-AL Programme and concluded in April 2007.[13]  IOPD Work Groups  The definition of the IOPD work groups has taken shape within the framework of the annual conference. Reflection focuses on ways of promoting tools that strengthen democracy and give added impetus to the active participation of citizens in debates, designs, decisions, and the implementation of public policies. All interested IOPD members may participate in the work groups and contribute to them. Each group is coordinated by a city, which, with the support of the Technical Secretariat, is responsible for issuing framework documents on work to be carried out, collecting contributions from members and making the work group as dynamic as possible. One of the results of these work groups is the Local Observatories on Participatory Democracy project, which was originally included within the framework of the European Commission’s URB-AL programme for decentralized cooperation. Its main goal is to create local observatories in a number of European and Latin American cities to identify, evaluate and orient the development of different forms of participatory democracy and thereby to help direct the course of experiences that are under way.[14]  Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

They believe that today the challenges of democratic participation, social equality, and cultural innovation cannot be effectively understood and addressed at the nation state level.  The organisation sees itself as a breeding ground for new ideas and proposals for politics and culture at a European level and in being a political and cultural actor with a truly transeuropean activity, staff and support base.  The reflexion and action of European Alternatives is targeted in the first instance at the European Union and European nation states, but the political and cultural horizon of the organisation is global, as are the collaborations it tries to foster.Activities  Imagining Alternatives  • Research, publications, and transnational seminars to formulate, from the ground-up and through the participation of citizens and members of their local groups, a wide series of political proposals for the Europe to come.  • Transeuropa Festival an innovative simultanous festival taking place in 4 cities mixing cultural, political, and artistic engagement across borders.  • Artistic projects, such as the recent Polis21, inviting artists to imagine alternative proposals for society and political community. Democratic participation  • Local Groups: they stimulate active participation from the bottom-up in all areas of their work through many active local groups running a rich programme of local activities  • Democratising the EU: they push for greater democratisation of the European political process, advocating greater participation of citizens, civil society and social movements in the decision-making of the European Union. They do so by representing these voices in consultations with the European institutions, by running initiatives reinforcing the role of the European parliament, and in promoting the emergence of a political Europe of alternative choices by analysis and debate of current European policies.  • Campaigns: they contribute to the emergence of pan-European social movements working to transform national demands and campaigns into transnational advocacy. They do so by running regular campaigns on themes as varied as media pluralism and women’s rights. Transnational Public Sphere  • They publish a printed magazine in English and an online magazine in 3 languages to stimulate interaction with their work and contribute to the shared formulation of political proposals across language barriers, promoting the development of a transnational space for interaction and discussion of political and cultural issues.External LinksEuropean Alternatives  ",0,0,0,0,0,

By cooperating and working in concert with one another, the goal of the organization is to bring about increased participation in local governments and growth of democracy.  With social justice being one of its main priorities, LogoLink operates to develop hands-on methods in hopes of engaging the public in social and political activities. A primary issue the organization is concerned with is the level of transparency and inclusiveness that exist within local government structures. LogoLink views communication between a government and its citizens as the foundation of a successful democracy. Because of this, the organization is dedicated to promoting transparency among government bodies and increasing the level of interaction they have with their constituents.  Some key objectives of the LogoLink network include:  • Construct areas where learning, sharing, and innovation can occur between members  • Devote major attention to practical and relatable expressions of democracy  • Cultivate relationships between governments and their citizens that are more reciprocal and balancedHistory  Most LogoLink participants are civil servants from various regions who have networked with one another in order to achieve common goals. Since social justice is founded in democratic practices, this network seeks to strengthen democratic systems and customs. The 2007 transfer of LogoLink’s central directive institute—Institute of Development Studies—from the University of Sussex to The Polis Institute in the South reflects the unwavering commitment of the organization to the improvement of less developed areas of the world  [1] . LogoLink has great faith in the South’s capabilities with respect to planning and directing the affairs of global networks. LogoLink formed an Executive Committee to serve as a resource for governments. The Committee works together with the Internal Advisory Council, part of The Polis Institute, in order to provide optimal support for LogoLink partners.Activities  Through a variety of projects, workshops, and research initiatives LogoLink is involved in the creation of practical expressions of democracy to be adopted by communities and their governments.  PROJECTS:  • Systematization &amp; Knowledge Dissemination As LogoLink’s current project, it involves the formation of a system by which to organize and present its purpose, progress in its first 10 years, and goals  [2] . This process is comprised of two main steps, the first being documentation and the second is systematization. Basically, the organization is creating a broad and general bank of principles, guidelines, and information which it hopes participants to adopt those portions that are relevant to their particular conditions.  • Participatory Planning This project occurred in the earliest phases of LogoLink’s existence, spanning over 2001 and part of 2002. It involved extensive research mainly in an effort to recreate lessons observed during fieldwork relating to participatory planning. This research period led to an international workshop during which case studies were discussed and examined. Workshop participants included 34 civil society organizations, local governments, and research institutions from 18 different nations around the world  [3] . The workshop gave each of the groups a chance to share their perspectives and exchange ideas about the lessons presented by LogoLink.  • ReCite (Resources, Citizen Engagements and Democratic Local Governance) This project was LogoLink’s third major endeavor. At the beginning of 2004 the organization began a large-scale research mission  [4] . The ultimate goal of the project was to come up with ways for citizens to more consistently engage in local governance. The organization discovered that numerous obstacles restrict citizens’ opportunities to participate in political activities in their area. As a result, LogoLink sought to create spaces and situations in which people would be able to engage in political processes and campaigns.  • Democratic Local Governance Fighting Inequality This 2008 project was the product of earlier work done by the organization  [5] . The key focuses of this phase of research were inequality and poverty in various environments around the world. LogoLink worked to improve the level of inclusiveness within systems in order to decrease the presence of inequality between citizens and their leaders.  • Legal Frameworks for Citizen Participation This project spanned across 15 countries and occurred as a result of the work done by numerous individuals across these areas in 2003  [6] . The main concern driving this project were the legal frameworks present within different areas and even more importantly, the citizens’ knowledge of these frameworks and their relation to them. The objective of this project was to adapt previously-successful models to different regional contexts.  WORKSHOPS (All info from here on must be cited, there was no way to not give the exact facts)  • LogoLink regional partners meeting – 2005  Cape Town, South Africa  Participants: partners from Central America, the Andean region, South America, South and Southeast Asia, Eastern and Southern Africa, and the North  • East Africa Regional Conference on Citizen Engagement in Local Governance Mukono district, Uganda Participants: 27 representatives from Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. These participants acted as a forum for LogoLink’s East African partners to discuss democracy and participation  • South Africa’s Good Governance Learning Network Workshop on Municipal Performance Management Cape Town, South Africa Purpose: to learn about the performance of South African municipalities and explore ways to improve public participation and checks on government  RESEARCH Out of concern for participation in local governments among communities in the Global South, LogoLink has sponsored research projects like the Legal Frameworks for Citizens Participation research initiative.  INFORMATION EXCHANGE LogoLink disseminates information through several different mechanisms. Its methods of communication vary from exchange visits to document exchange and interactive online meetings.Funding  The LogoLink organization reports that its primary funding and support comes from the Ford Foundation. The organization’s Coordination Unit is located at The Polis Institute in Sao Paulo, Brazil. LogoLink collaborates with a variety of partners from all over the globe, among these is Instituto Polis in Brazil, Instituto de Estudios Peruanos in Peru, Centro de Servicios Municipales Heriberto Jara in Mexico, Institute for Popular Democracy in the Philippines, The Society for Participatory Research in Asia in India, Development Network of Indegenous Voluntary Associations in Uganda, the Foundation for Contemporary Research in South Africa, The Deliberative Democracy Consortium in the US, and the Institute of Development Studies in the UK.Partners  LogoLink's Coordination Unit works closely with partners in different regions of the world, including the Instituto Polis in Brazil; Grupo Nacional de Trabajo para la Participación in Bolivia; the Institute for Popular Democracy in the Philippines; the Society for Participatory Research in Asia, in India; DENIVA, in Uganda; the Foundation for Contemporary Research, in South Africa; and the Deliberative Democracy Consortium, in the USA.Analysis  LogoLink has played a vital role in the collection and distribution of information relating to the deliberative process within democracies. In April 2003, after a great deal of collaborative research stemming from LogoLink’s PHASE II project, the organization released a publication, “Legal Frameworks for Citizen Participation: a synthesis report.” The main aims of the project was: to conduct a comprehensive, comparative survey of legal and policy frameworks for citizen participation in local governance that operate in countries or states of federal republics in four regions (East Africa, Latin America, South Asia, South-East Asia); to synthesize existing knowledge about how these frameworks work in practice; and to draw lessons about the effectiveness of particular kinds of legal and policy framework for promoting citizen participation, including the importance of context in making models work or limiting their effectiveness, and the scope for transferring models into different country or regional contexts.  [6]In 2004, through the PHASE III project, “ReCite,” LogoLink effectively contributed to the knowledge of participation in local governance and through research, campaigns, and learning lessons, helped strengthen the capacities of LogoLink partners.  LogoLink’s PHASE IV project, “Democratic Local Governance Fighting Inequality,” had LogoLink’s partners engaging in a new research project. The research aimed to deepen knowledge on local democratic governance environments by pointing out other processes, factors and the central role of social and political actors, providing analysts, government decision-makers, citizen representatives and international development agencies with a critical assessment of existing experiences.  [7]  All of the projects LogoLink has been working on have helped spread the ideals of a deliberative democratic system.References↑LogoLink - About Us (Accessed Dec, 4 2010)↑Systematization &amp; Knowledge Dissemination (Accessed Dec, 4 2010)↑Participatory Planning (Accessed Dec, 4 2010)↑ReCite (Accessed Dec, 4 2010)↑Democratic Local Governance Fighting Inequality (Accessed Dec, 4 2010)↑  6.06.1Legal Frameworks For Citizen Participation (Accessed Dec, 4 2010)↑Democratic Local Governance Fighting Inequality (Accessed Dec, 4 2010)Secondary Sources  Suale Jr., Nelson, Alejandra M.

IAP2 carries out their mission by organizing and conducting activities to:Serve the learning needs of members through events, publications, and communication technology;  Advocate for public participation throughout the world;  Promote a results-oriented research agenda and use research to support educational and advocacy goals;  Provide technical assistance to improve public participation.IAP2 was founded in 1990 as the International Association of Public Participation Practitioners (IAP3) to respond to the rising global interest in public participation. The initial mission was to promote the values and best practices associated with involving the public in government and industry decisions which affect their lives. The founding members assembled a Board of Directors, developed by-laws and policies, and organized the first annual conference in Portland, Oregon, in 1992. Practitioners, both professional and volunteer, were identified as the primary constituents for membership; a newsletter and an annual conference were selected as initial IAP2 activities.  IAP2 quickly grew and developed into an organization which looks beyond the formal practitioner to include all people involved in public participation. IAP2 added a semi-annual journal, web site, and local chapters to its list of services. In 1996, IAP2 changed its name to reflect this growing diversity and inclusiveness of membership. The organization has grown from 300 members in 1992 to over 1,050 in 2007, with members from 26 countries. Conferences have been held every year since 1992, alternating between U.S. and Canadian locales.  In the past few years, IAP2 has continued its growth and established itself as a leader in the field. In 1999, IAP2 launched its Certificate Training Course in Public Participation providing comprehensive training in the tools and skills needed for effective participation. The 13th annual Core Values Awards for Excellence in Public Participation were awarded in Scarborough, UK, in October 2010.  IAP2 is organized at the local and national levels as Affiliates. Each Affiliate hosts networking, professional development and training opportunities.

Demos' vision is a democracy of free citizens, with an equal stake in society. They search for and communicate ideas to give people more power to shape their own lives.  Their work is animated by four themes:  Capabilities  Personal resources – such as skills, character, health and material resources - deeply affect people's ability to shape their own lives. Their programme of work on capabilities focus on the skills and traits people need to lead a fulfilled and autonomous life and how families, communities and schools can support children and young people in developing them.  Independence  Institutions can sap power by narrowing choice and cultivating dependency. They should be built on the presumption that power belongs with individuals rather than professionals. To live freely and independently – to be able choose our own path through life – is a goal of open, democratic societies.  Citizenship  Individuals belonging to a community are inter-dependent, so decisions about the shared conditions of life must be taken together. Active citizenship underpins a free, open and fair society but inequality inhibits their ability to participate fully. Broader, more flexible definitions of citizenship will be needed to foster a healthier civil society.  Security  Security underpins our everyday lives. While the primary duty of government is the safety of its citizens and the protection of the national interest, the range and complexity of security issues is forcing us to revaluate existing approaches and policies. In doing so their focus is shifting away from the state and exploring the role of the individual.Origins and DevelopmentOrganizational Structure, Membership, and FundingSpecializations, Methods and ToolsMajor Projects and EventsAlongside and connected with the four themes, which form the cornerstones of Demos work programme, they are also running a series of projects with a particular focus, including Culture, Progressive Conservatism and The Future of Capital.Analysis and Lessons LearnedPublicationsSee AlsoNanodialogues Public Engagement on Nanotechnology (UK)ReferencesExternal LinksDemosDemos limited, registered charity no. 1042046Notes  ",1,0,0,6,0,

Essential Partners fosters communication and understanding of where each person is coming from in order to create human relationships and tolerance with even those who might have opinions and ideas from the opposite spectrum.[3] [4] As well, the organization hopes to make people realize that those that might have been considered adversaries prior to their trained dialogues, can now work with each other toward a shared goal.[5]  Essential Partners works with people from all sides of the world in order to truly bond everything from universities, other non-profit organizations, community groups, government agencies, faith communities, issue advocates, professionals in mediation and dispute resolution and private citizens.[6] They believe that it’s possible to bring any two people together and create a conversation of substance that will allow individuals to understand that together they can reach an area of common ground.[7]  Origins and Development  Family therapist and philanthropist Laura Chasin conceived the idea in 1989.[8] After witnessing a debate on abortion on television, Chasin began to question how family therapy practices could improve polarizing conversations about abortion or other intense public issues.[9] Essential Partners was founded the same year under the name 'The Public Conversations Project', but did not enter the public’s eye until a shooting in 1994 where a man named “John Salvi walked into the Planned Parenthood clinic in Brookline and opened fire with a rifle”, seriously wounding three people and killing the receptionist.[10] Salvi then went on to drive two miles down Beacon Street to Preterm Health Services where he injured two more people and killed another receptionist.[11] This violent incident caused the already substantial divide between those that were pro-life and those that were pro-choice to grow even larger, but it was because of this incident that three people who are prominent figures from both sides decided it was necessary to sit down and have a civilized conversation in order to prevent incidents like this from occurring again.  These six people went to Essential Partners and met in private using the organization's method of communicating.[12] They learned about each other as people, started to care for one another, and realized the power and personal effect of vocabulary.[13] Through Essential Partners' methods and techniques of dialogue and communication, they were able to mend the gap in a way where they could be civil to one another and respect one another’s ideas and concerns.[14] The article ""Talking with the Enemy"", published in The Boston Globe, showed the public what had been happening in secrecy and really brought people’s attention to Essential Partners as an organization that created constructive dialogues about all different conflicts.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Essential Partners' members provide “training, facilitation, coaching, and consultation” to communities and other organizations that wish to work with them.[15] Fixed in Boston, they often travel outside the city to communities that request their assistance.[16]It wasn’t until 1996 when they received an initial grant from William and Flora Hewlett Foundation that PCP became a nonprofit organization.[18] Having Essential Partners become a non-profit organization means that they are always interested in foundations funding and supporting their vision. The organization has been fortunate enough to have many different foundations fund their organization in order to continue bringing people together. Some foundations that have been interested in their work include The Boston Foundation, United States Institute of Peace, Rockefeller Foundation, W.K. Kellogg Foundation and many more. Essential Partners began life as 'the Public Conversations Project', a Family Institute of Cambridge-funded initiative.[17]Aside from receiving funding from foundations, Essential Partners, also accepts donations from individuals or other organizations that feel that what the organization has done is useful and right for not only the country but also the world.  Specializations, Methods, and Tools  While Essential Partners' underlying philosophy or 'theory of change' is not entirely unique, its innovative methods, tools, and techniques of communication have seen success in the creation of constructive,  sustained dialogues . The way Essential Partners' staff facilitates and teaches people how to communicate with one another has roots in family systems therapy methods and goals. The goal with using family therapist skills is to prevent people from seeing each other as enemies but to see each other through personal experiences and deeper understandings. Their goal is not to change people’s minds or make the group come out with one answer to the problem, but more so to have people come out with respect for the other side and understanding of where each person is coming from. They hope to make connections between people that before would have assumed there was no way to relate to someone with such an opposing view. They, like many other organizations, wish to promote public  deliberation , thereby encouraging participation in democracy through their methods of constructive conversations.[19] Although public deliberation typically is more based around decision-making, Essential Partners does not intend for the group to come out with a decision, but to instead come out more enlightened.  Essential Partners has three methods in order to provide productive dialogue. First, it takes preventative measures in order to guarantee that the conversation won’t turn into a debate. All those that intend to participate in the conversation are contacted before and are asked to listen to some ground rules, such as not talking over one another and waiting till the facilitator has asked you a question.[20] This is to ensure that no one in the group gets attacked, or feels as though they must put their guard up and not truly say how they feel. Secondly, Essential Partners has a variety of facilitative processes such as keeping the conversation on track, asking the questions, setting the tone of the interactions and conversation and enforcing the ground rules.[21] Lastly, Essential Partners works with the participants in creating the overall process such as the ground rules.[22] They allow the participants to work together to realize what rules should be instituted in order to avoid offense.[23] This is the beginning of showing the group what things affect what people and making everyone more conscious of even the little things. The point of these three steps is to get the participants to realize that in no shape or form are they there to try to change people’s mind or to prove that they are right. The aim is for everyone to share experiences and talk about who they are in order to really show each other what it’s like in their shoes.  Major Projects and Events  Essential Partners has led many major projects and events relating to dialogue, communications, and conflict resolution. Emblematic of its work is a 2017 project to diffuse the polarizing rhetoric of journalistic reporting on the Isreali-Palestinian conflict. Like the majority of Essential Parterns' other work, the project brought both sides of the conflict together in dialogue. Five Israeli and five Palestinian journalists engaged in a series of dialogue workshops around the challenges of reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.[24] The hope was that through the dialogue workshop, the participants would gain better understanding of each other’s experiences and constraints.[25] This project demonstrates Essential Partners committment to the use of deliberation in conflict resolution and management in America and abroad. Besides international conflict, Essential Partners has brought people together around issues like health care, higher education and various matters of public policy.[26]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  With their unique methodology and powerful theory of change, Essential Partners has proven the ability for dialogue to resolve conflict and build mutual understanding. The Essential Partners organization as a non-profit and non-partisan entity, has grown to become a place where people of all sides can be heard and valued for who they are.[27] The organization continues to show people that just because a person may think one way they have the ability to listen to the other side comfortably, professionally and honorably without creating hatred and fear. It is likely for this reason that they have been asked to work with all different types of groups from universities to community groups.[28] Essential Partners serves many different groups from all different backgrounds in order to get one thing out of it for them, which is a chance to genuinely communicate.[29] Since Essential Partners has become seen as an organization with a lot of power to bring people together, they have been working on projects to expand not just in America but also around the world.  Publications  Essential Partners, formerly the Public Conversations Project, has been mentioned in the news all around the country in order to make people aware of what is going on and what the organization has to offer.[30] Some of the most famous publications of PCP include an article from Newsday where an Associate named Mary Jacksteit answered questions about how she would be able to help resolve the conflicts over abortion and health care reform.[31] Answering these kinds of questions in the news allows the public to see the methods that Essential Partners uses and the successes Essential Partners has the ability to have. Furthermore, PCP has been mentioned in articles discussing how two very opposite sides have had the ability to talk and communicate with one another and how these polarized sides have come to PCP with the hope that they can someday understand one another and reach some form of common ground. When the  National Coalition for Dialogue and Deliberation  [32] asked on their website, ncdd.org, which programs have addressed the partisan divide in the U.S. through dialogue, deliberation and conflict resolution, PCP was mentioned and recommended for this very cause.[33]  See AlsoNational Coalition for Dialogue and Deliberation   References  [1] [2] “About us.”  Public Conversations ,  http://publicconversations.org/about-us#sthash.BofRYBL1.dpuf  [dead link]  [3] Alison Baron and Mary Jacksteit. “Public Conversations Project Dialogue.”  Civicus , accessed January 30, 2019,  https://www.civicus.org/documents/toolkits/PGX_D_Public%20Conversations.pdf , 1  [4] “About us.”  Essential Partners,  accessed January 30, 2019,  https://www.whatisessential.org/about-us[5] Alison Baron and Mary Jacksteit. “Public Conversations Project Dialogue.”  Civicus , accessed January 30, 2019,  https://www.civicus.org/documents/toolkits/PGX_D_Public%20Conversations.pdf , 1.

They work to advance innovative and powerful ways for the public to engage in the democratic process and improve political discourse.  They work on in-depth and fair  deliberations , both in-person and online, in order to build meaningful new ways for the public to weigh in on the important issues.Origins and DevelopmentHealthy Democracy grew out of the successful work of their sister organization, Healthy Democracy Oregon, to promote an innovative reform of the ballot initiative process. This reform, called the  Citizens’ Initiative Review  (CIR), presents voters with clear, useful, and trustworthy evaluations of statewide ballot measures. Since 2009, Healthy Democracy has led efforts to develop and refine the  Citizens’ Initiative Review process for use by Oregon voters .  In June, 2011, the Oregon legislature approved House Bill 2634, legislation making the Citizens’ Initiative Review a permanent part of Oregon elections. Oregon is now the first state in the nation to adopt this innovative policy into law. This marked the first time a legislature has made voter deliberation a formalized part of the election process. The CIR is a benchmark in the initiative reform and public engagement fields.  House Bill 2634 also created a commission to oversee and conduct the Citizens’ Initiative Review (CIR) in Oregon. The CIR Commission is the official authority on how the CIR works, how it is administered, and what measures are selected for review. Healthy Democracy was selected by the newly formed Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review Commission to run two Reviews during the 2012 election cycle — the first official state CIRs.Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingKnow how this organization operates internally? Help uscomplete this section!Specializations, Methods and ToolsHealthy Democracy focuses on the  Citizens’ Initiative Review , a way of publicly evaluating ballot measures so that voters have clear, useful, and trustworthy information at election time.  During the Citizens’ Initiative Review, a panel of randomly-selected and demographically-balanced voters is brought together from across the state to fairly evaluate a ballot measure. The panel hears directly from advocates for and against the measure and calls upon policy experts during the multi-day public review. For each measure reviewed, a new panel is convened. At the conclusion of each review, panelists draft a ‘Citizens’ Statement’ highlighting the most important findings about the measure. Each ‘Citizens’ Statement’ is published as a prominent page in the voters’ pamphlet as a new and easily accessible resource for voters to use at election time.Major Projects and EventsThe CIR was adopted into Oregon Law during the 2011 session of the Oregon Legislature. Healthy Democracy worked on behalf of the Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review Commission to run two CIRs for the 2012 election cycle and planned to run two more in 2014.Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

 The Pew Center was an incubator for civic journalism experiments that enable news organizations to create and refine better ways of reporting the news to re-engage people in public life. It operated from 1993 to 2002. J-Lab, its successor project, archives its projects and publications, and maintains its website and its executive director, Jan Schaffer, now heads the Institute for Interactive Journalism. 
 The Pew Center for Civic Journalism's mission was to serve as ""an incubator for civic journalism experiments that enable news organizations to create and refine better ways of reporting the news to re-engage people in public life."" 
 Origins and Development 
 The Pew Center for Civic Journalism was established by The Pew Charitable Trusts to promote community involvement in local politics. 
 Organizational Structure and Funding 
 The governing structure, The Pew Charitable Trusts, was headquartered in Pennsylvania, and invested in various experiments of civic journalism. In the year 2000 alone, the Trusts awarded $230 million to 302 nonprofit organizations aimed to foster civic journalism. 
 Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 The Center assisted media outlets in finding new ways to report the news that will engage local communities and citizens in decision-making and problem resolution. 
 In addition to its many partnerships, The Center also conducted civic journalism experiments within the journalism community through workshops, publications, videos, and various outreach programs. The Pew Center shared the results of its experiments with the journalism professions through its: James K. Batten Awards for Excellence in Civic Journalism, Funding for Civic Journalism Projects, Workshops, Spotlights. Publications, Videos. Quarterly Civic Catalyst Newsletters, Presentations, and other outreach. According to the Pew Center's website, over 3,520 journalists have attended their workshops, 10,000 receive their quarterly newsletter, and 226 news organizations have participated in initiatives that were facilitated through the Center. Civic JournalismThe Pew Center for Civic Journalism strived to create media pieces that incorporate the public more in the information-gathering process. Civic Journalism makes an effort to portray how citizens view their social issues as well as what they think of as possible solutions. Journalists then utilize that information in creating a more personal, engaging broadcast or newspaper report. Civic Journalism is growing in popularity by many organizations. 
 Major Projects and Events 
 Significant partnerships in the past have included those with the Radio and Television news Directors Foundation, IRE, The Maynard Institute, NPR, PBS's Democracy Project, The Kettering Foundation, National Association of Black Journalists and the Association for Education in journalism and Mass Communications. The project is administered by The Tides Center of San Francisco. Civic Journalism ExperimentsThe Pew Center for Civic Journalism invested in various experiments in the field of journalism in hope of allowing organizations to express themselves in a non-traditional way, and therefore, involving the public in non-traditional journalistic ways. Since the organization was founded, the Center has assisted with over 120 initiatives that seek to provide the everyday citizen with a voice in how their news is covered. By doing this, the public is encouraged to share what they believe are problems, and then deliberate on solutions - making them more active citizens. 
 The Center supported projects concerning public engagement, quality of life, elections, race relations, crime, economy, youth/children, education, citizenship and governance. 
 One of their projects that received a significant amount of media attention as well as a notable increase in civil engagement is one called The Citizens Election Project. This project took place during the elections of 1995/1996 and consisted of over five media partnerships and focused on the ""crucial states:"" California, Iowa, New Hampshire and Florida. 
 Case studies of The Citizens Election Project included: ""Voice of the people, Iowa"" 
 Iowa: ""Students and the Caucuses"" 
 Derry, New Hampshire: ""The People's Voice"" 
 New Hampshire: ""Voters' Voice"" 
 San Francisco: ""Voice of the Voter"" 
 ""Voices of Florida""

Since then the organization has “supported well over 200 Citizen Deliberations around the country and more than 100 national and local PBS broadcasts.”Activities  By the People functions by using Deliberative Polling in which a random sample of citizens are surveyed on an issue before and after deliberative dialogue takes place, while simultaneously being covered by the media. The particular media that it is a part of is NewsHour, a program that is organized on by MacNeil/Lehrer Productions and distributed by Public Broadcasting Service (PBS).Funding  By the People is funded by W.K. Kellogg Foundation and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.Major Projects  Some of the major recent projects include:Hard Times, Hard Choices: Michigan Citizens DeliberateThis case study features a case organized by By the People in collaboration with the Center for Deliberative Democracy, allowing 317 Michigan citizens to participate in a deliberative poll in November 2009. The three day event eventually was turned into a NewsHour program broadcasted by PBS throughout Michigan in January 2010.

By planning special public events and online activities, the OPE enables citizens to communicate directly with the President’s Administration. There are three divisions of the OPE that makes this possible:  -Intergovernmental Affairs  -Community Relations and Engagement  -Protocol  The Intergovernmental Affairs division reaches out to a wide range of governmental offices- from state to component. They communicate with them directly in order to build and maintain positive relationships with various leaders (e.g. governors, mayors, etc.) and keep up-to-date with current events and issues.  The Community Relations and Engagement division offers collaborative opportunities for various organizations, advocacy groups, businesses and stakeholders. Customers, stakeholders, and employees may share their thoughts and receive feedback from upper-level officials from organizations they are associated with.  The protocol division is responsible for finding opportunities and upcoming events for the American public to engage in. This can range from outreach events to special occasions that involve the federal government.History  The Office of Public Engagement was introduced on  May 11, 2009  by President Barack Obama and the Whitehouse. Previously known as the Office of Community Liaison (OCL), President Obama believed that the OCL needed to be restructured and have a more suiting title. With a new, updated mission and name, the OPE offers and creates several new opportunities for the American public to engage in government events and discussions.  There are currently twenty members in the OPE. Three are in the leadership team, while the remaining seventeen are part of the staff. Valerie Jarrett, Christina Tchen, and Michael Strautmanis are the three members of the leadership team. Valerie Jarrett serves as the Senior Advisor and Assistant to the President. Christina Tchen is the Director, and Michael Strautmanis is the Chief of Staff to the Assistant to the President.  OPE’s staff members (and positions) are: Brian Bond (Deputy Director); Buffy Wicks (Deputy Director); Ashley Baia (Staff Assistant); Michael Blake (Deputy Associate Director); Danielle Borrin (Special Assistant); Anne Brewer (Executive Assistant); Kareem Dale (Special Assistant); Matthew Flavin (Assistant); Jodi Gillette (Associate Director); Joe Kennedy (Staff Assistant); Lisa Kohnke (Deputy Director); D. Paul Monteiro (Associate Director); Karen Richardson (Liaison); Susan S. Sher (Associate Counsel); Stephanie Valencia (Staff Assistant); David O. Washington, Ph.D. (Associate Director); and Jenny Yeager (Special Assistant).  When President Obama introduced the OPE, he also announced the publication of the  Citizen’s Briefing Handbook . This book served as the stepping point for public engagement and interaction with the OPE and federal government. In January 2009, Americans contributed to the publication of the Citizen’s Briefing Handbook by sharing their concerns, ideas, and potential solutions to current issues. The topics that were addressed in it dealt with: the US economy; education; energy and the environment; foreign policies; health care; homeland security; services; technology; and veterans.  The main requests that were mentioned in the handbook in regards to the topic of the US economy involved changes in taxation and employment. Americans wanted lower taxes, trade schools, and more jobs. In terms of education, US citizens strongly supported a change in sex education. Instead of abstinence-based education, they wanted sex education to be more “age appropriate.” Citizens also wanted students to gain more knowledge on eating healthier and the nutritional value of various foods. Additionally, they also wanted more attention drawn toward the arts, libraries, and science/engineering.  When it came to the energy and environment in the United States, citizens wanted their country to be more “green.” They were also supportive of additional public transportation systems, such as bullet rains and light rails. For foreign policy, they strongly encouraged the elimination of Torture facilities. Other issues regarding foreign policy concerned the aid to Israel, Cuba, the WHINSEC, and peace between Palestine and Israel. Under health care, the main issues addressed were: marijuana laws; health insurance companies; honoring terminally ill patients’ decision to pass. They also brought up the right each person has to having a healthy body, and funding for childhood care cancer.  In regards to homeland security, Americans argued against wars on abstract concepts and “don’t ask, don’t tell.” They also requested a legislation that would protect “whistle blowers,” a new decentralized energy grid, and an equal balance between US Security and Civil Liberties. Under service, they mentioned expanding Americorps, the idea of an e-library, expanding small business programs, and national service for college students.  The suggestions and input the US citizens had for technology were: legalizing online poker; restoring net neutrality protections; vote and deliberate on all bills on the Internet; create a suggestions/idea website for each state governor; and offer national WiFi. In regards to United States veterans, the main request was to entitle soldiers to their signing bonuses, regardless of whether they received an injury. Americans also mentioned their disapproval toward tour extensions, wanting to receive detailed explanations of their medical benefits upon their departure from the military, VA benefits, and VA Hospital Reform.Activities  The activities and events the OPE offer for the American public to participate in are:  -Teleconferences  -Collaboration Sessions  -Listening Sessions  -Information Sharing Sessions  -Webinars  -Stakeholder meetings  -Town Hall meetings  -Other special eventsFunding  The OPE is funded by the  United States federal governmentMajor Projects  Some of the major issues and projects the OPE have been working on are posted on their  blog . Lately, the topics the OPE have been focusing on have mainly involved employment, health care, and taxation. On March of 2010, the White House hosted a listening session for representatives from numerous non-profit, private, and public groups. They discussed financial and educational capability, and how many citizens today have limited resources that prevent them from obtaining a financially secure future. The White House and sectors heard directly from citizens that are experiencing this problem firsthand, and are currently working with the Financially Literacy and Education Commission (FLEC), Department of Treasury, and Department of Education to handle the issue. Recently, the Treasury and Department of Education issued an awards program that is aimed to further educate high school students on finances and their capabilities.  In addition to assisting citizens with limited resources, President Obama also has been responding to the public’s request for improved health care. On March 2010, after numerous OPE events, his  Health Reform  got approved, and he passed the  Affordable Care Act . The Health Reform guarantees health care for each American. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) entitles women and their children to affordable health treatment and coverage. They will have lower medical costs, insurance security, and good quality treatment. Insurance companies can no longer deny them coverage due to pre-existing health conditions, and women have more health insurance companies to select from while choosing a provider.  One of the many ways the OPE partake on the issue of taxes and the US economy is to plan meetings between the federal government and various organizations. These types of events typically involve the federal government informing organization leaders of recently approved bills, laws, measures, tax cuts, etc. For instance, in April 2010, the OPE held a meeting for under-represented organizations at the White House. They discussed a recently passed bill that will fund summer jobs, and a new measure that has provided tax cuts for companies that hire unemployed citizens.Secondary LitNewsbank: Office of Public Engagement set --new name, mission for White House liaison - Citizens'Briefing Book has ideas from Americans across the countryUS Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)""White House Office of Public Liaison""LinksOffice of Public Engagement (OPE)OPE Statement from White HouseCitizen's Briefing HandbookUnited StatesOPE BlogHeath Reform WebsiteAffordable Care Act  ",0,0,0,0,0,

The parliament serves to represent the views of diverse youth on government and services within the United Kingdom. It has been praised by a wide array of politicians and leaders including Nick Clegg and Gordon Brown. Brown has called the UK Youth Parliament “a symbol of the politics we should all strive for –politics that bring people together to work for what is best for us all.”History  In 1996, youth at the event “Heirs to the Millennium” protested to Andrew Rowe (the organizer) that there was a lack of youth voice in government. In response, Andrew along with the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), and youth worker, Kate Parish, began to create a proposal for the youth advocacy group. By 1998, a steering group had been formed and included predominately youth members and co-chairs approved by Andrew.  The UKYP launched in 1999 in the House of Commons and by 2000, Malcolm Wicks (Minister for Lifelong Learning in the Department of Education and Employment) decided to staff the project. In February 2001 UKYP had its first sitting in the House of Commons in London.Organizational Structure and Funding  Since the launch, this youth parliament has grown to over 600 elected Members of Youth Parliament (MYPs) and Deputy Members of Youth Parliament (DMYPs) which consist of men and women of diverse ethnic, social and economic backgrounds.  UK Youth Parliament elections occur every year and all youth ages 11 through 18 are eligible to vote in local elections. In 2008 there were 1,625 young candidates and over 565,802 of the United Kingdom’s youth voted in elections. Currently 90% of England’s education department called the Local Education Authorities holds the elections. The number of elected members is proportionate to the population of the region.  The administrative aspect of the parliament is overseen by the board of trustees which consists of half MYPs who are elected from their region every two years, and half stakeholders from various organizations including one representative of each major political party.  As a charity, the UKYP also receives funding from organizations such as the government’s Department for Children, Schools and Families, the Ministry of Justice Innovations Fund and the Children’s Workforce Development Council.  Currently, MWH (an engineering firm) is the official sponsor of the UKYP, while previously the parliament was sponsored by the telecommunication company, BT.Specializations and ActivitesPlease help us complete this section.Major Projects and Events  The UKYP holds three annual events including their Annual Sitting, Circles of Influence and debate in the House of Commons. In 2008 they also held a debate within the prestigious House of Lords.  The Annual Sitting is the largest UKYP event of the year and includes all the elected young members. This deliberative event takes place over three days on a university campus and features speakers from the British Parliament. At the Annual Sitting, the Members of Youth Parliament hold debates on seven areas: Culture, Media and Sport, Education and Employment, Empowering Young People, Health, International Matters, Law and Society, and Transport, Environment and Rural Affairs. During each Annual Sitting the MYPs create a manifesto which adequately represents the issues important to youth and includes policies centered on the seven areas of debate. Upon completion, the manifesto is passed on to the government to reflect current important issues of the United Kingdom’s youth.  Circles of Influence incorporates government and private organizations in a conversation with UKYP members. Two hundred members discuss important youth issues which in the past have included leadership and aptitude.  After much debate within the House of Commons chambers, the United Kingdom Youth Parliament was finally granted annual access to hold House of Commons in March 2010. The topics to be debated are decided in an online vote prior to the event. One of the issues discussed in 2009 was lowering the voting age to 16. UKYP member, James Evans, exclaimed “At 16, we can marry...have children...sign up in preparation for fighting and potentially die and suddenly we are not mature enough to vote. What an absolute disgrace!” In addition to lowering the voting age, the parliament discussed eliminating college tuition fees, reducing youth crime, providing free transportation to the elderly, and how to provide more job opportunities for young people.  On May 2, 2008, the UKYP held a debate among 300 members in the House of Lords. The House of Lords had only been used by a non-Parliament group once before. This historic event allowed members to debate for three hours and then vote on what campaigns to focus on for the upcoming year.CampaignsEach year the parliament holds a vote as to what the three most important campaigns or issues are for the nation. The campaigns of 2008 were targeted at lowering public transportation fees for youth, replacing university fees with a graduate tax and improving political education within the school systems.Secondary Sourceshttp://www.ukyouthparliament.org.uk/4655/index.html/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/youth/debtext/91030.htm#09110254000236http://www.jstor.org/pss/20003851http://74.125.155.132/scholar?q=cache:sqCLo3xRM6YJ:scholar.google.com/+uk+youth+parliament&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=100000000000000External Linkshttp://www.staffordshire.gov.uk/education/youth/speakout/ukparliament/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Youth_Parliamenthttp://www.facebook.com/pages/UK-Youth-Parliament/23643705952http://www.haveringyouth.co.uk/youth/ukyouthparliament/index.html  ",0,0,0,0,0,

PASOK is one of the two leading political parties in Greece and tends to be centre-left in ideology.Origins and DevelopmentPASOK was created in response to the collapse of the military dictatorship in Greece in 1974. Its founder, Andreas Papandreou, founded PASOK on the ideals of National Independence, Popular Sovereignty, Social Emancipation, and Democratic Process.  PASOK’s presence in Grecian government became prominent in its early years. By November 1977 elections, just three years after being established, PASOK had doubled its share of votes and won 92 seats, becoming the main opposition party. PASOK won 173 seats by 1981 and formed the first socialist government in Greece since 1924.  From 1985 – 1993 PASOK experienced extreme policy changes and financial and corruption scandals, which led to it’s brief decline in governmental influence. By 1995 Papandreou led PASOK to a landslide victory and regained control of the Grecian government.  In 1996 Papandreou was forced to step down due to his ailing health and was succeeded by Costas Simitis. Simitis started the pro-European wing of PASOK, and was accredited to modernizing PASOK. Yet, his lack of opinion and action of the Imia crisis caused him to have a flawed image by the Grecian people. In a time of Athens hosting the Olympics and terrorist attacks, PASOK lost its traditional appeal to the Greek lower and middle classes, resulting in a loss of elections in 2004. The New Democracy party had taken over from 2004 until 2009 when PASOK, now led by George Papandreou, finally regained election.IdeologyWhen founded PASOK was a social democratic party. Under Andreas Papandreou’s leadership, wages were increased and capital gains were taxed. When PASOK became under the power of Kostas Simitis there was significantly tighter fiscal policies, private state enterprises, and a broadening tax base. Shifting from its original principles, PASOK is now shifting the tax base, cutting salaries in both private and public sectors, and cutting social welfare. PASOK still defines their party as a social democracy.Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingSpecializations, Methods and ToolsMajor Projects and EventsAnalysis and Lessons LearnedPublicationsSee AlsoMarousi, Greece - Deliberative PollingReferences  ""Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK).""

The Common Enterprise has spent several years studying the various successes and failures of various fields—community building, community organizing, leadership development, politics, journalism, facilitation, government, the private sector, foundations, youth work —and then has analyzed this information to assist citizens and their communities to effectively work together . The Common Enterprise is community-building initiative funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. The Common Enterprise is currently working in –Tucson, San Antonio, San Diego and Portland to bridge the ideological gaps between citizens that prohibit them from reaching common goals within their local community. Although not a well-known organization, The Common Enterprise has worked within each of these four cities local educational institutions and their local non-profit organizations to support and assist them in effectively deliberating on local issues.Purpose and Problem  Often the importance of building relationships among citizens is overlooked by a community’s short-term goal of solving a specific issue; however, this shortsightedness is detrimental. Instead, encouraging productive relationships amongst a community’s citizens, allowing them to work together and apply their own strengths to an issue, builds an atmosphere in which a community can grow and productively interact. Thus building the long-term foundation that is necessary for a community to tackle current and future issues. Jaun Sepulveda explains, “Although there is always a specific community project to be addressed, the true value lies in recognizing that citizens are helping to create an atmosphere where getting to know one another and working together to tackle the community’s toughest issues become a way of life .” However, getting individuals that rarely interact together and creating a productive conversation is not an easy feat.  Common Enterprise’s purpose and mission is to facilitate such productive interactions and conversations between opposing parties and encourage each party to work collaboratively in their own community. The Common Enterprise strives to step back from situations and assess the factors that are “limiting to the ongoing community work of individuals and organizations across the country .” They then utilized this information to assist citizens and organizations to work past differences and successfully join together to better their community.History  The Common Enterprise initiative was formed in 1995. It was organized and funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. It is a national organization as it has studied various organizations around the United States; however, has four central sites from which it works—San Diego, Tucson, San Antonio and Portland.Research and Strategy  The Common Enterprise strives to understand the actions and processes that limit citizens and organizations from moving forward in their common endeavors. San Antonio’s previous site director, Juan Sepulveda, references Peter Senge, in his book, The Dance of Change, to explain why The Common Enterprise works to seek out these limiting processes. Senge explains, “We need to understand the nature of growth processes (forces that aid our efforts) and how to catalyze them. But we also need to understand the forces and challenges that impede progress, and to develop workable strategies for dealing with these challenges. ” The Common Enterprise specializes in understanding and then working to correct these limiting processes.  Previous site director for San Antonio, Jaun Sepulveda, explains the common limiting processes that The Common Enterprise recognizes, in his article, The Common Enterprise: A Report from San Antonio, Texas. Jaun Sepulveda highlights four major issues in this report. First Sepulveda explains that more citizens need to be involved. He states, “Almost every effort with which we have worked has had the same problem: there are never enough people to share the tasks and responsibilities necessary to carry out the work .” Sepulveda then explains this has two consequences; first, those individuals that are involved begin to complain about the workload and begin stereotyping the rest of the community as apathetic and lazy . Second, these volunteers start to believe that they are the only ones who can get the project done and do not seek outside help. As explained by John Gastil, in Political Communication and Deliberation, for productive deliberation it is necessary for a broad-spectrum of ideas to be brainstormed so that the best possible solution can be implemented. However, when only a select number of people are participating in the brainstorming process, the ideas presented will reflect those participating and often neglect to recognize the needs of other groups. The Common Enterprise recognizes that a completely representative group is impossible to create, however, “by focusing on who is not present, we can continue to develop strategies to attract others and offer them innovative ways of participating .” Furthermore, it is important the individuals do not claim to represent factions of the population in which they are not currently a part. Sepulveda explains individuals often do not recruit the minorities that are hard to interest such as, the poor, women and the youth; instead they claim that they can represent these individuals as they are “their neighbors” or “they use to be one of them.” Instead, it is more productive to recognize that these voices are not represented in ones organization and consider how these gaps can be appropriately filled. Furthermore, The Common Enterprise works with organizations to understand that participants should pursue tasks in which they are interested. Sepulveda explains, “When there are task forces to be led, subcommittees to be formed, or activities to be assigned and no one volunteers, usually the group stares at each other until someone feels guilty enough to volunteer. But the typical result is that it does not get done at all, or it gets done late or inadequately.” Therefore, the individual’s time was not productively spent. Instead, The Common Enterprise encourages organizations, as community builders, to seek out an individual that is passionate about the position and can effectively perform the task.  The second issue that The Common Enterprise has worked to assist community-building organizations with is to encourage individuals to stop creating an unmanageable workload. Sepulveda explains, “The group of people working on the added-on community work tries to fit the new set of activities into an already overburdened, unrealistic work schedule. Work hours are increased, but deadlines are missed, though in fact no one believed there was enough time to accomplish the goals. A silent agreement comes to pass: workers know they cannot complete their work, but they learn how to make it seem as if they are .” This is an unhealthy habit, which can result in individuals becoming so overwhelmed they give up trying to accomplish the objective. Therefore, the original goal is never completed. The Common Enterprise simply asks, “potential community volunteers to take a step back and evaluate everything they are already doing—professionally, personally, other volunteer commitments—before they make any commitments to a new project .” Therefore volunteers can enjoy the experience of successfully completing their goals; thus, empowering them to encourage other to be involved. Furthermore, the quality of work done will be visible to the public and encourage bystanders to be involved, as they can perceive that participation in such organizations can have productive results.  The third point that the Common Enterprise stresses the need for organizations to get back to basics. Sepulveda explains, “To have true community impact, an organization cannot forget the basics. Without the basics, there are no advanced issues to worry about because it will end up spending a great deal of its time reacting and trying to resolve the fundamental questions .” Therefore, before an organization moves on to complicated projects they must make sure they have their fundamental principles are clarified. As explained by Gastil in Political Commuication and Deliberation for a viable solution to be selected, a clear set of criteria must be decided on to assess the potential solution and its ability to meet the goals strived for by the committee.  The final point that the Common Enterprise seeks to implement is for citizens to “learn globally, act locally”. Sepulveda explains, “the...message we need to send is that community groups are not doing their job locally if they are not continuously learning from the efforts of others across the city, the country, and the rest of the world, and taking these resources and applying them to their local actions .” The Common Enterprise explains that it is important for organizations to look to other organizations to see how they have solved their problems; thus, allowing them to learn from each other. When organizations do not learn from each other Sepulveda explains, “the result is that many community efforts constantly reinvent the wheel, do not build on the successes and failures of the past, and believe that their local conditions are so unique that they must take on their tasks as though no one else has ever faced these sets of challenges .” The Common Enterprise has helped develop two different strategies to help citizens and organization to keep learning. The fist is coined the codification strategy—this strategy “focuses on capturing the knowledge, experiences, and lessons of individuals and groups that are working on basic, fundamental issues—the type of issues that many companies will face in their lifetime .” This information is then stored on databases which all members of the organization have easy access, therefore, eliminating the need for specific individuals to be sought out to answer questions. The second option The Common Enterprise has encouraged is the personalization approach, “Here, the focus is not on databases but on networks of individuals who can be tapped to tackle challenging problems creatively—problems that go beyond the basic issues faced by organizations.” Here Common Enterprise strives to have knowledgeable non-profit organizations utilize their knowledge of strategic consulting and help communities to learn and implement this knowledge.Major Projects and Events  The Common Enterprise works in four cities in the United States: San Diego, San Antonio, Portland and Tucson. However, The Common Enterprise has received the most recognition for its work in San Antonio and Portland.Portland: The Three Valley’s Project  The Three Valleys Project was a two-year project that was implemented by The Common Enterprise. The current project director is Sharif Abdulluh. It is now a direct grantee of the Rockefeller Foundation. The Three Valley Project worked to create an understanding and create community and civic engagement between citizens from different cultures that live in the three valleys. The Three Valleys Project focused on small towns located in the Hood River Valley, Mid-Willamette Valley and Tualatin Valley. The focus of this project was to assist in helping these communities interact with each other as they experience a large demographic change.  Three principal goals for the project :1: Moving Beyond Fear: Embracing A Multi-Cultural Reality  -Reducing racism, cultural antagonism and social isolation. -Building cultural diversity and sensitivity.2: Generating A Civic Dialog  -Facilitating the creation and expansion of a larger civic community. -Helping all of the people who live in a given area become full participate citizens of that area.3: Encouraging Systemic Change  -Addressing systemic and institutional problems challenging true multi-cultural citizenship in the Valleys. These goals were progressed toward through a series of roundtables in which facilitators and translators meet with citizens and worked with them to reach consensus and gain mutual respect for each other’s cultures. Thus The Common Enterprise strived to remove the limiting processes and helping these small communities build a solid foundation on which their community as a whole could grow.Funding  The Common Enterprise is a non-profit organization. The Common Enterprise has received funding from the Rockefeller Foundation.Publications  The Three Valley Project publishes a bilingual community newsletter that discusses the work that is being done to improve racial relations in the three valleys.Secondary Sources  1.)

The organization which is located in Washington D.C. supports democratic change and advocates for human rights. Furthermore, the Freedom House supports the growth of democracy by urging policy makers, international institutions, and governments worldwide to support human rights and democracy by adopting innovative policies that promote the advancement of progressive ideologies. These ideals are supported by their mission statement, which declares:  Freedom House, an independent nongovernmental organization, supports the expansion of freedom in the world. Freedom is possible only in democratic political systems in which the governments are accountable to their own people; the rule of law prevails; and freedoms of expression, association, and belief, as well as respect for the rights of minorities and women, are guaranteed. Freedom ultimately depends on the actions of committed and courageous men and women. We support nonviolent civic initiatives in societies where freedom is denied or under threat and we stand in opposition to ideas and forces that challenge the right of all people to be free. Freedom House functions as a catalyst for freedom, democracy and the rule of law through its analysis, advocacy and action.  The Freedom House is recognized worldwide as a source of defining the state of freedom around the globe; this is accomplished through its many publications. Freedom in the World is an annual report that assesses the state of political rights of 192 countries and 14 territories. The annual report is just one of the many publications that seek to bring to light the importance of current democratic and human rights worldwide. The organization combines the words advocacy, power, and action as core mission values for freedom worldwide.History  The Freedom House was established in 1941 with the support of President Franklin D. Roosevelt as a means of encouraging American involvement and support during World War II. Moreover, the foundation of the Freedom House can be accredited to the American fear of Nazism and the spread of Communism worldwide. During the early years, the board of trustees was made up of scholars from diverse backgrounds such as journalists, business and labor leaders, former governmental leaders, and academics. The variety of educational backgrounds along with abundances of differential experiences created bipartisanship within the organization. One of the earliest board members was that of Eleanor Roosevelt who, much like her husband, was a strong supporter of the Freedom House. The earliest members believed that the creation of the organization would be the best weapon to use to ensure the spread of Democracy and the elimination of totalitarianism and Communism; thus, the mission to ensure human rights across the globe and the values of Democracy became vital for the organization. Moreover, the Freedom House encouraged any pro-democratic institutions; following the war, the organization endorsed the Atlantic Alliance and NATO. The 1950s brought along an era of intensified fear of the spread of Communism and even more, the fear of being labeled a Communist. Not surprisingly, the Freedom House advocated against McCarthyism and remand on the pursuit of spreading democracy worldwide. At the same time, the organization continued its humanity efforts through being early supporters of the Civil Rights movement. In 1973, the Freedom House reached a milestone as it published its first edition of “Freedom in the World” which measured the level of freedom throughout the world on an annual basis. Today the Freedom House continues to serve as leading advocates for humanity with the progressive ideologies of democracy and remains a strong voice for foreign policy and global freedom.Specializations and Activities  Currently the Freedom House is actively pursuing their mission of democratic change worldwide. At this time, the organization is primarily focused on the following regions: Central Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. Some of the organizations activities include: promoting women rights in the Middle East and Northern Africa, conducting workshops on for the new Iraqi Constitution, and promoting freedom expansion worldwide. Moreover, the Freedom House is also leaders in an international exchange program. The international exchange programs are vital to the success of the organization because it allows for the process of establishing Freedom Houses across the globe and assists in the effort to expand freedom worldwide. The Freedom House offers three different kinds of exchange programs all of which focus on experiencing freedom and democracy. The Visiting Fellows Program offers participants from new and transitioning governments the chance to learn and understand how a democracy works. The Study Tour Program brings democratic together advocates, journalist, and public officials together to deliberate and discuss alternative views of government in an effort to gain an enhanced knowledge of democracy. Lastly, the International Executive Volunteer Program assists new democracies with hands on skill training. This is conducted through the technical assistance of the media, civic, and governmental and is guided by experienced professionals. The Freedom House is actively involved in global politics and is striving to be strong advocated for equality, freedom, and humanity worldwide.Funding  The Freedom House is a non-profit, nonpartisan organization that relies solely on individual donors worldwide. Donor support is critical in the effort to promote freedom globally. Individual donors can donate online or send donations to Freedom House headquarters in Washington D.C. All donations are tax-deductible. In 2007, the organizations total net assets added up to $8.21 million. A few of the donors that contributed at least $250,000 include The Australian Agency for International Development, Government of the Netherlands, and the U.S. Department of State.Publications  The Freedom House distributes numerous publications annually with the most prominent survey being the “Freedom in the World” which is a comparative assessment of global politics and civil liberties. Beginning in 1972, “Freedom in the World” assesses the degree of freedom in 193 countries and 14 territories worldwide. Each country is ranked as free, partially free, or not free; each country is surveyed by numerous political scientists. Furthermore, each country is ranked numerically on a 1-7 scale with 1 being most free and 7 being least free. In order for a country to be classified as free it must receive a score from 1-2.5, partially free 3-5, and not free 5.5-7. The survey is used worldwide as a reference for policy making, the media, international corporations, civic activists, and human rights leaders.  Global Trends  Since the survey began in 1972, the overall trend has been that a higher percentage of countries are becoming more free and throughout the years, many countries have transformed from “not free” to being classified as a “free.” In 1976 only 26% of all countries were free and 43% were labeled as not free. However, in 2008, the Freedom House reported that there had been a decline in freedom worldwide. One concern for the decline is because of the political disturbances and democratic regression in the following countries: Russia, Pakistan, Kenya, Egypt, Nigeria and Venezuela. A significant portion of countries in Asia also had setbacks in 2008 according to the Freedom House. Due to increased restrictions on civil society and increased military activity Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka have all regressed on their pursue for total freedom. Thailand, on the other hand actually progressed on the freedom scale; because of national election, Thailand transformed from “not free” in 2007 to “partially free” in 2008.  Beginning in 1980, the Freedom House began to survey the “Freedom of the Press” which is dedicated to ensuring freedom of the media in the world. According to organization, “a free press plays a key role in sustaining and monitoring a healthy democracy, as well as in contributing to greater accountability, good government, and economic development.” Much like “Freedom in the World” each country is ranked on the same scale; free, partially free, or not free. The survey includes print, broadcast, and the internet when measuring the degree of freedom. In the most recent publication of the 195 countries ranked, 37% were deemed free, 59% partially free, and 64% were rated as not free. Other prominent Freedom House publication include, “Nations in Transit”, “Countries at the Crossroads”, “Women’s Rights Survey”, and “Freedom on the Net.”Major Projects  The Freedom House is committed to ensuring the spread of democracy and freedom worldwide. In an effort to accomplish this mission, the organization’s leaders are strong global advocates. Organization leaders are constantly working with democratic reformers in many countries as they strive to transform the country’s government. The organization has currently begun a deliberative program started in May 2010, called the Debate Program which is “dedicated to promoting discussion on human rights and democracy issues in Latin America” according to the Freedom House website. Since the organizations foundation in 1941, a major issue has been to spark debate on global democracy and human rights. Another prominent program that kicked off in May 2010 is aimed to support media freedom in Uganda. The country is currently approaching presidential elections and as a result the Uganda government has proposed an amendment to silence the media. The bill would significantly limit the freedom of speech within the country. As a result, Freedom House Courtney Radsch gave a presentation on freedom of speech in the country with a hope that the country will loosen media restrictions. The organization plans to continue the efforts throughout the 2010 summer.Secondary Sources  ""Crying for freedomEconomist 394. 8665  http://web.ebscohost.com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/ehost/detail?vid=5&amp;hid=107&amp;sid=4a4e86f1-ea13-4d0c-8152-8e31e02781b1%40sessionmgr10&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&amp;AN=47607013#db=a9h&amp;AN=47607013 .

Democracy doesn’t just stop after a general election. It’s everywhere, every day.  The problem was that citizens either didn’t know how to access it, or had to jump through so many hoops to take part that it just wasn’t worth their time. Delib looks at democratic processes that aren’t functioning properly, and design digital products that make them work for an internet age.  Delib's products are in use by over 160 organisations around the world, primarily concentrated in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. [1]Origins and DevelopmentSince its inception in 2001, this firm has been one of the top digital democracy companies in the field. Throughout their existence, their clientele has included central governments such as that of the United Kingdom and the United States of America, as well as central government departments, local authorities of varying size and scope, health bodies, regulators, and other publicly accountable bodies.[2]Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingDelib is a for-profit company that offers its products on an annual subscription basis. Organisations can choose to use one, two or all three, depending on their individual needs and plans for citizen engagement. As such there is no membership available.  Delib is a small company with about 30 employees. Its HQ is located in Bristol, England, but it also has staff in Australia, New Zealand, and Scotland.FundingThis organization is a for-profit company and they work with various organizations and governments. The cost of each tool is charged annually on a subscription basis. Some examples of partners they have worked with and for include:NHS, BBC Trust, Defra, European Parliament, NAPA, DoH, Cabinet Office, Bristol City Council, London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority, London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, and the Scottish Government.  ToolsCitizen Space:Citizen Space is a democratic involvement platform that is most commonly used for statutory and non-statutory consultation and stakeholder engagement. It supports the end-to-end process of public involvement: from the design and creation of the response mechanism through data collection to final feedback and response publishing.  This online consultation platform has been  used by the Scottish Government .Simulator:This product makes it easier for people to understand complex decisions, such as budgets, policing priorities and climate obligations, enabling informed opinions on the issue in question. Simulator allows weighted resource allocation and priority-setting that begins to reproduce the conditions government officials face in their own decision-making. The tool informs at the point of response, meaning that participants need no prior knowledge of e.g. council finances to take part. [3]Dialogue:This product allows for the sharing of ideas,  online  dynamic interaction and the gathering of customer feedback. It is ideal for  crowd-sourcing ; promoting innovation and ideas exchange; and running debates on issues that your community cares about. This application has been used by the White House and the Department of Homeland Security to get people involved in important discussions. [4]Major Projects and EventsCase Studies  Delib is dedicated to helping their clients excel in their efforts of engaging with the public. Through previous case studies, Delib has been successful in developing consultations that connect government departments and local organizations with regular citizens. Delib has developed a strategy for their case studies which consists of the brief, the work, the results and finally, how to find out more information.1. Barnet, Enfield and Haringey PCTSThey have worked with Barnet, Enfield and Haringey PCTS, which are three hospitals that are interested in providing better qualified local doctors and better building for their patients to enjoy. BE&amp;H is interested in engaging and consulting local citizens about health care issues that are most sensitive. Delib managed a bespoke  e-consultation  campaign which received a lot of community engagement. The number of participants reached over 10,000 and hundreds of responses to the  surveys  conducted.2. Macmillan Cancer Support CenterWith the use of an 'Idea Tree,' Delib was able to manage a successful campaign with MCSC. Macmillan cancer support center is dedicated to helping people whose lives have been affected by cancer. They wanted to build engagement and research how people think cancer should look like in 2016. They developed an idea tree which helped people read, rate, and submit ideas for improving the ordeal involved with cancer. Essentially an effort to push for better cancer care for patients and their families, the number of participants reached over 26,000 and the submitting of more than 250 ideas.[7]3. Torbay CouncilOne of the other case studies was with Torbay Council which is Unitary Authority[8]; their goal was to allow Torbay citizens to be involved in the budget setting process and make their priorities known to council decision-makers. Delib created a budget simulator that is a customizable tool to help with consultation and prioritizing local issues. Responses were numbered in more than 1,000 Torbayian residents.4. DefraThe Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs is a government department in the UK. [9] Their desired results were to “ Raise awareness and encourage attitudinal change amongst 11-16 year olds about the urgent need to tackle climate change.” Delib helped them by building “my adobo” which is an online tool that helps people shape a house to suit them, when they are done, they can shape the climate. Over 138,000 visited the site to see the impacts of customizable virtual houses and their effects on the climate. This resulted in over 32,000 adobos being created.5. National Dialogue on Health Care, IT and Privacy for the National Academy of Public AdministrationThey were interested in hearing about ideas and opinions of stakeholders as well as Americans on the issue of healthcare. With help from Delib, they were able to develop an 'opinion tracker' which is an online database that allows people to share their intelligent thoughts while others are able to listen and make-sense of the thousands of voices all going on at once. The results were outstanding because the opinion tracker received over 2800 visitors a week and submitted over 120 unique ideas and more than 500 comments on those ideas.6. London Borough of Hammersmith and FulhamThe final case study was for London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. They are a council that is dedicated to helping residents and businesses during rough times.[10] LBHF wanted to deliver “deliver a full online consultation and stakeholder/public engagement web system to support the authority's consultation work.” The customized version of Delib’s e-consultation platform was the tool LBHF was most interested in. This online database includes a finder database, survey tool, stakeholder communication system, and reporting and management tools. This was a huge success because everyone had an opportunity to engage in discussions. In the end, more than 2,000 residents responded to online surveys.Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

Craig and is a non-profit organization who's headquarters are in Keystone, Colorado with other offices in Denver and Washington, DC. The main purpose of the Keystone Center is to seek ways to solve our society's most demanding environment, energy and public health problems. The Center looks to bring together today's public, private and civic sector leaders to address these issues and also to equip the next generation with knowledge and the social skills required to effectively take on questions they will face in the future.  The Keystone Center specializes in helping community, government, and business leaders acquire the scientific, social, economic, and political information they need to make sound decisions. More specifically, The Keystone Center helps the public, private, and civic sectors use scientific knowledge and state-of-the-art consensus-building in the areas of environmental, health, and energy policy. We accomplish this through independent facilitation and mediation services on a range of significant policy issues.  http://keystone.org/files/file/about/Statement_of_Independence.pdf .  The Center for Science and Public Policy is one of two Centers that Keystone contains. This center has been aiding public, private, and civic-sector leaders solve difficult issues and achieve quality public policy since 1975. Center for Science and Public Policy relies on their independence, commitment to ample science, and skills in designing and leading consensus-building procedures to create new partnerships, diminish conflict and create policy agreements. Energy, Environment and Health and Social Policy are the three areas of policy this center specializes in. The center works on a range of issues on energy, which include; climate change and clean energy; electricity generation and markets; energy infrastructure; energy planning; renewable energy and energy efficiency; and transportation. In addition to individually-funded projects, the Keystone Center hosts the Keystone Energy Board. This board is a long standing forum for representatives across the energy spectrum to learn about and debate on energy issues most citizens' face today. Each of the meetings brings together experts and knowledgeable leaders in the field and showcases confidential deliberation that usually lead to new Keystone Dialogues and membership into this board is by invitation only.  Environment is the Keystone Center's second area of policy, which can range from local to international; from two parties with a single issue to complex deliberation involving multiple parties over multiple issues. In each of these cases the center uses its neutral and independent facilitation in helping people solve issues and make knowledgeable decisions. They serve as a trusted bridge between those with a wide range of perspectives on a large array of environmental policy, legislative, and regulatory questions, including: collaborative resource management; ecosystem and watershed management; natural resource protection; water quality and quantity issues; sustainable agriculture; green marketing; transportation; climate change; restoration and remediation; and resource extraction and use (mining, forestry, and sustainable development).  The third area is Health and Social Policy where the center works with a wide range of stakeholders to create consensus solutions to intricate health and social policy challenges. They design, amass and facilitate nation policy dialogues, stakeholder advisory boards, fact-finding, and peer-exchange forums, public-input processes, coalition-building processes, conflict assessments, and training workshops. A short list of client organizations includes: the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention, the Asian Development Bank, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Richard Lounsbery Foundation, DuPont, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The Keystone Center also works on policy problems in the areas of: medicine; health care; food and nutrition; workplace safety and health; environmental health; and chronic and infectious diseases.  Center for Education is the second part of the Keystone Center. At this center, they work with students, teachers, and communities to stimulate critical thinking through physical touch and scientific questioning. The center is committed to increasing awareness and understanding of the real world and to provide students of all ages and abilities with the best skills needed to investigate and solve problems.Specializations and Activities  The Center for Science and Public Policy offers the following customized services: The Keystone Dialogues, which identify policy questions ready for deliberation, then frame the questions, bring the stakeholders together, and then finally help them build a consensus that will lead to real results. The dialogues are carefully created deliberative meetings that address politically controversial and technically complex parts of an issue being examined. The policy dialogue seeks to exchange information and build consensus recommendations between public, private, and civic sector thought leaders who are in a position to create alliances, make decisions, or strongly influence the trajectory of a possible challenging issue. These dialogues bring unique interest groups to the table, focus on regulatory, policy, or planning issue that is on popular interest, are usually guided by a facilitator or mediator, have a life cycle with a beginning, middle and end, and seek to formulate practical solutions to difficult problems.  Facilitation and mediation is another customized service offered, which brings parties together to find the answers to problems, reach agreements, make plans and resolve conflicts. The mediators of the Keystone Center are among the most knowledgeable and experienced in public policy conflict resolution and consensus building. The staff has convened and facilitated important agreement-focused dialogues, helping government leaders bring stakeholders together to solve difficult and controversial healthcare, energy and environment problems. The center has facilitated national policymaking processes, statewide consensus-building efforts and local decision-making discussions.  Public participation and stakeholder engagement is designing and executing public meetings to gather input, share information or announce agency choices. The public expects to hear from government officials before, during and after and agency makes a large and important decision. The Keystone Center's facilitators have designed and delivered public engagement processes that increase the quality of public policy, give officials access to information from the members of the public, give the public vital information about the purpose for government action and allow for careful consideration of other options. They can turn a potentially negative public meeting into thoughtful venues for dialogue and deliberation. The center has helped the local government reach other to its community members and federal agencies. In the process the center has improved communication, subdued fears, corrected misunderstandings, sorted out issues of community values and set the stage for agencies to create plausible solutions.Major Projects and Events  Under the Center for Education are the Keystone Educational Excellence Programs, which mold education communities around the world with the development and dissemination of on-biased, hands-on, interdisciplinary curriculum. With the support from public, private and corporate partners, the center works with educators to improve the education of science and instill in today's students a better understanding of the real work and equipped with the tools needed to solve future complex problems.  The Keystone Science School is a residential field science school that challenges students to develop critical thinking skills as they explore nature and science education. making extensive use of the outdoor laboratory around us, the center promotes inquiry and sensitivity to the natural environment.  The center understands that today's youth are this countries future leaders, the ones who will develop policies and make decisions that impact our world. The center has created interactive science education programs that help the students become familiar with scientific and critical thinking skills and promote them to be engaged citizens.  Between November 2005 and June 2007, a team from The Keystone Center helped to organize and put into action a multiparty negotiation that aimed to increase redress for people affected by river contamination from the Ok Tedi Mine in Papua New Guinea. This river is said to be the worst man-made environment problems in the world and is a true sustainability problem. After an 18 month period of efforts, a major accomplishment was reached.  Delegates from the nine affected regions surrounding the river, the mining company, the government, and others concluded a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) that will eventually give the people in the affected area about 1.1 billion kina (about $350 million US) in funds, projects and services.Funding  The Keystone Center receives 49.4% of its funding from fees/ earned income; this is the largest percentage of its funding. 38.9% of its funding comes from corporate supporters; 5.7% from events held to raise funds for the center; 4.7% from foundations; .8% from individual pockets; .3% is government funded; and .2% is interest/ miscellaneous income.External Linkshttp://keystone.org/homehttp://www.keystone.org/science-public-policyhttp://www.keystone.org/educationhttp://keystone.org/files/file/about/annual-report/KeystoneCenter-2008-annual-E-EDITION.pdfhttp://www.thataway.org/?p=982  ",0,0,0,0,0,

By elevating a diversity of voices, forging common ground, and improving dialogue and collaboration among leaders and communities, Public Agenda fuels progress on critical issues, including education, health care and community engagement. Founded in 1975, Public Agenda is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization based in New York City.  Origins and Development  Public Agenda was founded in 1975 by social scientist and author, Daniel Yankelovich, and United States Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance. For over 35 years, Public Agenda has aimed to fulfill two main missions: for American leaders to better understand the public's point of view, and for citizens to know more about critical policy issues so they can make thoughtful, informed decisions.  PublicAgenda.org has been nominated twice for the prestigious Webby Award as one of the Internet's best sources for balanced, accurate information on public policy issues. It has participated with many different communities and partnered with many organizations to better inform the nation, so citizens and leaders can make higher quality decisions on public issues.  Organizational Structure and Funding  Public Agenda is funded by multiple major organizations. Some grants are designated for specific projects.Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation - Promotes greater equity in global health, education, public libraries, and support for at-risk families in Washington State and Oregon  Carnegie Corporation of New York - Created by Andrew Carnegie in 1911 to promote ""the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and understanding.""

Research that illuminates people's views and valuesPublic Agenda conducts nuanced and in-depth opinion research, based on co-founder Dan Yankelovich's Learning Curve perspective. This research enables the organization to understand where stakeholders are coming from, what they think and why. In turn, it helps leaders and stakeholders grasp:how others are thinking and talking about a problem  the sorts of solutions they are currently willing to support  how to effectively engage them in problem solving2. Engagement that gets people talking, learning from each other and working together on solutions.Public Agenda's engagement work is propelled by their research and based on decades practice. Through careful issue framing, nonpartisan Choicework discussion guides, well-designed dialogue, expert facilitation and skillful reporting, Public Agenda helps people build common ground, despite their differences.  The organization's Community Conversation model for public engagement offers an alternative to traditional and often unproductive public forums. Community Conversations provide government officials and community leaders an opportunity to engage a broad cross section of a community in productive, action-oriented deliberation.3. Techniques for managing the human side of change.Often, earnest attempts to make a good decision and solve a problem are derailed when it comes time to make necessary changes. Change is always bumpy, but Public Agenda helps improve the implementation and sustainability of reform through additional research and engagement techniques that address the human side of change.4. A capacity building ethos.Public Agenda strengthens the capacity of community members, organizational and institutional leaders, and other stakeholders to continue and expand the work they do. Public Agenda works closely with stakeholders to develop tailored and flexible tools, provide training and assistance, and share knowledge of lessons learned.5. Communications that build momentum for change.Through approachable and readable reports, regular commentary, social media, and presentations, podcasts and webinars, Public Agenda shares what they're doing and learning to help others across the nation and worldwide work together toward solutions.  Major Projects and Events  Public Agenda is associated with many different public engagement projects and community forums to help the nation’s citizens come together to better deliberate and collaborate on difficult issues.  One of the projects was the Citizen Engagement And Community Transformation in Bridgeport, CT. In 1996, the Bridgeport Public Education Fund (BPEF) joined a national demonstration project led by Public Agenda and the Institute for Educational Leadership (IEL) to explore possibilities for public dialogue about education reform among diverse stakeholders.  In the spring of 2004, Public Agenda participated in the Nebraskans Weigh in on Essential Educational Opportunities for All Students. The Nebraska State Board of Education was looking for a way to allow a cross-section of residents to weigh in on the recommendations they had developed and laid out in a document called Equitable Opportunities For an Essential Education For All Students-Recommendations for Nebraska Public School Districts.Public Agenda had helped the state board connected hundreds of Nebraskans to discuss the controversial question of statewide standards. Parents, students, educators and community members participated in Choicework discussion forums where they wrestled with various approaches to the standards issue. Building off the results of these discussions, the state board was able to adopt new statewide guidelines. In the end, Public Agenda conducted focus groups and helped selected districts facilitate discussion forums with more than 370 parents, students, educators (teachers, principals and superintendents) and members of the general public that represented roughly 25 districts.  In 2004, Public Agenda conducted fieldwork in New Haven, Connecticut; San Antonio, Texas; and New York City, which was support from the Annie E. Casey Foundation and the New York Community Trust. This project was called the Straight Talk/Street Talk: Possibilities for Dialogue Between Communities and the Police. They interviewed numerous law enforcement officials, from patrol officers to upper brass, and held 12 focus groups with various kinds of residents. They also developed four new Choicework guides (Preventing Crime, Promoting Public Safety; Improving Police-Community Relations; Ensuring School Safety and Preventing Terrorism and Protecting Civil Liberties) that were used to structure five dialogue sessions held across the three sites.  In September 2003 Public Agenda launched the project of Addressing Property Tax Reform in New Jersey. Public Agenda helped the Coalition for the Public Good, a New Jersey based grass-roots organization, to organize and conducted a major statewide ""Citizen's Tax Assembly,"" a two-day event held in the capitol building in Trenton.  The New Jersey Citizens' Tax Assembly  brought together close to 100 diverse ""delegates"" from every county in the state to engage one another in a dialogue on possible approaches to tax reform.  Public Agenda helped in creating a different kind of forum in which residents from across the state could engage complex questions of tax reform and reveal that reasonable solutions are possible. Public Agenda carried out focus groups with Anglo parents, bilingual Hispanic parents, Spanish-only Hispanic parents, students of various backgrounds, and teachers on the topics of student achievement, diversity, and equity, for the Standards in San Jose, California project. One district official called the findings ""an eye-opening experience"" because parents of all backgrounds, along with students themselves, called for high expectations for student achievement. In response, the school board raised its graduation requirements. The district then moved on to a broad-based community conversation about ""Standards and Expectations for Our Students"" with Public Agenda assisting by training conversation organizers and moderators, and by developing discussion materials. Although the district initiated and sponsored the forum, a committee that included parents, members of the clergy, employers and others took over the planning and operations. The forum, held at a downtown church, drew about 140 participants; some discussions were conducted in Spanish with translated materials and a bilingual moderator and recorder. The National School Public Relations Association awarded the district a top award for its public engagement model.  In the 1990's research commissioned by the Graustein Memorial Fund in Connecticut and conducted by Public Agenda revealed significant gaps between the general public, community leaders and educators concerning the problems facing Connecticut's schools, which resulted to the Changing the Conversation on Education in Connecticut project. To kick off the project, hundreds of organizations--school districts, parent groups, community-based organizations, etc., were invited to participate. Initially, eight local sponsors were chosen, covering 17 towns. By design, they were to work as a network to build statewide capacity for civic dialogues on the range of issues facing Connecticut's schools. Each site was funded and received technical assistance from Public Agenda. Since then, over 70 cities and towns across the state have participated and the initiative continues to grow.

As an independent mediation group, the HD Centre is based in Geneva, Switzerland and is dedicated to helping improve responses from global actors in cases of armed conflict. During the mediation process, this NGO operates as a third-party mediator and maintains a constant stance of neutrality, while being funded by outside parties, such as governments, foundations and passionate philanthropists.Purpose and Mission  With so many conflicts existing in the world, the HD Centre focuses solely upon conflicts that—while acting in accordance with international law—have strong prospects in long lasting peace. While acting alongside formal global diplomacy, the HD Centre believes that the efforts of a private foundation—whose aim is to create dialogue based on the foundations of humanitarian principles—can contribute to the international goal of establishing effective peace-making mediations.History  In 1999, the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue was created and registered as a Swiss Foundation. The HD Centre asserts that they are:  “An independent and impartial organization whose motivation is to reduce human suffering in war. We believe preventing and resolving armed conflicts is the surest means of doing so.”  Initially, the organization strived to create innovative approaches to dealing with international conflict. The goal was to create a forum where the centre could promote and facilitate conversation in a deliberative manner between the leaders of opposing parties in international conflicts.Activities  The HD Centre pursues their objectives through various activities. It is important to recognize that this organization continues to operate and grow through the efforts of global actors. The organization is committed to working and collaborating with those who live across borders and with those who maintain different beliefs and professions. Furthermore, looking at different and new approaches to the mediation process is vital to the success of the HD Centre. Activities within the organization are defined by the facilitation of dialogue between conflicting parties in the global arena, and acting as a third-party mediator when appropriate. Also, they strive to ensure that all parties within the negotiation process have the opportunity to effectively participate and contribute to the dialogue, to mobilize (when necessary) humanitarian, diplomatic and/or political responses, and to offer policy-based contributions on applicable issues.Funding for the HD Centre  The importance of conflict resolution and the need for mediated dialogue between conflicting global actors is crucial for the prosperity of world peace. Funding for the HD Centre comes from the contribution of all forms of actors, including countries, cities, private foundations and individuals. Donors include the countries of Norway, Sweden, the UK, Switzerland, Denmark, Ireland, Australia, the Netherlands, the City of Geneva and the MacArthur foundation.Major Pojects  Before becoming involved in the mediation process between two warring parties, the HD Centre will assess the situation to make sure that their efforts will be effective in a long-lasting peaceful resolution. Also, before the initial assessment is executed, the organization requires an invitation or recommendation from individuals, organizations or governments in order to get involved in specific conflicts. Upon the completion of these two steps, the HD Centre will engage in mediation (as to ensure effective deliberation) in hopes of reducing the consequences of conflict and to come up with a peaceful resolution. Such projects include conflicts in Sudan, Philippines (NDF), Myanmar/Burma, the Central African Republic, Timor-Leste, Kenya and Somalia.Publications  Davis, Mike, ed.

Purpose and Mission of the Annenberg Institute for School Reform:  The purpose and mission of the Annenberg Institute for School Reform is to challenge to the nation to improve public education in America by enhancing the quality of learning for youth in urban communities across the country.  II. History of the AISR:  In 1993, Brown University of Providence, Rhode Island received an anonymous gift of five million dollars. This is significant for two reasons: one, who in the world gives a five million dollar gift anonymously and where can I find friends like these? And two, this is what funded the take-off for the Annenberg Institute for School Reform project. [1] The first director of the Institute, Dr. Theodore R. Sizer, had previously founded and been chairman of the Coalition of Essential Schools. The Coalition of Essential Schools (CES) forefronts the movement to create and sustain personalized and intellectually-challenging schools [6]. The CES specializes in supporting student achievement and promoting innovative teaching styles. Dr. Sizer built upon this idea with an even broader mission: “to support sustained, focused efforts to enhance the quality of learning of children and youth across the country.” Later, following the retirement of Dr. Sizer in October of 1998, a new executive director was appointed: the then-director of the Philadelphia Education Fund, Dr. Warren Simmons. It was during this time that the AISR adopted the mission statement that it currently acts under to date, with an emphasis on concentrating critical needs to improving public schools in the urban communities of our country.  a. The Challenge: A few months after the birth of “The Institute” as it is appears to be lovingly nicknamed, another donor felt particularly generous and decided to contribute an additional fifty million dollar gift. This was a part of Ambassador Walter H. Annenberg’s 500-million dollar “Challenge to the Nation,” which was to improve education in America. The “Challenge to the Nation” is the largest public/private undertaking solely dedicated to improving public schools in the history of the United States. Over 35 states have adopted “Challenge” projects focused on serving students and teachers through the funds of private donations from contributors such as businesses, universities, foundations, and various individuals. [2] Each of the “Challenge” projects has to fit within the unique conditions of its local site. The directors are able to ensure that this happens through conducting local planning groups made up of education staff, business leaders, foundation officers, and other community members. These governing boards were given the responsibility and privilege of running the projects. In order to fully understand the Annenberg Institute for School Reform project (AISR), it is important to know the background of the “Challenge.” The “Challenge” is responsible for awarding millions of dollars worth of grants to subprojects such as the AISR, with fifty-million donated so far. In a sense, the “Challenge” is the “big picture” that is hoped to be achieved through secondary organizations much like the AISR.  b. Influential Founder: Aside from knowing about the “Challenge,” it is also necessary to mention the man who made the whole cause possible, founder Walter H. Annenberg. Annenberg was born in March of 1908 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to lower-class Prussian immigrants. His parents eventually became millionaires from publishing controversial periodicals such as the Philadelphia Inquirer, Daily Racing Form, and the Morning Telegraph. He served as US Ambassador to Britain for five years, from 1969 to 1974 [5]. After his father died, Annenberg inherited the family’s Triangle Publications, Inc. and decided to take the trio in a different direction. He used this platform to successfully found Seventeen Magazine in 1944 as well as develop the TV Guide, and own several broadcast TV and stations. After proposing and donating 500-million dollars to the “Challenge” as well as donating an additional 365 million to various prep schools and universities, it is no surprise that Annenberg was considered one of the largest philanthropists to education in his time, earning numerous prestigious honors and awards. In appreciation of all of the generous gifts Annenberg gave in support of the AISR, the Institute was renamed in his honor after his death in 2002 at age 94.  III. Project:  For public engagement, the AISR has created television programs that are designed to link together large groups, sometimes of several hundred people [7]. In 1999, a video workshop put on by the AISR was offered for K-12 teachers, administrators, and parents in order to discuss critical issues in school reform. The AISR has provided eight different video programs that run from about 30-56 minutes long, a workshop guide, as well as a website [8]. Through these media resources, individuals are able to see first-hand how schools and their communities are talking and deliberating about school reform. The primary focus is turning this talk into action by adapting, implementing, and even inventing new tools in order to make actual improvements in student achievement. From the comfort of one’s own home, the workshop takes viewers to eight different places across the country, showing teachers, parents, administrators, civic leaders, and other representatives collaborating on innovative practices in regards to “public engagement and professional development.” The eight different locations include schools in Boston, Missouri, Baltimore, Pasadena, New Hampshire, Virginia, San Bruno, and Massachusetts.  The topics are just as diverse as the variety of locations. Deliberative conversations center on topics from school subjects such as math and science, to other learning factors, like teaching styles, educational challenges, and family cooperation. Each video goes about investigating and discussing these themes in a different way. For example, the teachers at a high school in Pasadena, California do so by using a peer-observation process where the teachers observe one another in their respective classrooms, and then meet both individually and in groups in order to offer their feedback. This results in ways to improve the relation between teaching practice and student achievement. At an elementary school in Boston, teachers and staff aim to enhance student success through close collaboration with the families of students. A Massachusetts school does it differently still: teachers share sample works of her students with a group of teachers , administrators, and parents in a facilitated “consultancy” that focuses on a specific question posed by the teacher about both student work and her own teaching style.  IV. Funding:  As a parent organization of numerous institutes, the “Challenge” is known for offering funds to many of the groups that it has helped create. The Annenberg Institute for School Reform was actually the first recipient of monetary funds from the Annenberg Challenge. At a 50-million dollar price tag, these funds were delegated as an operating and endowment grant. The two organizations were involved in setting guidelines and designing parameters that would dictate how much would go toward Challenge grants at local sites, and how much would go toward evaluating the nationwide efforts of the Challenge. The AISR itself does not play a role in selecting grant recipients, or of allocating the funds. This is the sole responsibility of the overall Annenberg Foundation. The Foundation is in charge of handling all funds and delegating where they go for every project that it oversees. The individual organizations focus exclusively on their missions of improving conditions and outcomes in American schools and education. [3] Different projects and activities put on by the AISR are made possible through the donations of many important funders. These include the likes of certain organizations, programs, schools and universities, as well as private citizens. Some of the biggest donors are the Academy for Educational Development (AED), Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Collaborative Communications Group (CCG), the Community Involvement Program at New York University, and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.V. Activities  As a part of the AISR’s ongoing mission to improve public education for American youth, there are plenty of reoccurring activities dedicated to meeting this goal. The AISR aims to inspire “community organizing and engagement” by bringing together citizens from all walks of life: parents, students of all ages, civic officials, businesses, community agencies, cultural institutions, and ordinary average Joe’s to name a few. They then build an understanding within these groups of educational issues in order to advocate for and participate in school-improvement issues. They do this via a few different projects. One of the biggest is the National League of Cities (NLC) Public Engagement Partnership project. With this, the AISR conducted national surveys for promising public engagement strategies in urban settings in order to find what worked best. This review paired the input of the public with an ongoing association of the Education Policy Advisors Network (EPAN) in order to help provide city officials with tools and resources they would need to prepare case studies. This includes developing new tools for civic engagement and utilizes site-based technical support.  Another large activity that is currently going on is the Schools for a New Society Initiative (SNS). This was created in the year 2000 where different districts received funding to restructure their junior high schools. [4] It was designed to spark collaboration between students, parents, officials, and teachers. There are many highlights that have resulted from this project, one being the planned and facilitated cross-site learning network among citizens in the different districts. This is an annual event that lasts three days and is hosted by the SNS Learning Institute branch. A spin-off of this occurred in the New England region in a two-day meeting in which cross-high school visits took place. An electronic newsletter named Adolescent Literacy Matters was also distributed and shared information on resources, events, strategies, and materials for learning styles.VI. Publications  For the Annenberg Institute for School Reform, publications are very important. They help get the word out about their cause in the hopes of getting more participation and feedback. On the AISR official website, there is a list of their printed and web publications, as well as their products. These can be found at:  http://www.annenberginstitute.org/Products/index.php .  Below are just a few titles and blurbs:  a. Collective Practice, Quality Teaching Voices in Urban Education 27 “To maintain teaching quality in hard-to-staff schools, education leaders need to view teaching not just as an individual act, but as a collective activity within and beyond school walls.” (Spring 2010)  b. Leading Indicator Spotlight Series “A series of research briefs that highlight three of the most useful and accessible leading indicators; early reading proficiency, algebra enrollment and achievement, and the use of college and pre-college admission test scores for high school placement.” (Spring 2010)  c. The College Pathways Tool Series “These tools include rubrics, surveys, focus group protocols, and examples of best practices to help high schools and their partners examine how well they are preparing students, especially low-income students, for graduation and college.” (Spring 2010)  d. Building Smart Education Systems Voices in Urban Education 26 “Highlights from the first twenty-five issues of VUE illustrate different components of a smart education system from a variety of perspectives. The disparate voices brought together by VUE have not always agreed, but out of their dialogue, common ground and a vision for smart education systems have emerged.” (Winter 2010)  e. Organized Communities, Stronger Schools: Case Study Series “A six-year study documents the positive impact of local community organizing on school capacity and student learning in seven urban communities.” (October 2009)VII.

Although the organization is not associated with the Democratic Party, it is understood that the members of the forum support democratic and progressive philosophy and candidates running for or in any type of political office. In accordance with their strong criticism of the Republican Party, one of the most popular applications of the website is the “Top Ten Conservative Idiots” list. With about 25,000 message postings a day, Democratic Underground is a sizable online community with the purpose of promoting liberal deliberation.History  Democratic Underground was founded by David Allen and Dave Allsopp. The website was launched on January 20th, 2001, the same day as the Inauguration of Republican President George W. Bush for his first term as president. The founding date of the website is no coincidence, primarily in the way that the website was created specifically to openly exhibit opposition towards George W. Bush’s victory over Al Gore for the presidency. According to Democratic Underground, as of June 2010, the website has almost 160,000 registered members and over 50,000,000 posts on their discussion boards in the last 9 years since their founding date in 2001.Activities  The vast amount of discussion boards are where most members associate themselves as participants with the website. Members are able to start new discussion topics and reply to other messages made by other members. Participants are also able to edit their own messages within one hour of the time they made their post. However, messages cannot be deleted after the one hour timeframe, but members can alert the website moderators and ask for a post to be deleted.  The 160,000 members participate in over 34 topic forums found on the website which include specific discussions on topics such as civil liberties, the economy, education, election reform, environment/energy, the media, health, national security, and more. Of the most popular forums, The DU Lounge, Latest Breaking News, and General Discussion are all discussion boards in which a range of topics can be discussed, rather than one specific subject matter. Participants are able to create a page called “My Forums,” which is a list if particular forums that are most interesting to them that they plan on visiting and participating in often. Because the website is so large and has so many members and postings, the “My Forums” option is a way to make Democratic Underground feel like a closer, more personal discussion forum.  “DU Groups” are another way for members to participate in deliberation. A DU Groups is a special type of discussion forum which is committed to a specific mission or project. The organization discusses these groups as “safe haven” discussion boards that require all group members who wish to be involved and post messages to agree to a mission statement for that particular cause. These groups are not suggested by the administrators or moderators of the site, but the members themselves. Through these groups, members are able to create smaller deliberation communities among the many members of the site.  The larger Democratic Underground community is also able to participate with each other by three popular pages: Lobby, Latest Page, and Greatest Page. The Lobby is the reference page with a list of all available forums to join along with a list of moderators. The Latest Page lists the most recent posts on the site, as well as a link the the Latest Breaking News forum for information. And finally, the Greatest Page allows members to be interactive with each others postings. On this page, threads are listed which have been nominated as “noteworthy” by the site members. Like the Greatest Page, threads can be recommended for the homepage as well which are chosen by the website administrators. These pages are important to the organization because these serve as important reference pages for what the organization stands for. These pages help visitors become informed about what forums are possible to join as well as what noteworthy posts have been made by fellow members.Features  In order to make the discussion most beneficial and correlate to the mission and purpose of Democratic Underground, the boards are equipped with voluntary moderators. According to their website, the moderators are responsible for the following duties:They answer questions from, and provide guidance to website visitors  They move, lock, or archive discussion threads for various reasons  They deal with copyright violations by website visitors  They delete disruptive and offensive posts  They shit off conservative disruptors  They alert administrators of any issues.These volunteers not only work for the betterment of the website, but act as participants in discussions as well. They can participate in the general website discussions posted, and also have their own moderators-only discussion board to talk with each other about any problems or issues with the website. When acting as a regular visitor or participant, the moderators are held at a higher standard when adding their input to discussion boards. When taking on a participant role, moderators are to adhere to the following standards:They are expected to behave themselves at all times in a way that reflects positively on Democratic Underground, and complies with all of the Rules and Regulations of the Website  They are expected to share and help promote Democratic Underground’s mission of left-wing unity and solidarity  They may not engage in personal attacks against other members of the board  They may not engage in attacks against other political, social or minortiy groups such as the Democratic Party, the Green Party, the Democratic Leadership Council, environmentalists, union members, gays and lesbians, Christians, etc. They are expected to avoid attacks against respected public figures in the Democratic Party or the political left.  They may not use their powers as a moderator to enforce a particular party line. It is not appropriate for moderators to threaten to ban someone with whom they do not agree  They are expected to be fair and evenhanded at all times, especially to those with whom they disagree  They are forbidden from discussing moderator business anywhere except in the moderators-only discussion forum. If it becomes apparent that a moderator has broken this rule, he/she will be relieved of moderator duties immediately, and may be banned from the discussion board as well.In order for the visitors and participants to insure that the moderators are acting accordingly, the website has an updated list of all current moderators, as well as their assignments, for visitors to be aware of. If they should be aware of any posting, the participants can simply click the “alert” button to alert a moderator. The different criterion that the moderators must meet shows the degree to which the organization is attempting to make effective and successful discourse. The organization makes this step in the deliberation process a priority for its members and visitors.Funding  Democratic Underground has four quarterly fundraisers each year. Before the fundraisers begin, members can suggest certain charities that should also benefit from the money raised. The last fundraiser for the 2009 year raised almost $1900 for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Parents, Family and Friends of Gays and Lesbians, Remote Area Medical Foundation, America’s Vet Dogs, and Treehouse for Kids. In this way, the fundraising process also includes a needed member deliberation. Those who choose to donate are recognized on the website with a gold star. The website also has a “Donate” link which members can donate to, and a Democratic Underground store as well which sells bumper stickers, shirts, coffee mugs, and bags.Secondary Literature  Pickard.

269,organization,The Annenberg Institute for School Reform,https://participedia.net/organization/269,Description not available.,0,2010-06-04,2017-09-18,134,Taryne,https://participedia.net/user/134,134,Taryne,https://participedia.net/user/134,en,,,Providence,Rhode Island,,United States,41.8239891,-71.4128343,University or Research,,,,,,,,,,,,,educations,,,," Mission and Purpose  The primary mission of the The Annenberg Institute for School Reform (AISR) at Brown University is “to develop, share, and act on knowledge that improves the conditions and outcomes of schooling in America, especially in urban communities and in schools serving disadvantaged children.” Through their numerous projects, the Institute seeks to explore the concept of what they call a “smart education system.” These systems are beneficial to education because they create networks between community members and organizations in order to promote a higher quality of learning among students.History  The Annenberg Institute for School Reform was founded in 1993 at Brown University. The initial establishment of the organization was made possible financially speaking through an anonymous donation to the university in the sum of $5 million. Later that year the Institute received an additional $50 million. This substantial gift came from Ambassador Walter H. Annenberg’s Challenge to the Nation, a five-year, $500 million effort to improve American Public Education. The funding from Mr. Annenberg allowed the organization to dramatically broaden the extent of its work and it was therefore renamed in his honor. The Institute’s first director, Dr. Theodore R. Sizer, worked to expand on the work he did previously as the founder and chairman of the Coalition of Essential Schools, another organization at Brown University. With the Annenberg Institute, however, Sizer chose to take a much broader approach. He simply wanted to support valid efforts to improve the quality of education for young students across America. The retirement of Sizer in 1996 sparked a nation-wide search for a new director. In the fall of 1998, Dr. Warren Simmons was named executive director of the Institute and he has continued to hold the position to this day. Under Simmons, the AISR adopted a new mission statement, focusing on the need for improving education in the nation’s more urban areas. In the year 2000, the Institute launched the Task Force on the Future of Urban Districts and opened an office in New York City. In 2001 the Institute’s main headquarters were moved off of the university campus. And in 2003, the organization began publishing their own quarterly journal entitled Voices in Urban Education. Later, in 2005, the Institute worked with the Brown University’s department of education to successfully establish a Master’s Program in Urban Education Policy, a degree program that focuses on many of the issues important to their organization. The Annenberg Institute’s programs and staff continued to grow over the next couple years and in 2007, it opened a larger office in New York City.Organizational Structure and Funding  The Annenberg Institute for School Reform (AISR) at Brown University is a non-profit research and reform organization that works with various school systems and communities to promote a higher quality of learning for students inside and outside of schools.The Annenberg Institute receives funding form a wide array of sources in order to pursue many of its major projects. The following is a list of the organizations current and most recent funders: Annenberg Foundation, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Bowne Foundation, Carnegie Corporation of New York, Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, Community Foundation for the National Capital Region, Donors’ Education Collaborative, Ford Foundation, Knox County Schools, Louisiana Disaster Recovery Foundation, Make the Road New York, Mobile Public Education Fund, Nellie Mae Foundation, New York Foundation, Rhode Island Foundation, Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Surdna Foundation, W.K. Kellogg Foundation.Specializations and Activities  Smart education systems demonstrate a strong bond between the school district and other groups within the community. The Annenberg Institute bases their mission on four core principles that focus on the importance of seeing results, establishing equity among students, involving the community, and encouraging learning.Major Projects and Events  Organized Communities, Stronger Schools: The Impact of Community and Your Organizing on Public School Reform – For this project, the Institute conducted a six-year study to analyze how community organizing for school reform affects the educational results in the community. The study examined the organization efforts of the residents in seven different urban communities. They then measured the impact of their efforts based on three criteria: district=level policy, school-level capacity, and student outcomes. In each of the seven case studies, the schools experienced positive results. In Austin, the groups education organizing resulted in new parent and school leadership, more funding, and even improved relationships between community members. The study conducted in eastern Pennsylvania showed that community organizing earned parents more access to school information and even caused a slight rise in high school attendance.  The Rhode Island Urban Education Task Force (UETF), one of the Institute’s more recent projects, began in 2008 when the governor of Rhode Island Donald Carcieri asked director Warren Simmons specifically to lead a task force to develop ways to enhance education in the state. The force included community members as well as governmental and civic leaders. It was focused principally in the five most urban schools including Newport, Providence, Woonsocket, Pawtucket, and Central Falls. In order to accomplish their goal, the UETF held countless forums to allow participation form the public to develop a broad range of solutions for the problem at hand. After considering these solutions and evaluating their potential for success, the group made recommendations to the Governor and the General Assembly. After the submission of a final report in October of 2009, the members of the state’s government began the process of implementing a some of the recommendations made by the task force.  The Emerging Knowledge Forum is a highly notable project that was developed in 2004 and continues to take place to this day. Every year, the Annenberg Institute holds a forum that lasts two days and involves approximately 125 participants. The goal of the forum is to bring together a group of people to offer diverse thinking on how to improve the education system. The extensive group discussions allow the participants to lean about the different approaches to creating new, more beneficial system of learning. The idea is that people will leave the forum, wanting to share their newly acquired knowledge with other members of their social network. This will help to create community support for the new ideas.  Voices in Urban Education, the Annenberg Institute’s quarterly journal, was developed in 2003 and is truly and ongoing project for the organization. Each issue presents diverse viewpoints surrounding the debate on how to improve education in urban areas. By presenting a wide array of solutions and approaches, the journal challenges readers to draw their own conclusions. The Institute views the journal as “a roundtable to air diverse viewpoints and share knowledge on vital issues in urban education.”Secondary Literature  Neuman, Mary, and Simmons Warren.

To achieve this goal, ADELS organized workshops, seminars, and conferences (including the annual ""Rencontres de la démocratie locale"") on topics such as deliberative democracy, participatory democracy, and the role these can play in reinvigorating democracy and achieving sustainable development at the local level. ADELS also published a monthly magazine, called ""Territoires,"" which examined developments in participatory democracy, among other things, at the local level in France and abroad. Through its local democracy observatory (""l'observatoire de la démocratie locale""), ADELS also maintained a list of participatory and deliberative initiatives undertaken by local governments in France aimed at involving citizens, community representatives, and organized interests in political decision making.For economic reasons, Adels closed definitly on 2012.

An association for direct democracy via Internet. Demoex makes it possible to be active in the local governments debates for anyone, but only members have the rights to vote and thereby influence our seat.  Demoex concept is to mix direct- and representative democracy. Our “agora” is the Internet site.  How does it work? When Demoex get the summons to a new meeting they open debates and referendums in all ""voteable"" issues. These issues are then debated before the members finally send their ballots the day before the meeting. The representatives in the local government votes to statistically represent the result from the internet referendums.  History Demoex started off as a grass-root initiative. It all begun at Vallentuna upper secondary school October 3rd 2000, when the municipality organized a theme day on “IT and democracy” and the question why so few young persons are politically active emerged.  Some students answered that they did not approve to choosing between ideologies. They expressed that their point of views were impossible to place on a political right-left scale. Other students were pessimistic about the aspects of political influence. “Decisions are made from above” they argued. Others answered they had no time to involve in politics. Others again thought of politics boring, tiring and insignificant.  After an internet debate an oral discussion with local politicians followed. The evaluation showed that students appreciated the speed and the structure offered by the electronic debate-system but they felt run over by the traditional oral debate.  From this experience a handful of students discussed with their philosophy teacher possibilities of developing democracy. That was how the Demoex idea was born. They decided to register a party and candidate for the local government in September 2002 with only one promise: Direct Democracy.  In January 2002 Demoex started to work on the project. Soon after they contacted Mikael Nordfors, a pioneer within e-democracy in Sweden. Already in the early 1990’s Mikael founded a party with a similar ideology. Mikael offered Demoex to use the software he had implemented through his company Vivarto.  Demoex made the site  [1] , and in the summer of 2002 they spread a leaflet in the local postboxes, made Demoex t-shirts and borrowed a housevan as base for the electoral campaign. A certain interest from the media gave some attention. Though the advertising campaign was small and cheap (2000 USD), it was enough to win the first direct democracy mandate in Europe.  Demoex was re-elected in 2006 and 2010.  More about Demoex is to be read in the blog  A failure .

To achieve this objective, IRI-Asia is currently:  (1)Advancing understanding of and commitment to the realization of direct democracy in Asia  (2) Promoting best practices and legislation of initiatives and referendums as a complement to representative forms of government in Asia  (3) Observing and reviewing the initiatives and referendums held in respective Asian countries  (4) Researching and publishing on issues regarding initiatives and referendums so as to improve the instruments of direct democracy  (5) Undertaking education activities related to direct democracy  (6) Cooperating with other organizations with similar purposes in promoting direct democracy around the worldHistory  Back in 2003, the long standing public demand for a referendum law in Taiwan gradually led to legislation. President Chen Shui-bian and the Democratic Progressive Party had made many campaign pledges in the year 2000 presidential election for such a law, promising that the right of citizens to initiatives and referendums that is already included in Taiwan’s constitution would be substantiated in Law by a DPP government. A law was finally passed on November 27, 2003, just a few months before the March 2004 presidential election.  Key experts and the founders of IRI-Europe and USA were the invited guest speakers in this project. The fundamental objective of the TFD was to give access to as many people as possible to independent expert opinion on direct democracy. As a result of this interaction in Taiwan between the TFD and the IRI-Europe and USA, the idea of establishing a sister IRI organization in Taiwan in order to help it implement direct democracy was borne. The objectives of IRI-Asia were set as the same as IRI-Europe and USA, which is to promote and advocate direct democracy in the world, provide education on its mechanisms to all interested parties, gather the talents of experts and scholars to improve the referendum and initiative instruments, and to help monitor their use in Asian countries.  The goal was thus set to make IRI-Asia the premier institution on direct democracy in the region, helping improve the instruments of direct democracy in Asia where they already exists (over 30 countries) or assist in implementing them where they do not.Activities  a) Project Civil Referendum 2007 Observation Mission (Hong Kong)  b) Direct Democracy in Local Politics in European Countries  c) Marburg Colloquy on Direct Democracy in Europe  d) International Steering Committee Meeting Agenda  e) IRI-Europe Event: Capacity Building Seminar on the European Citizens’ Initiative  f) International Conference on Direct Democracy in Latin America  g) International Conference on Deliberative Democrac  - Scholars and practitioners of deliberative and direct democracy from Europe, the US, Japan, and Korea gathered in Taipei to exchange experiences of practicing deliberative democracy in different cultural settings and political contexts.  h) The Realization of E-Deliberation: An experiment of “Online Citizen Conference”  - This experiment was a pioneer in effectively employing information and communication technology to facilitate face-to-face deliberation  i) Direct Democracy Study Trip in Europe  - The TFD then began to form a core group of 10 Taiwanese scholars and democracy advocates who undertook the TFD’s IRI-Asia project. The group was formed in the summer of 2004, and after a few meetings, first went on a European study tour that took them to 5 countries in 6 days in Sept-Oct. 2004. They discussed all aspects of direct democracy with European counterparts from old and new democracies, and also witnessed a national referendum in Switzerland.  j) International Symposium on Referendums, Initiatives, and Direct Democracy  - The members of the group had by then met a few times to draw the rough outlines of what IRI-Asia could be and do based on extensive discussion with direct democracy experts. The TFD sponsored a few of these members to produce the first ever guidebook on direct democracy legislations and practices in Asia, a worldwide digital database on national level referendums, and studies, conferences and concrete projects on deliberative democracyFunding  No recent findingMajor Projects  a) World Conference on Direct Democracy – First International Conference on Direct Democracy organized by the University of Zurich Center for Democracy in Aarau in cooperation with the C2D, the Research Center for Direct Democracy and IRI, the Initiative &amp; Referendum Institute Europe. It was hosted by the City of Aarau and the State of Argovia in cooperation with the Swiss Confederation Council of Europe, the Forum of Federations and the World Bank Aarau/Switzerland from October 1 to October 3, 2008.  b) Taiwan Country Report  c) Thailand – Pollwatch Final Report (Referendum) – Hosted by The Open Forum for Democracy Foundation  d) Philippines Country Report – Success and Pitfalls in Recent Philippine Politics  e) Direct Democracy in Bangladesh  f) Pollwatch/PNET – Final Report on Monitoring the Referendum of the Draft Constitution  g) Report on the Civil Referendum in Hong Kong - PCR will document the district referendum and the territory-wide referendum to share our practice with CSOs, both local and international. We will also experiment with more voting methods for cost effectiveness, e.g. - voting by mail or e-voting, but accuracy remains our primary goal.  h) Fourth International Conference on Federalism – New Delhi, India. - The Inter-State Council Secretariat, Government of India, in partnership with the Forum of Federations is organizing the Fourth International Conference on Federalism. This conference is the fourth in a series. Previous conferences were held at Mt. Tremblant in 1999, St. Gallen in 2002 and Brussels in 2005. The conference will have over 1,000 participants representing over 100 countries. The conference will be inaugurated by the Prime Minister of India and will also see participation by heads of state and heads of government from the world's leading federations.Evaluation and Critique  a) Analytic Process:  The Initiative &amp; Referendum Institute of Asia did not create a solid information base. They have not been maintaining their website and were last updated August 3rd, 2009. However, The IRI-Asia website does provide other important sources for the project they are working on with other organizations such as Taiwan Foundation for Democracy, World Forum for Democratization in Asia, and Initiative &amp; Referendum Institute of Europe.  With their mission of democratizing democracy so that people can participate directly in policy-making and take greater responsibility in governance, the IRI-Asia have done a great job prioritizing themselves by advancing their understanding of the direct democracy in Asia, promoting best practices and legislation of initiatives and referendums, observing and reviewing the initiatives and referendums held in respective Asian countries. The IRI-Asia has also been researching and publishing issues regarding initiatives and referendums so as to improve the instrument of direct democracy. They also have been undertaking education activities related to direct democracy and cooperating with other organizations with similar purposes in promoting direct democracy around the world.  The IRI-Asia has been participating in IRI from all over the world to learn about these best practices and using the things they learn at International Conferences on Direct Democracy in Latin America and International Conference on Deliberative Democracy. With attending conventions that talks about deliberation in a democracy, they were able to learn their problems and can identify a broad range of solutions.  IRI-Asia is an organization that mostly only sought out information and advice from expert on democracy deliberation. This makes weighing the pros, cons, and trade-offs of any ideas that are brought up by the people of Asia.  b) Social Process:  Some of the events that the IRI-Asia hosts do not provide a space for public engagement and discussion. For example, it hosted a team of six international observers from the IRI-Asia International Steering Committee (ISC) representing six countries in Asia and Europe from 19-24 March 2008 in Taipei to observe two national-level referendums. The observing teams focuses on researching and publishing on issues regarding initiatives and referendums so as to improve the instruments of direct democracy, but the project it is not open to the general public. Therefore, speaking opportunities are limited to those in the committees.  In 2004, IRI-Asia sponsored four community-level consensus conferences, which culminated in a joint press conference in which citizens had the chance to conduct face-to-face dialogue with high-level government officials. The event provides a space for public engagement and discussion; however, there is no information about the discussion within the committees, so it is hard to evaluate whether or not people in the committees have mutual comprehension, respect for other participants, and whether they consider others’ ideas and experiences.References  a)  http://www.iri-asia.net/?mod=About&amp;node_id=8  - IRI-Asia Official Website  b)  http://www.iri-asia.net/files/3.1.2.1Deepening%20Democratic%20Governance.pdf  - Deepening Democratic Governance by Marrying Direct (Scholarly source)  b)  http://www.iri-europe.org/  - IRI-Europe Official Website  IRI Europe is a non-partisan, non-profit-making association with headquarters in Marburg/Germany and brings together some of the best experts on and practitioners of the initiative and referendum process across Europe and the world.

Monroe 1395 2° C,,Buenos Aires,,,Argentina,-34.552254999999995,-58.449842,Non-Profit or Non Governmental,,,,,,,,,,,,,science,,,," The Evolution of DemocracyEudemocracy  (εὖ an ancient Greek word meaning: “true”, “better”, “good”, “happy”) is an open and direct democracy system that takes advantage of the new Information and Communication Technology to turn current representative democracy into an Eudemocracy. It is also a NGO established in Buenos Aires in the year 2009. We are currently developing the first web application for Eudemocratic governance in small communities.  Goals  Provide and foster efficient ways in which communities can enhance their involvement in governance. Our proposal takes into account everyone's skills and experience. As involvement aids the development of collaborative capabilities, it will also help pinpointing common priorities and avoid bureaucracy and corruption therefore leading to successful accomplishment of initiatives.  Developing such a tool for a Country is a complex matter. Hence, we started out with a simplified version of the issue: communities with up to 5000 members, with a certain structure and education level of its users in order to run the system. We've initially aimed at Universities; however NGOs, clubs and other neighbourhood organizations may fulfil the above requirements.Mission  Develop a Direct Democracy system through Internet; being implemented by small wired communities. We believe Web 2.0 has created the perfect environment where to nurse and nourish an Open, Direct Democracy, capable of finding its own place inside the current Representative system or even replacing it!  Without any kind of proscription on other Political Parties, all issues and proposals will flow through the system. It is truly an inclusive tool by nature, doesn't clash with any ideology or group. Furthermore, those who disagree with our proposal will be able to continue voting for representatives as they have been doing in the past without loosing their right to use the application as the rest of the community.Vision  We hope to prove that the only obstacle to achieving an Eudemocratic Government is the free and universal internet access for the whole society. Finally grounding the already proposed idea that the new illiterate is the one who lacks internet access.  This way, the current representative democracy (which is nothing but false or pseudo democracy) will finally fall to pieces, leading to the rise of a true democracy, never seen before since the times of Ancient Greece.Values  1. Social Spirit:  Amplifying society's capability to reshape its destiny, and our effort to definitely introduce popular participation in its own government.  2. Respect of diversity:  Channelling with absolute transparency and honesty the free speech of All members and Groups of each community through a plural system that provides sensitivity and equality towards everyone's needs.  3. Interdisciplinary:  Through team work, collaboration and creativity as indispensable tools, we make it possible for great ideas from anyone to take shape without concerning their technical skills.External LinksAsociación Civil EudemocraciaDirect_Democracy  organisations present on Participedia ",1,0,0,0,0,

Its  aims include abolishing barriers which seem to restrict access to direct democracy in Austria as well as guaranteeing free access to media.  According to the current legal situation, referendums must be passed and approved with a simple or two-thirds majority in the National Council. In this case, therefore, it cannot be said that the law proceeds from the people. The citizens elect the members of the National Council every four (in future five) years, but then have no way of initiating votes themselves. Only the so-called referendum is reserved to them, the result of which, however, is not mandatory.  Switzerland is a pioneer of direct democracy. The Swiss have referendums as soon as 100,000 signatures have been collected. It has been shown there that direct democracy has led to greater closeness to the citizen, trust in politics and stability.  Thus, a primary concern of the organization is to give the population the opportunity to initiate referendums themselves to ensure citizen involvement in the development process and in the question of a referendum. In Mehr Demokratie's view, the instruments of direct democracy should not replace representative democracy, but complement it.  Origins and Development  The organization existed since the beginning of 2006 and is independent from any political party.  In Austria, there are some laws which regulate direct democracy and we have different types of referendums. On the one hand, the so called “Volksbegehren” which has been held 32 times since 1964 has only limited effects. The parliament has to discuss the result and is not obliged to pass a new law. This kind of referendum can be initiated by 8023 citizens.  On the other hand, there is a “Volksabstimmung” whose results oblige the parliament to pass a new law. This type of referendum must be permitted by the parliament or the state president and has only been proceeded twice in Austria after the second world war. That kind of referendum cannot be initiated by the citizens.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  A non-partisan, nonprofit organization, Mehr Demokratie Austria is financed exclusively by donations that are not tied to any conditions.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  In addition to their focus on referendums, media laws are a focus of the organization based on the notion that they are necessary to ensure that citizens are informed in a balanced way when voting. Political television advertising for elections or voting campaigns is not permitted in Switzerland. In Austria, political parties happily advertise and politicians attend rhetoric courses. Mehr Demokratie advocates for open discussion programs instead of targeted propaganda.  The organization uses the potential of the Internet for our activities.

Our mission is to restore democracy in Spain. The Internet party has as objective to give voice to every citizen in the political process. Through our platform you can vote on every initiative presented in the Cortes Generales. In this way the political class is at the service of the society .  El Partido de Internet es un partido político que nace de una iniciativa popular cuyo principal objetivo es la participación ciudadana en el proceso político, con la intención de poner a la clase política al servicio de la sociedad.  Nuestra intención y por ende de todo aquel que se involucre es regenerar la Democracia en España. Para ello, tal como dice la Constitución, la soberanía es del pueblo español y por tanto hemos de ser partícipes de ella.  Los cambios necesitan de iniciativa y ésta es una humilde pero tremendamente ambiciosa iniciativa por mejorar las cosas.  En el PdI confluyen diferentes ideologías, visiones y espíritus teniendo como nexo de unión el propósito de participar y la meta de democratizar plenamente la sociedad. En este viaje caben todos por que todos tienen algo que decir y todos tienen el derecho a que su opinión sea escuchada. Eso es la Democracia.  El Partido de Internet quiere hacer de la Democracia algo real y tangible para la ciudadanía pues son los ciudadanos los que hacen funcionar la sociedad, los que la hacen crecer y evolucionar. Por eso en el PdI creemos firmemente que para evolucionar hay que involucrarse en el proceso. Si la ciudadanía se comporta como un mero espectador nunca podrá dirigir el proceso hacia donde su voluntad la guíe, pero si se involucra activamente podrá encauzar las decisiones, iniciativas y medidas en la dirección que su voluntad legítima haya determinado.  La iniciativa del Partido de Internet posibilita que la voz de la ciudadanía se escuche dentro del Congreso. He aquí en este punto lo realmente innovador, pues haremos saber en todo momento, con número exacto y en tiempo real lo que opina la ciudadanía. Ello se conseguirá creando un entorno virtual (web) de votación continua, de discusión y acuerdo dentro del propio partido que desembocará en una opinión mayoritaria que guiará la decisión final de el/la diputado en relación a todas las votaciones que se lleven a cabo.  Todo ciudadano puede entrar en la web del partido y expresar su opinión y conmutar su voto en cada votación del Congreso sin que para ello se haya tenido que afiliar al partido. Esto obedece a la propia identidad del partido: Participación Ciudadana sin cortapisas de ningún tipo.  Todos tenemos en mente la burocracia que impera en las diferentes instancias del estado, las numerosas leyes que se votan todos los días y de las cuales la ciudadanía en general normalmente no tiene conocimiento. Es por ello que en el seno del partido se han creado comisiones de información que clasificarán las votaciones en virtud de las diferentes materias que afecten la vida diaria del Estado. Acorde a esas clasificaciones se posibilitará la creación de diferentes grupos o corrientes de opinión dentro del entorno virtual para que todas las tendencias que conforman el abanico ideológico de la sociedad se vean reflejadas de facto en el seno del partido. Esos grupos serán los que inclinen la balanza en una dirección u otra a la hora de que nuestros diputados voten en el Congreso.  Los grupos se conformarán con una estructura idéntica para todos, formada por plantillas base que cada afiliado podrá personalizar acorde a sus inquietudes políticas. Esto posibilitará que cualquier votante pueda delegar su voto en un grupo o de manera independiente dependiendo del deseo del mismo.  Ser un afiliado del Partido de Internet es de por sí una identidad democrática. Un ciudadano que vota al PdI está implicándose con determinación en el proceso democrático. Se implica porque quiere cambiar las cosas. Se implica porque cree firmemente en que la polítca ha de ser parte de la ciudadanía y por tanto la voz de esta ha de ser escuchada en el Parlamento. Un afiliado tiene una responsabilidad para con los demás afiliados y por extensión para con el resto de la sociedad. Un afiliado forma parte activa de la vida diaria del partido, proponiendo contenidos e interviniendo en los debates, pero puede implicarse aún más cooperando con los demás afiliados y la organización del partido en cada una de las tareas para las cuales se vea preparado. En la Aventura de Regenerar la Democracia hay quehacer para todos.  Si la ciudadanía se comporta como un mero espectador nunca podrá dirigir el proceso hacia donde su voluntad la guíe, pero si se involucra activamente podrá encauzar las decisiones, iniciativas y medidas en la dirección que su voluntad legítima haya determinado.

IF believes that the health of a democracy depends on “how well its citizens discuss, explore and develop public policy.” Public policy choices should be based on careful consideration of reasonable alternatives, and the likely consequences of each of those alternatives should receive thorough analysis.  [1]IF wants to expand the quality of policy choices typically developed from real-world politics. Quick response to politically-charged crises limits the development of policy options available and discredits solutions outside of the mainstream. Often, politicians choose a solution which can be described as “the lesser of two evils”. The organization believes the full development of policy options requires the development and consideration of meaningful citizen input. Accordingly, the mission of the Interactivity Foundation “...is to enhance the process and expand the scope of our public discussions, thereby improving the health of our democracy and its development of public policy. That is, IF works to improve both the quality and quantity of the public discussions that shape the development of our public policy options.”  The Foundation works publicly and continually and “learns by doing”. It accomplishes its goals by conducting various “Project Discussions”, “Public Discussions”, and “Classroom Discussions”.  The Interactivity Foundation develops its own processes and procedures. The Interactivity Foundation is a non-partisan, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization. The IF does not engage in political advocacy for itself or any other organization or group. The organization does not provide grants to other groups, but occasionally engages in joint research.History  The Interactivity Foundation was founded and incorporated in 1965, under Delaware law, by West-Virginian businessman Jay Stern. The Interactivity Foundation was originally founded as the “Upper Ohio Valley Self Help Foundation”. Its name was changed to the current title in 1987. The Foundation conducted seven projects in the United States in the 1990s. In 2001, the IF hired several Fellows to further develop its processes and engage in more Projects. Jay Stern continues to provide significant contributions to The Foundation.  In 2002, the first series of Project Discussions began. Since then, the IF has continued to engage in Project Discussions. The conclusions of Project Discussions, when possible, have been used to create “Discussion Reports”.  Following the development of the Project Discussion process, the IF began working on ways to facilitate student-centered discussions in college classrooms. Development began in 2005, and the collegiate discussion process, Classroom Discussion, led to the creation of a Summer conference program named the Summer Institute. In the program, the IF works with college professors to adapt their discussion process to the classroom environment. The Summer Institute program was held in 2006 and in 2009. The programs had a lasting impact on the colleges where they were held: several college campuses now have sponsored courses, which facilitate the Interactivity Foundation's form of deliberative discussion.  Seeking more open and public projects, IF Fellows began testing the The Foundation's Discussion Reports in shorter discussion series in 2007. These discussions are now called Public Discussions. These projects have been “very helpful” in further developing the Discussion Reports used by the IF. Significantly, the Interactivity Foundation believes that Public Discussions are central to their mission.Structure  The Interactivity Foundation is governed by a Board of Trustees. The Board serves three, primary functions. First, the Board administers the financial matters of the IF. The Board also administers the Foundation’s general mission. Finally, the Board controls an Intellectual Development Committee, which handles the operational and day-to-day concerns of the organization. The Board of Trustees has central control over all of the organization’s decisions. While the main office and its staff are located in Parkersburg, West Virginia, the President of the IF, other members of the Intellectual Development Committee, and the Fellows reside in other locations throughout the United States. Most of the organization’s work is done in locations separate from its main office.Methods of Deliberation  Project Discussions  Project discussions focus on broad, complex topics of societal concern. Fellows facilitate discussions that focus on a variety of issues, such as the future of K-12 education, civil rights, food policy and property rights. Two panels of 5-8 citizens are recruited to participate in discussions about a specific area of public interest over an extended period of time. One panel includes persons with some form of expertise on the subject, known as “specialists”. The other panel consists of non-experts with an interest in discussing the topic, called “generalists.” The panels work independently for most of the project. At the end of the project, which can last over one year, the two panels meet to discuss and combine ideas while helping a fellow prepare a Discussion Report.  While the discussions are generally organic and non-linear, they are designed and facilitated to progress through several stages: “(1) exploring the emerging concerns about the topic that society might face; (2) developing multiple and different possible responses to those concerns; (3) exploring the possible consequences for each of those different approaches; which leads to (4) revision and often consolidation of the possibilities.” The process used is designed, specifically, to protect panelists from external and internal pressures. Social approval, time, and conventional wisdom are among the pressures prevented. Because Project Discussions provide for intellectual safety and comfort, the IF sometimes calls them “Sanctuary Discussions”. The combination of these stages and procedures forms a deliberative process created internally by the Interactivity Foundation for their own research and activities.  Classroom Discussions  The Interactivity Foundation also applies its discussion process to the classroom. Key similarities between the college environment and IF’s approach to public discussion include a long-term time framework without a demand for short-term payoffs, a focus on exploration for its own sake, a value in discourse and dialogue, and increased civic engagement. In 2006 and 2009, the Interactivity Foundation hosted and sponsored “Summer Institutes”. The IF selected and worked with interested college professors with mutual interests in the development of public discussion. These conferences have led the Interactivity Foundation to support a variety of college courses containing substantial elements of the organization’s discussion process. The Foundation continues to work with many professors for research and other projects.  Public Discussions  The starting points of public discussions (sometimes called citizen discussions) are policy reports generated by IF. Much like the longer-time project discussions, an active facilitator leads a discussion of 5-8 participants. However, public discussions only last 1-3 sessions. The goal of public discussions is to engage with the policy possibilities generated by the ""sanctuary"" panel and spread the deliberative process. IF sponsors the discussions in order to enrich public conversation and strengthen our democracy.Current Activities  The Interactivity Foundation is continually researching and developing its discussion process. Accordingly, IF sponsors and hosts both Project Discussions and Public Discussions. IF is planning its next Summer Institute, which will take place in 2012.  The following is a list of current long-term Project Discussions:  Future of Childhood  Shaping our Towns &amp; Cities,  Human Migration  Money, Credit and Debt  The Future of the Arts &amp; Society  Sports &amp; Society  The Future of the Family  The Future of Higher Education,  Crime &amp; Punishment  Democratic Practice &amp; Process  The following is a list of possible topics for current Public Discussions:  Food: What Might Be for Dinner?  Helping Out: Humanitarian Policy for Global Security,  Democratic Nation Building  The Future of K-12 Education  Global Security  Health Care: the Case of Depression,  Privacy &amp; Privacy Rights  Anticipating Human Genetic Technology  Science  Rewarding Work  Property &amp; Property Rights  The Future of Regulation  Helping America Talk  How Will We All Retire?

The president’s goal with this project was to make the government “inclusive, transparent, accountable, and responsible” (1). Through the OPE, the American public can voice their concerns about issues concerning our nation, and they can make their voices heard within the administration.  The goal of the OPE is to facilitate two-way discussion between the American public and the administration, through public, face-to-face events, as well as online resources. The American public can read about the activities of the OPE and the White House on the OPE blog, and can directly contact the OPE via an online form. In return, staff members from the OPE (if requested) will personally respond to messages they receive. In addition the OPE works side by side with the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs to assist with public outreach efforts (1).History  On his first day as President of the United States, Barak Obama issued a memo to leaders of executive departments and government agencies, asserting that “we will work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration” (3). Thus began a series of events in an effort to launch Obama’s plan for a government that was more open and transparent to the American people.  In late March of 2009, members of the National Coalition for Dialogue and Deliberation (NCDD), including AmericaSpeaks, Everyday Democracy, and Demos, held a one-day meeting about Obama’s Open Government Directive. At the meeting, which also involved representatives from 23 different federal agencies and offices, attendees discussed not only the technological and transparency issues of the President’s plan, but also considered the idea of incorporating face-to-face interaction with online interactions (3).  Previously the Office of Public Liaison, the Office of Public Engagement was launched by President Obama on May 11, 2009. In previous presidencies, the Office of Public Liaison had the primary purpose of communicating and working with lobbyist and special interest groups around the country (7). President Obama felt, however, that there needed to be greater opportunity to allow the American public to participate in government issues, events, and discussions. In May of 2009, Obama announced that the “office would seek to engage as many Americans as possible in the difficult work of changing this country, through meetings and conversations with groups and individuals held in Washington and across the country” (2). Instead of only communicating with special interest and lobbyist groups, Obama wanted to be able to create a way in which every American could engage in a two-way dialogue with his administration. Americans could voice their questions and concerns, and the administration could better inform the public about day-to-day goings on in the White House.  Along with the development of the OPE, Obama announced the creation of the Citizens’ Briefing Handbook. Using the website, change.gov, ordinary, everyday citizens were given the opportunity to submit, reflect over, and vote on various ideas and issues they felt the Obama administration should address. In the end over 44,000 ideas were submitted by about 125,000 users, and 1.4 million votes were cast; some of the most popular ideas accumulated tens of thousands of votes. The Citizens’ Briefing Handbook, contains some of those ideas which received the most votes, such as introduction of age-appropriate sex education to replace abstinence-only education, making “green” improvements such as a national high-speed rail system, and eliminating the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy. The book contains actual, unedited comments and concerns, put forth by American citizens. Once all of the top ideas were compiled, the book was delivered to President Obama (7).  There are currently 21 individuals on staff in the Office of Public Engagement. The current leadership in the OPE includes Valerie Jarrett (Senior Advisor and Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs and Public Engagement); Christina M. Tchen (Director of the Office of Public Engagement); and Michael Strautmanis (Chief of Staff to the Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Relations and Public Engagement) (6).Activities  Website- The Office of Public Engagement had its own official website, https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/engage/office. Through the OPE website, anyone can access the OPE Blog, biographies about the OPE staff members, and even a page which can be used to contact the OPE directly. On the ‘Contact’ page is an option where you can request a response, thereby facilitating the two-way communication that President Obama is striving for.  Blog- The Office of Public Engagement keeps a blog that can be accessed through the OPE website. The blog is updated a few times per month by staff members in the OPE, and highlights White House and OPE events that might not necessarily get news coverage, but that the public might want to know about. For example, the most recent entry, posted on October 9, 2010, discusses the involvement of Valerie Jarrett, Senior Advisor to the President, in the “It Gets Better” project, a nationwide campaign that addresses the struggles faced by young gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender individuals.  Anyone can subscribe to the blog and receive e-mails when the blog is updated. In addition to text, the blog also includes pictures and video that can be viewed by the public. The OPE Blog also includes links to all of the other White House blogs, as well as a Blog Archive, which is organized by date, as well as by issue; people can read blog entries from different areas of the White House based on which issues concern them the most, such as education, the economy, health care, immigration, veteran’s issues, or social security issues (5).  Public Events- The OPE, in seeking to gain feedback from Americans outside of the Washington, D.C. area, reaches out to the rest of the nation through public events and town meetings, during which everyday citizens can come out and voice their opinions and concerns about issues that are important to them, such as health care, the environment, and education (7). In addition to in-person public events, the OPE also organizes online forums which function as ""virtual town halls"", where Americans can join in the discussion of topics that concern them, such as healthcare (7). Some examples of public events that have been held in the past are an online community health forum in Michigain, as well as a town hall meeting in California.Funding  The White House Office of Public Engagement is funded by the United States federal government.Major Projects  The OPE discussed many of its major projects on its blog, such as the President’s Forum for Young African Leaders. On August 3, 2010, President Obama hosted 115 young African leaders during a three-day event, . During this forum, representatives from many different African countries were able to share their thoughts and visions for the future of their countries, and for the future of Africa as a whole (5). Other major projects of the OPE include reaching out to various distinguished groups in our nation, such as youth (U.S. Senate Youth Program, Big Brothers and Big Sisters of the Year, Children’s Miracle Network Champions, etc.), the disabled (celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act, supporting the Paralympics, etc.), and Native Americans (support of the Recovery Act, which awarded $224 million to enable Indian tribes to build and renovate prisons and jails on tribal land) (5). First and foremost, however, the OPE’s major project was to be the mediator of communications between the administration and the American people. The main purpose of the OPE was to give a voice to the American people, and to make sure that their views are heard by the administration.  As mentioned above, one of the major projects of the OPE was the Citizen's Briefing Handbook, which was full of American citizens' ideas and concerns about our country. Categories within the book included Economy; Education; Energy/Environment; Foreign Policy; Healthcare; Homeland Security; Service; Technology; and Veterans, as well as additional issues such as the legality of marijuana and marriage equality (8).  Top vote-earning ideas under each of these categories include:  Economy -Revoke Bush Tax Cuts for top 1% earners; Make reduced-scale farming affordable; less dependence on imported foods  Education -End government-sponsored abstinence education; introduce age appropriate sex-education  Environment - Commitment to becoming the ""greenest"" country in the world; Introduce/increase use of bullet trains and light rail systems; Increase MPG requirements on new cars  Foreign Policy -Permanent closure of facilities such as Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib  Healthcare -Stop using federal resources to undermine states' medical marijuana laws  Homeland Security -Eliminate ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell""; Find a balance between U.S. security and civil liberties  Service -National Service Corps  Technology -Boost America's economy by legalizing online poker; Each of the 50 state governors should create their own version of the Citizen's Briefing Handbook to gather ideas  Veterans -Signing bonuses for enlistment should not be revoked due to injuries beyond the control of the soldiers; Do away with unacceptable tour extensionsSecondary Literature  -Citizen's Briefing Handbook.

Through economic, environmental, physical, and human growth they are able to take steps and make goals in order to revitalize their neighborhood. ""DSNI works to implement resident-driven plans with non-profit organizations, community development corporations, businesses, and religious groups."" [1]  The Dudley Street Neighborhood has progressively grown into a joint effort of over 3,000 volunteers committed to renew this culturally diverse neighborhood of over 24,000 people. DSNI is the only community-based nonprofit in the country which has been granted eminent domain authority over abandoned properties within its boundaries. The eminent domain authority was applied to the vacant land in a 60 acre area called the ""Dudley Triangle"" This organization aims to achieve affordability, while also preserving the neighborhoods character. The Dudley Street Neighborhood is committed to continuing the efforts of the combined community, and with their community collaboration they hope to create affordability, permanence, and pride for the Dudley neighborhood.History  By the late 1970s and early 1980s, many of the homes in the community adjoining Dudley Street had been abandoned or burned by property owners in hopes of profit or fear of gentrification. The vacant land was being used as a dumping zone for garbage, sanitation companies, and contractors working on nearby urban renewal projects would dispose of their refuse on the lots. The city began to appear as a garbage dump or junkyard with abandoned cars along the street sides. In the early 1980s, a group of women started a campaign, called ""Don't Dump on Us."" This campaign gained the attention of the public and the Mayor. This began the start to revitalization through the help of the city. It began to regulate the abandoned lots and participated in clearing away the broken down cars, and waste. Following the initiatives success, ""the group met with a class at MIT to develop a long-term plan for revitalizing the neighborhood.""  [2]  A local Boston foundation gave its support, however not much impact was noticed. This was due to the foundation dispersing their money to a number of smaller projects, rather than only one. This foundation then redirected their efforts, and fully invested into Dudley Street. However, redevelopment plans were hindered due to the inconsistency of land within the neighborhood. The city had taken over approximately half of the land from past tax delinquency and those pieces were in the way for DSNIs plans. DSNI realized that a Massachusetts law could enable them to gain eminent domain [3] over much of the community's abandoned parcels. After four years of dealing with the court and convincing the City Hall, Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative gained the right of nearly one-half of the land in the neighborhood. Dudley Street Initiative had to then find the funds to purchase this newly available land. The Riley Foundation supported DSNI amounting to $1.4 million through the years, and contributed to the legal work on the eminent domain case. Without sizable support from banks and conventional lenders, finding the money to fund the purchase of the land was difficult. The Ford Foundation agreed to make a $2 million loan. From this $2 million loan, D.S.N.I. was able to grow immensely and has continued to prosper.  Of the neighborhoods 24,000 residents, 40% are African-Americans, 30% Latin Americans mostly from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, 24% Cape Verdeans, from islands off the coast of West Africa, and 6% Whites mostly elderly Irish and Italians who have lived in the neighborhood since the 1950s.  The organizations active membership has grown steadily, and now numbers near 3,600. More the 150 people met to plan out the future of Dudley Street Neighborhood in an eight-month series of meetings that were conducted in Spanish, Cape Verdean as well as English. The membership board came up with a wide- ranging plan that focused on maintaining culture, and building the community spirit through new opportunities, housing, and youth involvement. To this day, bike paths, a community center, community gardens fountains, art programs, a town commons, youth programs, parent meetings, and college opportunities have been made possible for this neighborhood.  Today:  There are more than 3,600 members, over half of 1,300 vacant lots have been transformed into homes, parks, playgrounds, gardens, schools, community centers and a Town Common. There are over 400 new homes built since the start of DSNI, and residents who were children at the start of DSNI are now active leaders in the communitySpecializations and Activities  DSNI holds Board Meetings, tutoring opportunities, neighborhood meetings, and events for the youth and children of the area. They encourage meetings to help the academic education of the youth in their neighborhood. They provide activities where parents along with children can receive special information on testing, college, or other options for schooling. Many of their activities are to encourage community involvement and to have active members of their community.Major Projects and Events  The Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative is governed by a 34-member Board of Directors. Community-wide board elections are held every two years at the DSNI Annual Meeting. For the Board of Directors, equal representation is provided for the community's four major cultures-African American, Cape Verdean, Latino, and White. The structure of the DSNI board is as follows:  16 Residents from the whole area  5 Nonprofit agencies representing the Health and Human Service fields from the core area  2 Community Development Corporations from the core area  2 Small Businesses from the core area  2 Religious Organizations from the core area  3 Youths from the core area (ages 15-18)  2 Nonprofit organizations or groups fro, the secondary area  2 Residents appointed by the newly elected board  Agreeing to be on the Board of Directors of the Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative, all members must make a pledge to ""empower Dudley residents to organize, plan for, create and control a vibrant, diverse, and high quality neighborhood in collaboration with community partners."" They then further pledge to support the residents' and community's right to shape all plans, programs, and policies affecting their quality of life. The pledge also includes to control the development of neighborhood land, live in a healthy and safe family, supportive environments, the right to education/career/economic opportunities, quality, affordable housing and child care, safe accessible public transportation, quality services, and a full spiritual and religious life.  Dudley Neighbors Incorporated (DNI)  The Dudley Neighbors was created by the Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative to achieve the housing development portion of DSNI's plan for revitalization. In 1988 DNI's request to become a Massachusetts 121A Corporation was approved by the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA). This enabled DNI to obtain privately-owned vacant land in the area designated as the Dudley Triangle. These parcels of land are leased to private and nonprofit developers in order to build affordable housing within the Board of Directors master plan. ""DSNI’s focus on community empowerment expresses their fundamental belief in the wisdom and collective power of the community, led by residents, to realize their shared vision."" [4]Dudley Youth Council (DYC)  DYC was formed by Dudley youth to empower and give a ""united youth voice"" in the Dudley area.  [5]  The mission was to empower and give motivation to youth in order to develop goals and plans. They have orchestrated sports tournaments, and radio shows where the youth chose the topics.  GOTCHA (Get off the Corner Hanging Around) Youth Jobs Collaborative  DSNI works with five organizations in Roxbury and Dorchester (Bowdoin Street Health Center, Bird Street Community Center, Dorchester Bay EDC and The City School). They form a collaborative effort to provide youth jobs and connect them with opportunities to build valuable skills with the help of professionals. Ultimately they foster leadership among the youth, and help build a caring, strong community. They provide meaningful employment opportunities while also making available personal, emotional, and intellectual supports. The nonprofits involved continue to strengthen and develop their capacity to work with teens.  Dudley Children Thrive: Community Developing Children (DCT)  This is a new initiative created by a group of local agencies arranged by Dudley Street Initiative. DCT works directly with Children’s Services of Roxbury, Project Hope, and La Alianz Hispana as partners in discovering and handling the needs of Dudley neighborhood children up to 5 years. Their united mission is to begin by academically strengthening the children from a young age, to develop high achieving and successful children. Dudley Children Thrive hopes to initiate a bar of excellence by educating families and educators with programs, resources, and information.  College Bound  DSNI’s College Bound program introduces Dudley neighborhood youth to opportunities available to them after high school. They organize college visits, interaction between youth and those who have went to college from the neighborhood, and by providing families with the knowledge in assisting their child and encouraging growth and development. Boston Parent Organizing Network DSNI and five other community-based organizations joined forces to form the  Boston Parent Organizing Network.  This group, comprised of Boston’s parents, students, families, and others worked to improve the public school system. “For the first time, Community based organizations linked their neighborhood successes to the challenge of underperforming schools and in improving the quality of education that Boston children were receiving.”  [6]Funding  It is unknown how much money is given to this organization, however founders and partners include:  Amelia Peabody Foundation  Bank of America Charitable Foundation  Boston Compassion Capital Fund  Boston Foundation  Boston Parent Organizing Network (BPON)  Annie E. Casey Foundation  Citizens Bank  Georgeanna Goddard Eaton Memorial Fund  EarthShare of New England  Foley Hoag Foundation  Hyams Foundation  Jessie Smith Noyes Foundation  NSTAR Financial  Sovereign Bank  State Street Bank  Wellington Management Co., LLPPublications  In 1994, the acclaimed book Streets of Hope was published about DSNI.Evaluation and Critique  Through the DSNIs diverse, 34 seat Board of Directors, the organization incorporates 16 board members who are residents from each of the four major ethnic groups (African-American, Latino, Cape Verdean, White) plus the two additional board appointed residents, and three youth, they are able to reflect on personal values that directly effect the decisions that will be made by the Board. These participants alone will have a very different opinion then those who are not directly residents but are from the church or local businesses. This enables the Board to accurately meet all the demands and touch on all bases of concern, criticism, or support. Within these meetings are translators to ensure comprehension among every member. The Board of Directors must all sign a DSNI Board Pledge which in one aspect participants must agree to support the residents' and community's right to ""shape all plans, programs, and policies affecting our quality of life.""  [7]  This pledge alone holds every member of the board, all which are residents or community members, accountable to showing respect in opinions and thoughts that take place during the meetings and outside. In brainstorming ideas, and problems the Board of Directors work together to develop strategies to ""ensure that local residents are the primary beneficiaries of the community economic growth, and that human development and environmental issues are addressed.""  [8]The Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative has found ways to implement the opinions of residents with those of surrounding professionals in order to reach their full potential in revitalizing the neighborhood economically, environmentally, and through its inner members. They have done a thorough job at providing numerous avenues for success and knowledge, while ""organizing and empowering the residents of the neighborhood to create a shared vision of the neighborhood and bringing it to reality by strategic partnerships.""  [9]  They have brought together a diverse group of people for the betterment of a cultural flourishing neighborhood. The have executed a deliberative practice in both their neighborhood meetings, and through their diverse Board of Directors. An additional idea that would only strengthen their quality of deliberation would be to create more frequently available meetings, open for all residents of the neighborhood to come. There could be separate meetings available for the different ethnic groups or areas of town, on specified dates, where they could attend and express their concerns or ideas together, comfortably. Then approximately two members from each of these meeting groups would come together to present their data. This would be a structured meeting where every group of people is able to have an educated opinion from those of their nationality or area of town. Different areas of town, or different ethnic groups may express different needs or concerns affecting them directly. This would be an accumulation of information from a larger sample of residents in the neighborhood. More ideas may be expressed and others may reflect on those opinions presented.Referenceshttp://www.dsni.org/dni/http://www.dsni.org/youth.shtmlChoosing Healing Over Saving by Gregory A Smith  Encounter; Spring2004, Vol. 17 Issue 1, p31-37, 7p  http://web.ebscohost.com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&amp;hid=17&amp;sid=7e4bf08f-95cd-492d-a783-264da996f298%40sessionmgr14""Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative.""

The organization helps provides opportunities for citizens to actively engage themselves in deliberation with officials to best practice democracy and to improve policy-making procedures.Its main focus is to further develop Information Communication Technologies (ICT) tools, which will help promote transparent governance by giving citizens more opportunities to participate.Gov2U’s main goal is to have a Global Leadership Profile so that it can globally share its innovative tools of bettering governments. Their goal can be achieved by completing these five objectives:(1) The organization hopes to promote the use of ICT-tools between Legislative and Elected Bodies to make such parliamentary and legislative procedures more efficient. By doing so, they will be creating this sense of transparency between the citizen’s opinions and the Elected Bodies’ decisions. Thus, it helps the people have a stronger voice in their government.(2) By becoming one of the leading organizations, GOV2U feels that it has the necessary tools to make Legislatures more effective and make the democratic process stronger. Democracy is the idea of giving the people the opportunity to voice their opinions to the officials whom they have elected. By using modern technology, as GOV2U suggest and since most are accustomed to the online network, society would be more inclined to participate since it is made readily available to them. At GOV2U, they believe in the unrealized potential of ICT-tools and how its significant value can help increase democratic participation.(3) It hopes to educate both citizens and Elected bodies in regards to public information and political issues through ICT-tools because they feel it will increase the accountability between both sides since the data will be readily accessible.(4) By using unique and innovative ICT-tools, this organization wishes that this would help instill a sense of motivation to other organizations and governments to advance their current tools. By doing so, new standards will be expected for their projects and thus, will result in new developments to better the organization and its practices in the future years to come.(5) Lastly, GOV2U is able to ultimately have the Global Leadership Profile they wish to attain through sharing their knowledge and creativity “to the community of public, academic, civil, and private professionals and citizens through workshops, seminars, and conferences.” This not only helps their public relations images but also establishes them as a credible, strong, and branded source that others would trust because its great presence.HistoryIn 2005, a group of professionals from the fields of Legislative Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and community activism, including its current Executive Director, Vasilis Koulolias, created a non-profit, non-governmental organization now known as GOV2U to better citizens’ participation in the decision making processes of their governments. Less than three years later, GOV2U became one of the Top 10 most influential players in the realm of politics and the Internet according to PoliticsOnline  [2] . Currently, the organization acts as a global consultant, helping governments become more familiar with technological advancements that can modernize the legislative process so that citizens can gain easier access to participate in such democratic procedures.Awards and RecognitionWithin only two years of GOV2U’s existence, the organization was voted as Top 20 Who Are Changing the World of Internet and Politics (2006) and Top 10 Who Are Changing the World of Internet and Politics (2007). These awards acknowledge the organization for integrating the online world and democracy.With such high recognition, GOV2U is making progress in becoming a globally renown tool for promoting political deliberation through its campaign for greater citizen participation through online use.Specializations and ActivitiesGOV2U provides a range of services for various legislatures, specializing in the fields of e- Government, e-Democracy and e-Participation, all in which incorporate the use of ICT tools.The organization includes four main activities:1) It finds ways to create, customize, and maintain ICT tools that best fit the government they are working with according to the citizens’ and elected officials’ needs and specific criteria.2) The organization gathers legislative information through the use of necessary technological tools that it deems useful to the government.3) GOV2U strives to help the governments they are working (local, regional, or national) with develop their network infrastructure by implementing the following: - Using organization and grouping skills - Developing regulations and procedures - Creating strategies to better implement legislative practices - Operations and personnel guidelines - Training team members who will actively engage themselves with the ICT applications introduced by GOV2UCurrently, GOV2U is working on its image and branding so that it can become a better-known tool on global scale. Examples in which they have increased their public relations include organizing seminars and promotional events, which showcase their services. They also attend conferences, seminars, and workshops both regionally and internationally to reach a wider scope of potential GOV2U users.GOV2U ProjectsCurrently, GOV2U is participating in the following projects:QUESTAO PUBLICA  [3]  : GOV2U in conjunction with the Centre for Research on Direct democracy of Zurich University and other local organizations in Avina and Ethos work to increase participation in Presidential elections in Brazil.USPEAK  [4]  : This is a program that GOV2U collaborates with the National Democratic Institute to help the advancement of MPs relations in Uganda and other African countries.Agios Stefanos  [5]  : Since 2008, GOV2U has consulted and provided IT service to the Municipality of Agios Stefanos by introducing eParticipation tools to citizens and municipal authorities.WeGov  [6]  : The WeGov project incorporates social networking sites such as Facebook  [7] , Twitter  [8] , etc. to encourage dialogue between citizens and policy makers. The key feature of this project that promotes great deliberation is the fact that existing social networking communities already have high levels of participation and by feeding off of these sites, the potential to reach a larger audience is quite plausible. GOV2U is one out of six organizations that are helping to establish this social networking platform.SPOCS  [9]  is a project created by European Commission which hopes to remove administrative restrictions that numerous European businesses deal with before opening their services to other countries abroad. SPOCS goal is to make the transaction between borders easier for all businesses with the help of  GOV2U  to help it become more established and well known around all EU Member States.Africa4allproject  [10]  : This project will hopefully help engage both Parliament and the general public in their legislative procedures through the use of ICT tools. Its goal is to make such technological advancements and platforms available to all participating African countries.Stork  [11]  : Stork is an eGovernment identity project cofunded by the EU which aims to create a system for electronic identity (eID) so that businesses will be able to operate their services without any border barriers. GOV2U is leading all necessary activities to help this eGovernment project launch.VoiceS  [12]  : VoiceS is platform that is created to help promote dialogue between citizens in European regions and their policy makers to ensure that there is direct communication between the two groups.U@marenostrum[13]  : GOV2U helped build this platform with a web-based Public Participation Geographic Information System that is needed to further engage citizens in discussion regarding the environmental problems related to their surrounding regions.Projects that GOV2U has participated in the past include the following: VoicE  [14] , eGovMoNet  [15] ,  Demos@Work[16] , Ucount4eu  [17] , Acaparticipacio  [18] , Amposta  [19] , DGPC of Aragon  [20] , GOV2Demoss  [21] , eConsensus  [22] , e-Representative  [23] , Karditsa , Metamorphose  [24] , Tegea, and Upper Kirby [ www.upperkirbydistrict.org] .From the lists above, it is evident that GOV2U has participated in numerous, diverse projects that all help engage citizens in active participation with the decision-making processes of their governments. This greatly supports deliberation and contributes to a stronger democratic process because both the represented and elected with actual legislative power are able to contribute their ideas and collaborate to better their government.PublicationsSince Gov2U has such a user-friendly interface and encourages frequent social interaction with political deliberation, its website is constantly updated with daily publications, event notifications, and press releases.As a result, the link to its publications is as listed below:Gov2u News  [25]  Gov2u Events  [26]Both links show when Gov2U will attend specific global conferences, workshops, and seminars. As well, it features upcoming projects that the organization will be working on as well as information regarding the cofunding sponsor of that project.Secondary Sources(eGovernment &amp; CIP Operations Newsletter June 2007)  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/egovernment/newsletter/newsletter_may_june_2008.htm(Interview with Vasilis Koulolias, Executive Director of Gov2u)  http://www.egovblog.com/2007/03/21/interview-with-vasilis-koulolias-executive-director-of-gov2u/(ICT for Governing and Policy Modeling)  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/egovernment/research/fp7/fp7_workshop/documents/constituency_building_workshop_report.pdf(Bringing social and technological innovation to the work of national, regional and local elected representatives: The eRepresentative Project)  http://itc.napier.ac.uk/itc/Documents/Krems_eRep08.pdfExternal LinksBelow are links that are great resources to provide further information regarding GOV2U.http://www.gov2u.org/http://www.opengov2010.be/http://www.youtube.com/user/Government2UEvaluation of Gov2uGov2u is an opportunity for citizens to actively engage themselves in political deliberation because it aims to help bridge the gap between the common people and those who are elected. Through using ICT tools that most are already familiar with, Gov2u is simply making these opportunities more readily available. With such programs that promote technologically integrated campaigns, citizens will be more inclined to participate, thus making legislative procedures more democratic. Eventually with such advancements, educating others on specific policies, presidential candidates for elections, and other important political procedures will be much easier. As a result, more and more participants will become involved in such deliberative processes resulting in a better democracy.  ",1,0,0,0,0,

The White Citizens' Council used economic, social, and political pressure to oppress African Americans.

The Council was formed in the 1950s after the Supreme Court outlawed school segregation in  Brown v. Board of Education . Under the leadership of  Robert B. Patterson , the Citizens' Council was formed on July 11, 1954, to resist desegregation. It was started in Indianola, MS, and expanded to other states, including Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Missouri. It attracted middle to upper-class civilians, most of them politicians, doctors, lawyers, teachers, bankers, and businessmen. The Citizens’ Council lasted approximately 25 years, from 1954 – 1979. [1]Unlike the  Ku Klux Klan  and other racist groups during the  civil rights movement , the Citizens' Council was not rooted in violence. Instead, the Citizens' Council focused on using economic, social and political pressures to oppress African Americans and supporters. While common stereotypes often portray racism to be behavior exemplified by the working and uneducated class, the Citizens’ Council showed that racism is also practiced by educated, upper class citizens. Characterized by their fear of miscegenation, the Citizens’ Council chronicled an important time in American history when it was not a law, but the people themselves that restricted each other from achieving civil rights. As Earl Johnson, a former member of the Citizens’ Council writes, “...it looked like to me that the Citizens' Council was just stirring up hate among whites and really was accomplishing nothing except just building an organization of members paying dues.” [2]  The Citizens' Council monitored all aspects of life in the Deep South with the aid of  Jim Crow laws  hoping to retain the status quo prior to the move towards integration. They heavily influenced outcomes of elections, health care policies, economic sanctions and progress, school districts, and other agenda.Origins and DevelopmentOn May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that “in the field of public education, the doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ has no place. Separate but unequal education facilities are inherently unequal.”  [3]  The Court further ruled that segregation in any public place was unequal. This proclamation for integration was celebrated by black Americans everywhere, but in the South it was received with skepticism. Known infamously as "" Black Monday ”, Southern whites were greatly concerned with the Supreme Court’s unanimous decision, and many felt the threat of this change in status quo. Mississippi Senator  James O. Eastland  said, ""On May 17, 1954, the Constitution of the United States was destroyed because of the Supreme Court's decision. You are not obliged to obey the decisions of any court which are plainly fraudulent [and based on] sociological considerations.”  [4]The first Citizens’ Council meeting was held in a living room in  Indianola, Mississippi  on July 11, 1954. Robert “Tut” Patterson, a plantation manager, led the chapter. Attendance was approximately 100 people, including the town mayor and civic attorney. By August 1955, membership in the Citizens’ Council had exceeded 60,000 people, and included 253 Councils. In August 1956, the Citizens’ Council had expanded to 30 states to form the  Citizens’ Council of America , with the goal to preserve the “natural” rights of racial segregation and the “maintenance of our States’ Rights to regulate public health, morals, marriage, education, peace and good order in the States, under the Constitution of the United States.” Membership for the Citizens’ Councils peaked at 250,000 in 1957. The Citizens’ Council of America had an influential board of advisors, including Senator James O. Eastland and Representative John Bell Williams of Mississsippi, Senator J. Strom Thurmond and Representative L. Mendel of South Carolina, and Governor Marvin Griffin of Georgia.  [1]In April 1957, a fifteen-minute telecast, “Forum” began its weekly broadcast over WLBT-TV in Jackson. Telecasts were shown by twelve stations across Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and Virginia, and radio tapes were broadcasted over fifty stations in the South. In 1962, the Civil Rights Act practically all but destroyed the Citizens’ Council’s work as racial integration became more widely popular. That September 29, President Kennedy federalized Mississippi National Guard troops to force integration at the  University of Mississippi  (Ole Miss).  [4]The Sovereignty Commission  announced on October 19, 1964 that monthly payments to the telecast “Forum” would be reduced from $4,500 to $2,000. Viewer attention started to dwindle, and by December 1964, only a few stations in Mississippi and neighboring states still regularly played “Forum” programs. This decline can be explained through a number of factors, but mostly Southerners grew wary of upholding such strict traditions in an era of forward and progressive thinking. As African Americans started to gain political, economic, and social status, businesses could no longer deny services to African Americans. Political leaders and other community officials started to liberalize towards integration, and the balance shifted favorably towards civil rights in the South. The social cultural change was generally accepted by Southern citizens, who became reluctant to associate with racist groups that were being condemned by the rest of the nation.  By the 1970s, support had drastically diminished for the Citizens’ Councils. There was a brief revival in 1985 when a new group emerged dedicated to preserving the privileges of white America, The  Council of Conservative Citizens (CCC) . The CCC was founded in St. Louis, MO in 1985 by leaders in the Citizens’ Council, including Robert Patterson. However, like the Citizens’ Councils, the CCC held extremist views of white supremacy and white separatism by promoting “the interests of European Americans”.  [5]Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingThe majority of funding came from members themselves, who paid dues every meeting. The Citizens' Councils especially attracted wealthy members of society. Membership was open to anyone who fit the correct description: white, powerful, and racist. Members paid dues and attended weekly meetings in local homes, courthouses, schools, and other locations. A typical meeting in Mississippi is described by Erle Johnston, former director of the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission: “Big speaker [would] get up and say, ‘We're not going to let the federal government do so-and-so. We are not going to do so-and-so. Come on. Bring your money up here. Let's join. Give us your money.’ So people would give their money and leave there, and they would feel better, like an emotional purgative, even though no plan had been adopted; no course had been assumed.”  [2]The other way to receive revenue was from the publicly-funded  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , an agency that promoted segregation. In 1956, the Mississippi legislature formed the State Sovereignty Commission. The Sovereignty Commission contributed generous funds to the Citizens’ Council, and also offered their investigation through a covert network that tracked blacks and whites.  [1]  The Citizens’ Council did not keep specific records, but speculation estimates its annual budget in 1956 to be around 400,000 in Mississippi alone. William J. Simmons estimated the budget to have fallen to around 200,000 by 1963.  As Southern blacks began their civil rights movement through boycotts, protests, and other forms of revolt, Southern whites also began their own form of resistance. When Southern blacks boycotted the bus system in Montgomery, Alabama in 1955, the Citizens’ Council gained an exponential increase of membership. Southern blacks were evicted by landlords, fired by employers, denied credit by merchants, refused service, and assaulted. Other members worked to prevent African American voters from rolls, threatened to fire employees who registered to vote or integrate public facilities, and foreclosed businesses and farms.  [6]Present Day  Today, the  Council of Conservative Citizens  (CCC) continues to exist, and is headquartered in St. Louis, MO. They follow a “Statement of Principles,” written by  Dr. Samuel Francis , the former editor of the Citizens’ Informer newspaper and a member of the CCC National Board of Directors. The “Statement of Principles” begins with a declaration: “The American men and women who make up the Council of Conservative Citizens believe in, commit themselves to, and pledge to work for and support these fundamental principles of American civilization, liberty, justice, and national safety.”  [5] A list of 14 points detail the United States as a Christian country, the preservation of European peoples in the United States, as well as specific policies on family, the environment, national and state law. CCC has chapter sites in Alabama, California, Mississippi, and the Carolinas, and also European allies, including the  British National Party ,  Vlaams Belang  (in Flanders, Belgium), and  Front National  (in France). Members of the CCC describe themselves as “the country’s most effective conservative activist group.” The group publishes a newspaper, The Citizens’ Informer, that is delivered quarterly. Each issue contains a section called “Council News”, which contains events happening in local chapters. CCC can also be heard on Talk Radio, where the CCC CEO Gordon Baum and member Earl Holt have hosted “Right at Night” for 10 years. The station was shut down after the death of the station’s owner.  The Political Cesspool Radio Program  is another radio broadcast that can be heard live every Saturday evening from 6:00pm – 9:00pm CT in Memphis, Tennessee.Specializations, Methods and ToolsEducation  Since the Citizens’ Council’s Movement was rooted in opposition for segregated education, it was no surprise that a good majority of attention was focused on school boards. The Dallas Citizens’ Council was founded in 1957 with a membership of 25,000. Supported by Representative Joe N. Chapman of Sulphur Springs and Texas B.E. Masters, president emeritus of Kilgore Junior College, the Texas Board of Education allowed states funds for desegregated school districts. In the small town of Hoxie, Arkansas, where white students outnumbered African American students by a ratio of 99 to 1, dissent for integration rose until the school board suspended classes for fall harvest weeks in advance. Angry parents picketed and boycotted students from school. In New Orleans, Louisiana,  Leander Perez  , a wealthy land owner, lawyer, and judge, was hired by the Orleans Parish School Board to help prevent desegregation. Perez preached that integration was a communist plot to weaken the country, using the slogan “integration is the Southern expression of communism.”  [4]  In Virginia, massive resistance was evident in extreme measures taken by school districts. Funding was eliminated for public schools attempting to integrate. Special privileges were given to white students, including grants to pay tuition for segregated private schools (excluded by Brown v. Board of Education), tax credits granted to parents who sent children to segregated schools, and additional funds were given to transport white students to segregated private schools.  [7]Intimidation &amp; Violence  The Citizens’ Council initially sought to distinguish from the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), but as their movement began to move towards extreme racial disparities, they soon became labeled as the “country club Klan” or “uptown Klan.” Black voter registration fell from 31.7% to 25.7% between 1956 and 1959 due, in part, to intimidation.  [4]  Direct violence committed by the Citizens' Council was hard to find, but the members of the Council often supported violence executed by the KKK.Major Projects and EventsIn efforts to recreate old town meetings locally, the Citizens’ Council movement urged local groups to gather and discuss ways to “meet any crisis by expressing the will of the people.” [8] The Citizens’ Councils of America encouraged local white Americans to disrupt daily living for African Americans and sympathizers. Below are a few examples that occurred:  Mississippi was a crucial state in the segregationist movement. They claimed a membership of 80,000 in 1956. In 1959, the Citizens’ Council played a key role in electing Ross Barnett, a segregationist, to the Governor’s Office.  At a large public meeting on May 17, 1956, the Citizens' Council of Greater New Orleans launched an attack on the Urban League, an integrated organization devoted to developing job opportunities for blacks. Leander Perez attacked the Urban League as ""a communist organization"" and denounced a list of its board members in public.  [4]On February 10, 1956, twelve thousand whites filled the state coliseum in Montgomery at a Citizens’ Council rally featuring Senator James O. Eastland. It was, at that point in time, one of the largest political gatherings in the history of the state. Many rushed to affiliate themselves with the Council after city officials urged the white community to unite against the bus boycott.  [9]In  Little Rock , disruption caused headline news when the local Capital Citizens’ Council interrupted school board meetings, held letter-writing campaigns to the governor urging him to invoke police powers, and raised havoc within the white community for fear of integration.  Central High School  was in the process of being integrated, and with the help of the National Guard, it was – but not without facing Capital Citizens’ Council’s adamant insistence that “forced integration was impractical.”  [10]Analysis and Lessons LearnedThe Citizens' Council, curiously enough, practiced deliberation at the social and analytical process. By conforming to each other’s racist ideals, the Citizens’ Council united under a common fear of integration. Deliberation is the act of interaction between people as they evaluate choices and reach solutions. When members met for their weekly meetings and discussed recent news, deliberation occurred because they tried to address current issues by gathering resources and agreeing on actions to be taken. But why did such a vast movement which shared political thinking fail ? Political Communication and Deliberation , written by John Gastil, explains the necessary components of deliberation. At the analytical level, the spread of information through mass media successfully created a solid information base for users, and clearly identified a set of values that defined the Citizens’ Council. Yet, the organization ultimately failed to continue its influence on society as the progressive civil rights movement was embraced by the rest of the nation. The Citizens’ Council largely focused on the process of enticing members to join instead of following up on results or brainstorming various ways to execute their opinions. At the social level, the Citizens’ Council adequately fulfilled criteria to ensure mutual comprehension, but failed to give the average citizen adequate opportunity to express their experiences to the big leaders that charismatically led the way. The Councils were controlled by the most-rich and most powerful of society. The decline of this organization can also be accredited to the lack of coherent political deliberation.  Groupthink  The Citizens’ Council is a notable organization of deliberation because it fulfills many groupthink proposals. For one, it brought together individuals in society who identified their lifestyles based on a specific set of beliefs. By first creating an identity that related to the movement, the Citizens’ Council could draw more support by easily appealing to their shared views. The Citizens’ Council effectively mobilized the populace at a local level and was able to amplify local opinions about racial segregation so that they were heard at the national level. Though there was a disconnect between states, all of the councils had the same objective to maintain segregation. [13]  Through maintaining stereotyped views of the opposing groups (“African Americans are bad.”) and withholding negative news or flaws to avoid dispute (i.e. not discussing a new civil rights group, not presenting the latest discovery of integration cities, etc.), members of the Citizens’ Council fell into a monotonous duty to their segregationist ideals. Despite the power and effectiveness of groupthink, many also believe it is an explanation for policy disasters. Flawed decisions are inevitable in a groupthink dynamic since no one dares to question a policy strategy or make suggestions.  Lack of Communication  The Citizens’ Council’s eventual demise can also be attributed to its lack of deliberation at the broader societal level. The movement had difficulty working jointly with other states because each council focused solely on matters that could be handled locally. If Councils had formed monthly or semi-annual meetings for all those involved in Citizens’ Councils of America, or even at the state level between cities, the Citizens’ Council may have survived the more revolutionary and progressive civil rights agenda that destroyed the Citizens’ Council.  Political Language  One of the more manipulative tools the Citizens’ Council fostered was the usage of powerful words to manipulate the public at large. Much like the political scientist Murray Edelman described with the word crisis, repetitive usage of the of words like ‘racism’, ‘dirty’, ‘disease’, and other derogatory adjectives for African Americans confused normal citizens enough to the Councils’ advantage. As Edelman pointed out, “crisis language may be used to encourage the...population to accept [the proposed ideas],” and furthermore often “relaxes resistance to governmental interferences with civil liberties and bolsters support for executive actions, including discouragement of suppression of criticism.""  [13]  Such practice was commonly used by the Citizens’ Councils through their campaigns and propaganda, and extremely effective during the organization's earlier years.PublicationsAs the Citizens’ Council spread into other states, many started to use propaganda to spread the message. On October 15, 1955, the Citizens’ Council in Mississippi released the first issue of  The Citizens’ Council , a pro-segregationist newspaper. By 1960, 50,000 copies of the issue were circulating on average, and television and radio broadcasts were also available for program. Other Citizens’ Council pamphlets often carried messages describing African Americans in extremely racist ways, referring to them as having “an inherent deficiency in mental ability” and “a natural indolence.” [11]  The monthly four-page newspaper contained news from area newspapers, essays from advocates, and articles of similar campaigns in South Africa. Both American and African blacks were de-humanized, portrayed as sexual predators, savages, cannibals, and witch doctors incapable of self-control through cartoons and writing.  [5]  The notorious Black Monday title referring to the day of Brown v. Board of Education, was written by  Thomas Pickens Brady , a Mississippi circuit court judge. The handbook became a staple in the Citizens’ Council’s movement.  In 1956, Robert Patterson published a series of five pamphlets. Patterson used powerful politicians to support his main points: incorporated into his pamphlets was an article by former Supreme Court Justice James F. Brynes of South Carolina, a speech by State Attorney General Eugene Cook of Georgia, and addresses by Senator James O. Eastland and Representative John Bell Williams. Patterson went on to publish sets of single-sheet leaflets which claimed that there were statistics to show that crime, illegitimacy, and venereal disease were more prevalent in blacks than whites.  In January 1956, Montgomery Mayor W.A. Gayle joined the Citizens’ Council, publicly declaring that “every right-right thinking white person in Montgomery, Alabama and the South should do the same.” [12]  By February, membership had doubled. Martin Luther King wrote to President Dwight D. Eisenhower asking him to investigate the Citizens’ Council violence.

Budgets are the government’s most powerful tool to meet the needs and priorities of a country and its people. The aim of the IBP is to ensure that government budgets are more immediate to the needs of poor and low-income people in society and, to make budget systems more apparent and responsible to the public.  The IBP believes that the public has a right to wide-ranging, timely, and valuable information on how the government manages public funds. This allows for the identifications of a broad range of solutions. Their experience shows that when ordinary people have a chance to be involved and informed, broader public engagement in government budget processes can promote large improvements in governance and poverty. “In order to foster more open, participatory, and accountable public budgeting, the IBP partners with civil society organizations around the world, leveraging their knowledge of their country’s political context, their experience navigating policy processes for social change, and their relationships with the public in order to transform their country’s budget system.”  [1]What does IBP do? Five Major Steps:  1. Building budget analysis and advocacy skills through training and technical assistance. This allows for education on budgets which helps create a solid information base.  2. Measuring and advancing transparency, accountability, and public participation in the budget process.  3. Contributing to strong and sustainable organizations by providing financial assistance for civil society budget work.  4. Enhancing knowledge exchange among civil society budget groups and other public finance stakeholders by acting as a hub of information on civil society budget work. This helps weigh the pros and cons of each budget work, allowing for the best to be chosen.  5. Building vibrant international and regional budget networks, finding the top possible solutions.  What is the impact of this?  The IBP and civil society organizations that work together hope to contribute on how governments can reform the managing of public funds around the world.  This allows for the budget process (being the proposal of budgets, the deliberative debates on them, how they are implemented and how they are assessed) to be known to the public and how they are able to add input. The needs of the poor and marginalized are effectively addressed by the budget policies and how the budget rules, institutions and regulations are stronger and able to resist corruption and poor management.History  “In 1985 Disha, a civil society organization (CSO) in Gujarat, India, wanted the government to address several issues affecting poor people living in tribal areas, including land rights and support for Tendu leaf-plucker women. Although Disha was well-equipped with economic and moral arguments and were seasoned advocates, they realized that without hard data on how the national and local governments were currently using, and planning to use, public funds to support tribal development, it would be nearly impossible to convince the government to address these issues. So Disha began to gather this data and use it to advocate for stronger policies for poor, tribal people.Thus was born one of the first “budget groups” — CSOs that analyze government budgets and undertake advocacy to influence these budgets in order to improve policies, service delivery, and outcomes, particularly for the poor.”  [1]Why Civil Society Budget Work?  Public budgets are the outlines for how the government will raise and use the public funds needed for the policies and programs. Though the budget directly impacts all of a nation’s people, usually the public has been shut out of the processes through which these decisions are made.  This allows for people from all over to participate, creating an equal deliberative model for expansion in the world. With the help of people around the world, IBP hopes to make the best decision possible for all countries. This attitude has begun to change in the past decade, influenced largely by increasing efforts by civil society organizations to participate in government budget processes in order to affect policy choices and make public budgeting more open and accountable. It is being recognized that when ordinary people are involved in managing the public’s money, you get stronger decisions and better outcomes for the people, especially the poor people.  Two things need to happen to make this work. One: governments need to provide the public with information and chance to participate in the budget process. Two: civil society and the public need the skills to understand and use this information to effectively promote for better plans.  Based on this belief, the International Budget Partnership was formed in 1997 within the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities  [2]  to collaborate with general society to start budget analysis and advocacy in order to improve governance and decrease poverty. The IBP invests in civil society’s capacity to understand and analyze government budgets and participate in budget processes.  “The work of the IBP is fueled by these core assumptions:  • Public understanding and engagement are necessary if public budgeting processes are to be reformed and budgets are to be more responsive.  • Successful CSO engagement requires that citizens have access to information and opportunities to participate in the formulation, implementation, and oversight of public policies and budgets.  • Government has the primary duty to provide the public with timely, comprehensive information on the budget and opportunities for participation in budget processes.  • Government has the primary duty to ensure that the maximum available public funds are devoted to reductions in poverty. Public funds should be spent on public priorities, especially those of the poor and marginalized.”  [1]Activities  IBP’s Electronic Publications – documents and promotes the budget work that is done and the organizations that make it possible. This is a free bimonthly newsletter that anyone can subscribe to. This creates a solid information base for the people that are interested in learning about budget work.  Open Budget Blog/International Budget Listserv – these are both ongoing discussions on current budget issues and people are able to participate and also able to start new feeds. This allows for discussion by all types of people by adequately distributing speaking opportunities. This is a very deliberative means for which people can help others ensure for mutual comprehension while considering other ideas and experiences.Funding  The International Budget Partnership collaborates with a large and diverse network of civil society organizations (CSOs) around the world. The IBP — through the Partnership Initiative (PI), the Open Budget Initiative (OBI), and the Training Program — provides re-grants and technical assistance to a wide range of organizations. “All together, during 2009, the IBP made grants totaling $1,929,000 to 47 organizations in 33 countries, plus an additional $825,000 in pass-through grants to two organizations.”  [3]The IBP also provides a number of smaller grants to strengthen support. These grants contribute to a coordinated campaign within and across countries, but with a narrower focus than the Partnership Initiative. The Open Budget Initiative seeks, in now close to 100 countries, greater transparency in government budgets and greater government accountability for the effective use of scarce public resources.  The financial support IBP provides goes to a diverse group of organizations. Some, such as Fundar in Mexico or Ibase in Brazil highly capable CSOs that use budget analysis in pursuit of broad national-level policy goals. Others, such as HakiElimu in Tanzania and the Omar Asghar Khan Foundation in Pakistan, got their start with a focus on a single sector and have gradually expanded their work from that foundation.  Major Donors:  Ford Foundation  Open Society Institute  William and Flora Hewlett FoundationMajor Projects  Open Budget Survey 2010 The Open Budget Survey is the only independent, comparative, and regular measure of budget transparency and accountability around the world. The 2010 Survey finds that 74 of the 94 countries assessed fail to meet basic standards of precision and accountability with national budgets. This opens the door to abuse and inappropriate and inefficient use of public money. However, the 2010 Survey also reveals that improvement can, and has happened, in a relatively short time period and in some of most challenging contexts.References↑  1.01.11.2  [  http://www.internationalbudget.org/who-we-are/  International Budget Partnership (Who We Are)]↑Center on Budget and Policy Priorities↑International Budget Partnership (Funding)Secondary Sources  Child Friendly Budgets for 2010 and Beyond -  http://www.unicef.org/socialpolicy/files/Global_Economic_Crisis_Cambodia.pdf""Fiscal Transparency - Self-Evaluation Report.""

For elementary schools, the councils consist of eleven members who are one principal, six parent representatives, two community representatives, and two teacher representatives. [1] For high schools, and councils consist of twelve members which are the principal, six parent representatives, two community representatives, two teacher representatives, and one student representative. However, in high school councils, the student representative is not allowed to vote on personnel matters such as contractual agreements, evaluation retention, principal selection, and the allocation of teaching and staff resources.  School-Based Budget  LSCs help develop and approve a school budget, with major control over an average of $500,000 per year in flexible funds from the state. [2]Member Eligibility  In order to be a member of a Chicago Local School Council (LSC), you must be either a parent or community member of the schools and fill out an application. The members are elected or nominated by parents and community residence in an election that takes place every two years. [1] The applications that future members are required to fill out, call for them to include basic information such as name, date of birth, address and how many children of theirs attending the school; as well as their children’s birth date and classroom. Candidates are also required to have two forms of identification and show their economic interests; such as if they are related to the principal and if they or any family member or relatives do business with the school. This is done at the time in which they are applying to be a member of the council. This shows if the applicant may have any outside interest in becoming a member aside from improving the schools.  Further description of what qualifies candidates to be eligible for these positions is given.  Principal  -The Principal, whether contractual, acting, or interim, is automatically a member of their school’s LSC.  Parent representative  A parent representative is eligible to serve on an LSC if he/she:  -Is the parent or legal guardian of a child currently enrolled in that school; and  -is not an employee of the Board. [1]  Community representative  A community representative is eligible to serve on an LSC if he/she:  -Resides in the attendance area or voting district of that school.  -Does not have a child currently enrolled at that school and is not an employee of the Board. [1]  Teacher representative  A teacher representative is eligible to serve on an LSC if he/she:  -Is employed and assigned in a teaching position or in a position for which qualifications as a teacher are required; and  -is employed to perform the majority of his/her employment duties at the attendance center. [1]  Student representative  A student representative is eligible to serve on the LSC if he/she is a full-time high school student. [1] Additional LSC information  -Relatives of the principal are ineligible to serve on the LSC.  -Individuals who have been convicted of certain felony crimes are ineligible to serve, either indefinitely or for 10 years after the date of conviction.  -Appointed or elected LSC members may be seated immediately with FULL LSC voting privileges pending the completion of their criminal background checks. [1]Meeting Structure  Most LSCs meet monthly, and the date, time, and location of these meetings posted.  One great part of these meetings is that they are open to the public. This allows parents, teachers, students, and community members who are not part of the councils to at least be informed of what is happening within their schools. This is a great aspect of the organization in relation to deliberation because, again, it allows for a wide variety of opinions and views. This also creates a space where the attending public to make comments about the topics at hand. Also, comments from people in attendance can provide other solutions that the council members may not have previously thought of. The public can voice their opinions of what their main concerns are as well. This feature of the council contributes to the social aspect of deliberation because all people in attendance have an opportunity to give their thoughts and concerns, and it allows people to consider the ideas and experiences of others.  Not all meetings however, are open to the public. These closed meetings are ones that discuss matters along the lines of personnel, discipline issues, and safety.  The LSCs are required to hold at least two meetings that are open to the public specifically to present and discuss the annual school improvement plan, proposals to the budget, and present a report on the progress of the school and students.History  In 1988 the Chicago School Reform Act passed, which created the Local School Councils, as well as sub district councils, School Board Nominating Commission, and Mayor-appointed interim board. The first election for the first Local School Council was held in October of 1989. 17,256 people ran, 312,000 voted, and 6,000 members were elected to serve. [1] Since then, the LSC voting process was declared unconstitutional in 1990 due to the suspicion of corrupt council members; thus a new election process was created and altered throughout the years. In 1995 a new requirement was implemented in which incoming LSC members were required to take three days of training. This was to make sure each member knew their duty and what they would be deliberating on. In 1996 the CPS acquired the ability to set criteria for principal positions. Three years later in 1999, the CPS system was restructured, and LSC members would have to go through criminal background checks, and members no longer had to file Statement of Economic Interest with Cook County. [1] Today, LSCs meetings are taken very seriously and its members do the best they can for their local schools.Major Projects and Events  The LSC meets on a regular basis discussing the hire of their school’s principal on a four-year performance contract, set priorities for school improvement, and determine the school’s budget. The typical LSC meets monthly and nearly always has a quorum. The average parent or community LSC member devotes 28 hours per month to helping their school. [2] To build on the strengths of Chicago’s LSCs and overcome weaknesses, those committed to the Chicago schools have taken major actions to change the ways in which LSCs are currently treated and educated: Central office staff had been interfering inappropriately in LSC decision making, often pursuing their own political agendas. LSCs and their supporters have included a wider variety of people to stop these abuses and build LSCs capability. The process for educating and assisting LSCs is used to stop the violation of widely recognized standards for effective adult education. [2]  Now the LSC has a number of instructional learning sessions required for local school council members. These sessions are used to enhance their knowledge of how LSCs operate and their role as a LSC member. [1] An 18 hour training program must be completed with in six months of a council member taking office. The Board is in charge of monitoring this training, and if an LSC member fails to complete the required program with in the designated six month time period, the Board will declare his or her position vacant. The LSC will then appoint a qualified person who meets the eligibility requirements to fill the unexpired term. [1]  There are six mandatory lessons (12 hours) that LSC members have to take. The additional 3 lessons can come from a variety of topics approved by the Board. The six mandatory lessons are: [1]  • Roles and Responsibilities as Policy Makers  • Effective Local School Councils  • School Improvement Planning for Advancing Academic Achievement  • Budget  • Principal Performance Evaluation  • Principal Retention and Principal Selection  The process of teaching those who are in the council contributes the making the council more deliberative a whole. This creates a strong information base for the members and allows the council to perform to the best of their ability. Once the council members have gone through the mandatory sessions within the six month period, council members are able to make the best decisions possible for the local schools.Funding  Local School Councils are run by faculty, staff, parents and students. These are all people who are there strictly to make a difference in their local schools and not for profit. Being volunteers, there is no organized funding for this organization. The LSCs are a representation of those involved in Chicago’s local school districts.Analysis and Critique  In this section there will be statements showing how the Chicago LSCs are doing well portraying a deliberative process. There will also be critiques and suggestions stating how the Chicago LSCs are not ideally deliberative and how a council could improve.  Analysis  There are several ways that the Chicago LSCs are deliberative. First, it allows for differing points of view from community members, parents, principals, teachers, and at the high school level, students as well. The restrictions on eligibility are necessary to have in place so that only people, who have the ability to make an impact on local schools, are the ones who have a direct connection with the schools. Whether they live in the area of one of the schools, they are an employee of the school, or are a parent of a student attending the school, or students themselves, they can make a difference. The ability for such a variety of people to become involved with these LSCs is also a strong point in the deliberative process, as it allows for lots of different and contrasting viewpoints. Not only older, more experienced members of the public, but the youth that actually attend the schools (high schools) can be elected and have a voice as well.  This also allows the members to identify a broad range of solutions to the issues that the councils deal with, such as budget allocation and future planning. Teachers who have been in the education system have seen where budgeting has gone and can have a great input on where it needs to go. Students can also chime in to where they would like to see their schools budget go and what their peers would participate in or enjoy having in their school. Parents can make suggestions on what they may or may not want their kids being influenced by where the budget is being spent. Citizens in the area can voice their opinions on what improvements they may want to see in the local schools. Principals are also important for regulating what planning solutions are actually plausible. This group together, can come up with a variety of solutions and make the best decision possible for that particular location.  Local School Council members are now more educated in the job that they are carrying out. Because everyone that enters the council takes the same required classes there is less room for misunderstanding during deliberation. This requirement ensures that there is mutual comprehension between members, yet there is still a variety of ideas and experiences.  Critique  An improvement that could be made to make this organization more deliberative would be to open it up to more members. As of now, only council participation number maxes out at eleven members for elementary schools and twelve members for high schools. The restrictions on eligibility could remain the same, as to keep those who are relevant in the running. However, adding more members could also provide more viewpoints, allowing the councils to come to even more educated, well rounded, and beneficial decisions on the issues. Currently, high school LSCs are restricted to only twelve members, one of which is a student at the school. While the variety of members is a great resource, more members in general could provide an even greater benefit for the organization; especially more students and teachers. These are the people who have the first hand experience of what goes on in the school and know what needs improvement. Similarly, schools below the high school level are currently only allowed eleven members; none of which are students. Allowing more input from parents, teachers, and community members could provide a great benefit to the organization.  At this point LSCs are run by volunteers and thus are a nonprofit organization. Although a high percentage of LSCs are up and running smoothly, 4% of Chicago’s LSCs are practically inactive and 13% are very inconsistent with actually performing their most basic responsibilities. [2] This creates for a very unsuccessful or nonexistent deliberative process. If there were some sort of system put in place to make people want to volunteer there would be more people volunteering in these low functioning councils. If a rule were put in place that made there be a new council member in each spot (beside teachers and the principal) every tow years, instead of just another election. The rule would provide a wider variety of people that would have to volunteer and there would be a greater turnover in member volunteering. This would give new people a chance to make a difference in the local school system and discourage unethical behavior from taking place. With new members comes a new wave of fresh ideas and more experiences; a better deliberative process.PublicationsExtra Linkshttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_School_Councilshttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_schools_in_Chicago_Public_Schoolshttp://piccolo.cps.k12.il.us/local_school_council.htmhttp://www.edline.net/pages/Whitney_M_Young_Magnet_HS/-Parent_Group/Local_School_CouncilSecondary Sourceshttp://www.Designforchange.orghttp://www.catalyst-chicago.org/index.phphttp://blogs.suntimes.com/backtalk/2010/03/your_local_school_council_need.htmlhttp://austintalks.org/2010/11/douglass-local-school-council-members-brace-for-change/NotesBibliography  [1] Chicago Public Schools.

They are concerned with what the citizens in our country are concerned with, and in turn focus on these issues. A question that has driven their research today is: “What does it take to make democracy work as it should?” They focus on the importance of citizens taking an active role to make political practices more deliberative. Their research is unique because it really puts people in the forefront. They strive to explore what people can do to address different problems in their community and also at a national level. There are three hypotheses, which are used in all of Kettering’s research. These hypotheses state that democracy requires: “Citizens who as “sovereigns” can make sound decisions about public issues.” “Citizens who can act together to deal with their problems beginning in their communities.” “Citizens who can align the work they do with the institutions they created to serve them so that civic initiatives reinforce institutional efforts.”http://www.kettering.org/about_the_foundationPurpose  The Kettering Foundation is run on continuing to uncover more information through different aspects of research. There are six different research programs, which they work on conjointly to help ensure that democracy is working, as it should. These programs draw from the experiences of citizens in our country when they are able to get involved and work within their communities The six programs are: Citizens and Public Choice, Community Politics, Public-Public Education, Public-Government Relationship, Institutions And Professions In The Public Realm and Multinational Research. The first program is based on citizens and public choice. They look at how citizens can make a collective actions and decisions with sound judgment, which ensures a more deliberative process. Kettering feels that people will be more inclined to take accountability for decisions that they make on their own. The Kettering foundation spreads the word by issuing books on different issues; people can then use these books as resources so they can make more deliberative decisions on different issues. The next program focuses on all of the aspects of community politics. This ranges from how to address problems as citizens and also how to make decisions on different issues in the community. They really put an emphasis on the importance of citizen involvement in the community. There is another program that researches public-to-public education. This research really displays the importance of citizens taking responsibility and ownership of the education we offer our children. The next research program is based on the public to government relationship. Many citizens looking from the outside sometimes feel that the political system is driven by special interests from the government. The relationship between the citizens and government are examined and the research also sees if the work of government can support their work to the citizens. Kettering also has a research program, which examines how institutions and professions can connect to the citizens in a democratic way. It dwells into how the practices of institutions and professions can support the citizens in a more democratic fashion. They also contribute by doing multinational research; they are able to work with many countries. They spend time learning from people around the world about their own personal feelings on their own individual governments. The research also tries to discover how people feel that their country should be run; in what they believe to be is more democratic.http://www.kettering.org/foundation_programsHistory  The foundation is named after Charles Kettering and was founded in 1927 ""to sponsor and carry out scientific research for the benefit of humanity."" The American born Charles F. Kettering founded Kettering based on his positive outlook and thinking. It was built on his inspiration and philosophical approach. Today, the foundation has increased the scope of research to many different areas like improving democracy and education. During the 1960’s many new areas of concern were brought up and used for research. These concerns included improving public education and the relationship with the government and public. One of the most important projects the foundation began to work on was called the Institute for Development of Educational Activities, Inc. The purpose was to improve education so that the younger generations could receive a better way of being taught. One of the most important events involved with this was the Dartmouth Conferences, “a series of high level discussions between prominent citizens of the U.S. and USSR, which the foundation began to cosponsor in 1969.” The foundation went private in the 1970’s and decided to operate in a different manner. There was a change in how the foundation was run and this was from the idea that the foundation would stop making grants. The foundation decided it would be a better idea to perform research on its own. They began to focus their research on areas such as: “education, urban affairs, science and technology, and international relations.” The evidence which the foundation is uncovering is that the issues in our world have more connection to resolutions that stem from practices in a social sense. They have begun to realize that many problems we face aren’t necessarily in need of new age technology; rather that they can be faced through politics. This again, draws what the foundation really cares about, and this is the citizen. Kettering is researching the ways in which the individual can get involved and help improve democracy in the world.http://www.kettering.org/about_the_foundation/historyProjects and Events  The Kettering foundation’s focus on education and research is represented in the types of projects the foundation undertakes. The foundation produces periodicals, collaborates with other institutions such as the National Issues Forums, and sponsors numerous publications that aim at informing the public of relevant national issues.  Many institutions have used of the research that the Kettering Foundation has conducted. The foundation has had the opportunity to conduct experiments in the state of Hawaii. This research was initiated by the legislature who wanted a group at the university to research the information that is available how citizens evaluate issues in a deliberative matter before the general assembly. This research is crucial because it evaluates the reasoning citizens have when evaluating issues. The government can also understand what it is that is important to citizens and how they will evaluate issues when they do arise.http://www.kettering.orgPeriodicals  There are three annual periodicals that the Kettering Foundation produces and distributes:  Connections is an annual newsletter that focuses on one specific program area that the Foundation finds important. Editing of the newsletter rotates among the Kettering Foundation staff. This allows for the information and viewpoints to change and the influences printed in the letter to never be monopolized by one view. The contents of each newsletter include book reviews, articles and stories pertaining to the focus discussion.  The Kettering Review is a periodical dedicated to improving American public life and democracy. This publication presents ideas and activities aimed at starting public discussion and initiating large-scale involvement in civic deliberation. The Kettering Foundation explains that, each issue addresses a single theme, including the changing roles of the citizen, the press, public leadership, and public opinion. Contributors include a diverse group of American and international educators, historians, philosophers, and social and political scientists.  The Higher Education Exchange is a periodical that focuses on ways that students and instructors can start and keep ongoing discussions about public life. The Foundation found inspiration for the periodical in the following quote by Thomas Jefferson, “I know no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves; and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them, but to inform their discretion by education.” The foundation believes that the purpose of higher education is to provide students with a foundation for living a productive and successful public life. This includes a definitive understanding of democracy and how deliberation improves not only democratic ideals but civic life also.http://www.kettering.org/media_roomSpecialization  The Kettering Foundation stands out because of their unique research in which the conduct. They want their research to be focused from the eyes of citizens. This means they are primarily concerned with how people evaluate issues and what can be done. Kettering promotes the advancement of democracy in hopes to make it a better system for citizens. They hope to see that people can make a change at a micro-level, in terms of being involved in their own communities.http://www.kettering.org/about_the_foundation/what_we_doFunding  The Kettering Foundation was originally funded by a private endowment from Charles F. Kettering. The initial purpose of the foundation was to use scientific research as a platform to improve humanity. Over time the foundation expanded its research and also the endowment. The funding for the foundation currently estimated at $270 million is invested in many assets. These investments provide funding for the research programs and interests the Kettering Foundation sponsors. Also the foundation’s annual budget is reflective of the market and the current net worth of the company’s assets and investments.  Some examples of other organizations the Kettering foundation collaborates with both financially and through research are: The Harwood Institute for Public Innovation, International Civil Society Consortium, International Institute For Sustained Dialogue, National Issues Forums Institute, Public Agenda, and Sustained Dialogue Campus Network. These partner organizations allow the Kettering Foundation to diversify their funding and invest in multiple research ventures.  -Kettering Washington D.C. Headquarters -Businessweek Magazine - http://www.kettering.orgPublications  Publications are a large part of the Kettering Foundations focus. The foundation displays a number of articles, essays, books, and studies on their web site for people to read and examine. Kettering Foundation staff and partners alike write these publications. Each publication focuses on issues like citizen engagement, education, politics, international discourse, community leadership and deliberation.  Readers Forum: The readers forum is a section on the Kettering Foundation’s website that allows visitors to read discussion pieces and write comments about their own opinions. This portion of the website aims at extending deliberation to the online user and opening the zone of influence not only to those who participate in face-to-face discussions but also those who utilize internet forums.  Abstracts: The abstracts portion of the website is a collection of over 15000 articles and essays written by Kettering Foundation staff. These articles cover the six core programs of the Foundation: Public Choice, Public/Government, Community Politics, Public/ Public Education, Institutions and Professions, and Multinational Research.  Video and Podcast: The Kettering foundation provides videos and podcasts (series of videos or audio files) that visitors can use to research issues and as building blocks for the start of discussions. The videos are reflective of current issues and possible future issues of public concern.http://www.kettering.org/media_roomPartners  The Kettering Foundation has six major partners that they collaborate with to further their research and educational goals. Each of these organizations allows the Foundation to search for betters ways of living democratically.The Harwood Institute For Public Innovation :  A nonpartisan nonprofit organization that focuses on improving public life and politics. The Institute was established in 1988 by Richard Harwood. The institutions main focus is on ways to improve civic involvement and understand how communities change socially and politically.International Civil Society Consortium :  A group of civic nonprofit organizations that network to promote productive democratic institutions and practices as well as enhance deliberation.International Institute for Sustained Dialogue :  Institution founded in conjunction with the Kettering Foundation. The IISD was developed to dissolve racial and ethnic conflicts internationally.National Issues Forum :  Non-partisan institution developed in 1989 to promote the Nation Issues Forum. The Institute is a network of organizations concerned with promoting and improving civic deliberation in the United States.Public Agenda :  Organization used to shrink the gap between policy makers and citizens. Public Agenda focuses on informing the American public of issues by providing discussion forums in communities throughout the United States. For twenty-five years the organization has tackled important American issues such as foreign policy, international relations, public education etc.Sustained Dialogue Campus Network :  Network of students from college campuses around the United States that attempt to make their campuses more cohesive. The mission of the organization is to train and mentor student leaders who will mediate campus interactions and influence other students to create more engaged and diverse groups.http://www.kettering.orgCritique and Evaluation of Foundation and Deliberative Nature  The Kettering Foundation expects citizens to achieve a deliberative democracy by following three “hypothesizes”. The first being Citizens who as “sovereigns” can make sound decisions about public issues, the second: Citizens who can act together to deal with their problems, beginning in their communities, and lastly: Citizens who can align the work they do with the institutions they created to serve them so that civic initiatives reinforce institutional efforts (Kettering Foundation Website). These three “hypothesizes” are all viable to expect a deliberative community to function. This foundation is one that focuses not on implementing deliberation, rather researches how deliberation can become more affective in our communities from the citizens’ perspective. The Kettering Foundation follows the “Three Criteria for the Democratic Process” (Gastil, PCD, 2008) which are inclusion, participation opportunities, and enlightened understanding. Inclusion is attained by researching not only governmental examples of deliberation, but the educational system and how to maintain deliberation in schools. Participation opportunities are achieved not only on the employment level but participating in studies as well. The Kettering Foundation provides many possibilities for people of different backgrounds to participate in their studies and provide input as to how deliberation can be accomplished. Foundation programs range from public programs on education and community politics to multinational research where deliberation is evaluated overseas. In terms of enlightened understanding the goal to learn how to study issues and reflect carefully on their values, is reached by results that the Kettering Foundation posts to the citizens’. These findings that are discovered through their research are published to the public through various types of media such as research reports, books, occasional papers, and videos posted on this Web site; The Kettering Review, The Higher Education Exchange, and Connections are examples of research findings that The Kettering Foundation places into periodicals. The guides and publications that are produced by this large foundation are not only used by officially sponsored events, but by local community organizers as well ( http://eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED510122.pdf ). Information published in these guides is available to the general public, making sure that each person has an equal opportunity to understand how to accomplish correct deliberation.  The National Issues Forums has been a central figure in terms of attaining deliberation. This discussion program that has been a milestone for decades has been a key partner with the Kettering Foundation. The partnership that has developed between these two organizations has created remarkable improvements of reaching the deliberation standards. There is a massive amount of positivity being conveyed from many organizations and people about the Kettering Foundation and the NIF working together, “The National Issues Forums, with the encouragement of the Kettering Foundation, has refined and enriched the discussion group methodology” ( http://www.viewpointlearning.org/publications/articles/kettering_fall06.pdf ). The next event will take place in spring of 2011; the two organizations collaborated to create a program to address economic security on the national, state, and local level (nifi.org). The effectiveness of the Kettering Foundation on increasing the quality of deliberation is noticed by the largest organizations worldwide, that is why they are constantly in demand of other organizations. A second example of the guide being used was when discussing the term “achievement gap” and evaluating the context and meaning of the phrase. The guide was able to allow diverse participants to talk openly about the issue and eventually the participants were able to find common ground and work through strategies of improvement to be implemented to the connotation of the phrase “achievement gap” ( http://eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED510122.pdf ). Kettering Foundation is able to achieve deliberation not only through organizations and events that are sponsored by them, but by producing these useful guides. These guides are extremely constructive and very deliberative as they direct citizens how to facilitate meetings.  Overall the Kettering Foundation is at one of the highest levels possible in terms of promoting deliberation. This promotion of deliberation is not just to community members, but to government officials as well. The guides that are produced are utilized by many different markets of people; therefore their spread of the concept, deliberation, is vital to continue to allow deliberation to grow. The organization as a whole is promoting deliberation at the highest level possible. The Kettering Foundation does not only focus on government, but education, communities, and race as well, reaching a very wide market of people. The Kettering Foundation is an organization that is noticed by many of the top professionals in the deliberation field.Secondary Sourceshttp://eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED510122.pdf  = (Flono, Fannie. 2010.

 oD Russia (also known as openDemocracy Russia) is an independent news and media group overseen by the deliberative media project, OpenDemocracy.net, for the purposes of expanding deliberation and meaningful discussion over relevant topics of political, economic, and cultural significance within Russia and the post-Soviet region. Overseen by OpenDemocracy.net and its advisory board (yet edited and conducted by an independent panel with relevant expertise to the region), the organization incorporates news, blogs, and opinions from a broad spectrum of sources and intellectual camps onto the oD Russia website, with the aim of fostering a platform for more comprehensive information gathering, value orienting, and deliberation to occur for those who are otherwise only exposed to less deliberative media sources on the relevant topics in the region. More elegantly stated by oD Russia’s founder editors Susan Richards and Zygmunt Dzieciolowski, “openDemocracy Russia offers a thoughtful platform for people concerned about the future of Russia and her desire to establish a new place in the world.” (1) 
 Origins and Development Know the events surrounding this organization’s development? Help us complete this section!Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 oD Russia utilizes a number of main stream news sources, as well as more marginalized opinion sources, when compiling the totality of its presented media. Of particular note is the Moscow ezine polit.ru, for which oD Russia claims is ”at the core of openDemocracy Russia's offering[s]” (1). However, oD Russia also has distributing partnerships with openspace.ru, an internet magazine dedicated to Russian culture, and the Levada Center, a Russian survey research group which conducts regular polls on all aspects of Russian life. Among the list of individual contributors to the website include Floriana Fossato, “a former Moscow correspondent for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty”, Maria Lipman, a “fellow of the Carnegie Moscow Centre”, Andrei Zorin, “a professor of Russian and Fellow of New College, Oxford”, and a much more extensive list of various authors, journalists, and academics who volunteer their work on a list consistent basis. (1) 
 oD Russia’s funding comes from the general openDemocracy budget. According to the OpenDemocracy website, “[half of the grants are] for special projects and sections … including oD Russia” (3). Of the $823,675 which makes up the entirety of openDemocracy’s annual budget, 87% comes from special grants. The 2010 major contributors to the openDemocracy and editorial projects included: The Barrow Cadbury Trust,The Charles E Chadwyck-Healey Charitable Trust, David &amp; Elaine Potter Charitable Foundation, Hivos, The Open Society Institute, The Open Trust, The Tedworth Charitable Trust, Heinrich Boell Foundation, Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust,and John Jackson (3). The maximum amount from these grants directly contributed to oD Russia and its project execution is $716,597. However, oD Russia also has access to the rest of the openDemocracy budget, which is derived from reader donations, books and publications, and advertising and republishing, at 5%, 6%, and 2% respectively (3). Most of the books and publications proceeds come from the openDemocracy Amazon.com store section, for which “all purchases from [the store section] and any search on Amazon starting [there] earn’s OPENDEMOCRACY referral fees” (4). Reader donations are made available at multiple junctions through-out both the openDemocracy main site and the oD Russia site alike. The advertising and republishing appears to result largely out of the republishing and information sharing partnership oD Russia has with polit.ru. 
 Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 Among the topics for which oD Russia reports on are “conflict, culture, economy, environment, foreign, history, human rights, internal, law and order, media, politics, and religion” (1). Users are able to either utilize the main page’s “front page,” which displays the most viewed and promoted topics for the day, or search for news and opinion under the specific sections listed above. Also available is the option to search region-specifically, including sections for news and opinion under Abkhazia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan (1). Of particular note is oD Russia’s recognition of Abkhazia as a legitimized nation, an otherwise controversial question of legitimacy, as the region is only recognized by Russia, Nicaraugua, Venezuela, Naura, and the unrecognized national entities of South Ossetia and Transnistria (2). News and opinion are reported under of these sections from a wide spectrum of sources and opinions, often times presenting both sides of an issues arguments, with the ability for users to then comment and continue the discussion using the websites comment forum. oD Russia also has a Facebook fan group and Twitter account, allowing for users to integrate the oD Russia media and deliberation into their social networks. Finally, oD Russia contributes to the printed publishing’s of the openDemocracy network, for which a notable portion of the entirety of the openDemocracy budget is derived. Role and Context in Russian Media ClimateoD Russia plays a unique role in the media climate of Russia. Unlike other western nations, the media in Russia and the post-Soviet region is largely regulated and concentrated, although admittedly not to the extent that occurred during the Soviet period. Like other industries that went through privatization after the fall of the Soviet Union, the media in the region was quickly re-centralized into the hands of elite former party members, parties, and business’ oligarchs due to the process of voucher privatization. Telecommunications was not even fully de-nationalized until late in the 1990’s. During this period, acquisition of media holdings became increasingly important, as “the role of the [emerging parties] was determined by media holdings” (5) This climate resulted in the current media environment, where in Vladimir Putin and the United Russia political party has implemented drastic restrictions on the ability of news outlets to report on all political matters, and the total number of news sources available to the public pales in comparison to similar Western nations (5). 
 Further, the lack of progress Russian news publishers have made in utilizing new media channels, such as the internet, compared to world news sources is of particular note. Due to lack of infrastructure, a majority of Russians are still without high-speed internet access in their homes. As such, the motivation for producing Russo-centric news, and there by taking advantage of the internet’s deliberative advantage, is lacking. Still, even that news which is made available on the internet is more often than not simply the replication of paper sources. One estimate places the figure for the percentage of all internet media being simple replications of paper sources at about 70% (5). 
 oD Russia is unique in the Russian media market in that it focuses on obtaining multiple opinions and input on given topics and that it is almost strictly an online news source, encouraging users to engage the topic discussions actively. The ability to not only publish dissenting opinions on otherwise uniform Russian opinion/official Kremlin position, but as well voice unadulterated support for these positions, makes oD Russia a unique media platform in the Russian media environment. Ultimately, it is these qualities which make this otherwise un-noteworthy online news source impactful and critical to the landscape of its target audience. 
 Major Projects and Events Know what projects or events this organization has lead or supported? Help us complete this section!Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 oD Russia’s deliberative quality can be determined using Dr. John Gastil’s five analytical criteria for deliberation: providing a solid information base, prioritizing values, brainstorming a broad range of solutions, weighing pros and cons, and finally making the best decision possible (6). oD Russia excels considerably in the first two steps of establishing information and orienting values. Considering the fact that most Russians gain their news from only one two sources, oD Russia’s emphasis on covering a multiplicity of different types of stories, especially those not being covered anywhere else, contributes greatly to the ability of its users to deliberate further. Similarly, oD Russia excels greatly in helping users orient their values further by compiling opinions and editorials from multiple different ideological camps on the stories being covered. In doing so, users of oD Russia become more acquainted with different thought and analytical patterns, helping them establish an opinion and ideology to utilize in further discussion. The other three deliberative steps are emphasized to a lesser extent by oD Russia. While the website offers a forum for users to comment on the stories and editorials they read, the platform is not set up in a Socratic format, but rather a narrative one. Conceivably, users are able to engage in direct discussion on the website, although admittedly this is not the primary mission or purpose of program. Rather, oD Russia is a tool for which to help otherwise uninformed Russians begin the process of establishing the knowledge and values to engage in deliberation through other mediums. Especially considering the media environment of Russia and the post-Soviet region, oD Russia’s simple contribution and aim of allowing for a more democratic and deliberative civil society to flourish is commendable. While the platform is not directly a deliberative one, its value as a tool to the people of the region is unparalleled.

The overarching objective from DEMO-net.org is to strengthen scientific, technological and social research excellence in eParticipation by integrating the research capacities of individuals and organizations spread across Europe. A more detailed definition of e-participation is ""the use of information and communication technologies to broaden and deepen political participation by enabling citizens to connect with one another and with their elected representatives"" (Macintosh 2004). This research will help coordinate the framework involved in eParticipitation by connecting leading European organizations to pool together research regarding current political practices.Purpose and MissionThe main issues covered in this research focus on the lack of involvement with current politics. This organization wishes to develop tools that will help promote political involvement by integrating current research with eParticipation. DEMO-net plans on advancing the research involved by achieving active citizenship and reducing voter disinterest. DEMO-net puts together research information and resources for hundreds of people to use. Pages include resources for practitioners, researchers and PhD students. There is also a page that allows for practitioner stakeholders to engage in eParticipation. With all resources given to participants, the programme is designed to pool together all information pertaining to the lack of citizen interest with politics. In order to fulfill all goals set forth by the European Council, DEMO-net has established three high-level research objectives. These objectives are:Objective 1: Establish a large amount of easily accessible material relating to the research and information regarding eParticipation that will be helpful for European policy making. 1.1 Acquire research information provided from a wide variety of viewpoints in order to view opposing objectives. 1.2 Use relevant sources that will provide evidence to support solid decision making for both policy-makers and practitioners.Objective 2: Investigate what is responsible for limiting eParticipation across Europe. 2.1 Analyze conversational techniques to discover what needs to be done and what alliances need to be build at different levels. 2.2 Research future and current eParticipation technological infrastructures and methods.Objective 3: Develop a set of criteria that can be easily adopted by future eParticipation initiatives across Europe. 3.1 Design a way for concepts and terminologies to be organized from both academic disciplines involved and non-academic stakeholders.HistoryDEMO-net started up Janurary 1, 2006. It was created by the European Commision’s sixth framework programme as one of the Network of excellence research projects and is expected to run for four years. The European Commission comes from one of the five key institutions created in the supranatural European Union community system. The proposal for commission came from Robert Schuman, a French Minister on May 9th, 1950. The first commission that originated in 1951 was the nine member “high authority.” Two communities were added in 1958 with the Treaties of Rome. These three bodies existed as the European executives until July 1st, 1967 when the Merger Treaty was signed. Currently the Commission is comprised of a college of Commissioners. There are 27 members total including the President and vice-presidents. They are responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, and general running of the Union. Under the signing of the Amsterdam Treaty on October 2nd, 1997, conducting research institutions and implementing European research programmes became an obligation. With this, The Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development were revised to receive more funding than when the Framework Programmes began in 1984. The Sixth Framework Programme was the beginning of funding for the creation of DEMO-net. It was started up as one of the Programme’s Network of Excellence research projects. This Programme’s main objective was to contribute to the European Research Area. DEMO-net was then designed to help with research regarding eParticipation and the lack of citizen involvement in current politics. The current project coordinator is Professor Ann Macintosh from the Institute of Communications Studies at the University of Leeds in Leeds, United Kingdom. Since it’s founding in 2006, DEMO-net has been able to host over 100 events and continues to research eParticipation with roughly 727 active users.Specializations and ActivitiesFour different strategies are integrated into DEMO-net activities. These strategies include:1. Integration Activities- The integration activities are designed to bring together many varying research topics from all over Europe. The goal is to strengthen national Centers of Excellence by allowing research to be gained from differing disciplinary boundaries. Activities that took place were researcher integration, workshops between institutions, PhD student seminars, exchange programs for students, student field studies, and the creation of a European eParticiparion portal. Each of these activities took place in different workpackages, or WPs. There were a total of 12 for integration.2. Joint Research Activities- This programme was designed to bring together 12 diverse areas to provide a common platform for research. It focused its ideas on issues regarding the community and excellence in European eParticipation. Some activities include: gap analysis and roadmapping, study of eParticipation tools and methods, communication analysis, vital communities, evaluation methods, and emerging standards and business models. This consisted of 14 different workpackages all focusing on different activities.3. Spreading of Excellence- Ensures that the Network of Excellence is the main focus between all connecting networks to generate knowledge to stakeholders and decision-makers while collecting important feedback to contribute to the network’s research agenda. The spreading of excellence activities include: community and partnership building, sustainable innovation methods within public sector, regional and national seminars for eParticipation decision making, publication of all research, and conferences and seminars.4. Network Management- Ensures professional management of the network by evaluation of risk management and careful planning by creating a management technical infrastructure. Activities include: financial coordination, planning and control of activities, risk assessment and project evaluations. The goal is to ensure a high quality of management in the network.Major Projects and EventsDEMO-net is organized to provide many events covering various countries in Europe. It offers the support to build a solid structural system in order to mobilize researchers around Europe and strengthens the connection between academics and government organizations. There are 19 head partners involved in DEMO-net with multiple locations across Europe. Hundreds of practitioners, researchers, and PhD students are also involved in contributing to the research. In order for successful research between differing demographics, many different types of events must occur. Since it started in 2006, DEMO-net archives list 123 events to have taken place. Among these events are committee meetings, many international conferences regarding topics such as voting and eDemocracy, online deliberations, seminars, workshops, networking sessions, colloquiums, symposiums, and forums. The council of Europe forum for future of democracy is an event contributing to debates regarding research information. DEMO-net also features the eGovernment days. The 8th annual was held in Prague in April, 2010. This event provides a solid platform for the exchange of diverse and creative ideas between European countries. It also inspires technology transfer between eastern and western Europe.  www.demo-net.org  provides a map and information for all upcoming events.FundingDEMO-net is funded under the European Commission's sixth framework programme: Information Society Technologies IS. The sixth framework programme (FP6) is one of seven framework programmes set up by the European Union to fund research and technological development for European advancement. The European Union provides funding for the Framework Programmes with the idea that they will provide a high investment return in the future. Putting money into research will help the European economy in years to come. The overall budget for the Sixth Framework Programme during the four year period from 3003-2006 was €17.5 billion. DEMO-net was given a four year budget of €6 million starting on January 1, 2006 leaving them with a $1.9 million U.S. annual budget. The seventh Framework Programme is currently in place and will run until 2013 with a budget of €51 billion.References1.""The eParticipation Network of Excellence."" DEMO-net.org.

Our members share an interest in education for a more deliberative democracy and work together to share ideas; steward and distribute knowledge; develop, validate, and disseminate practices; and encourage innovation.We are a resource to individuals and institutions. We are advocates for change in higher education.""Purpose and Mission  The Democracy Imperative's mission is to strengthen public life and democracy in and through higher education. Their written guide, the Statement of Principles and Practices, was drafted by the original members and later edited in 2007. These principles guide The Democracy Imperative (TDI) as a program, and stands to this day as their method of direction for the organization. They want to help promote a deliberative democracy through education in: democracy’s foundational ideals, conflict resolution, communication, intergroup dialogue, deliberation, democratic leadership, diversity, and civic learning.TDI is an initiative of the University of New Hampshire, but operates nationally, and maintains a free membership. Members receive updates and invitations to events. Individual members have the chance to be as much a part of the organization as they see fit. They encourage members to send announcements, syllabi, and information to contribute to the website and organization.  This organization promotes a deliberative democracy and works to expand democracy beyond its governmental definition. The Democracy Imperative’s goal is to create a more just society by furthering democracy as a set of “principles and practices,” that help guide how people interact to solve problems. They seeks to enhance to enhance the understanding of a deliberative democracy were everyone is a member in the decision making process. They do this through education, encouragement of participation, public deliberation, openness of opinion, understanding, and other characteristics. TDI seeks to advance student understanding of democracy's guiding principles, particularly freedom, justice, and equity. They want all students to graduate knowing: constitutional ideals; history and political theory of American democracy; the global context for American democracy global interdependence and problem solving, economic, issues of social and political justice, equity, and access, and the responsibilities of citizens in a free society. Information on how they are able to spread their ideas and facilitate education follows is found in the ""Activities"" and ""Major Projects sections.""  “The point is that democracy is not something we have. It’s something we do.”  Statement of Principles and Practices:  http://www.unh.edu/democracy/pdf/statement_20080612.pdfHistory  The Democracy Imperative was formed by a national network of scholars, campus leaders, and civic leaders committed to enhancing democracy within education. It all began in the fall of 2006 when a group of three, then eventually seven organizers started having meetings and exchanging ideas about the problems in American public life. They formulated ideas on “fixing disengaged citizenry, public dissatisfaction with partisan politics, an increasingly polarized public in which people move into ideological camps rather than see common solutions, persistent disparities bases on social identity and class, disturbing limitations to civil liberties, and academic freedom and environmental stability on campuses.”  The original group of The Democracy Imperative created their Statement of Principles and Practices, and revised it in 2007 and 2009. They currently welcome suggestions and encourage the use of their own Statement of Principles and Practices in other group discussion forums as a standard of democracy.  Since 2007 The Democracy Imperative has grown to nearly 450 members, from all disciplines, institutions and programs around the nation. They maintain an open source website so that materials are available to the masses.Activities  Syllabi Repository  The Democracy Imperative maintains a syllabi repository. “They request syllabi or detailed descriptions that describe courses and programs in deliberative democracy, inclusive dialogue, public reasoning and deliberation, community conflict resolution, and citizen participation in public decision and policy-making.” This is so that courses and programs throughout the nation can supplement their classes and also contribute material to the website.  Catalyst Papers  TDI asks colleges and universities to consider how they support teaching and learning for democracy, the Catalyst Papers initiative is designed to help campuses break that task down into manageable parts by asking, what can be done on campus within specific academic programs and activities.  Constitution DayCurrently, their UNH intern is collecting links and resources for campuses interested in bolstering their Constitution Day activities. Let them know if your campus is doing something worth sharing.

Write a review for the Notable Publications page or check out their Bibliography and send in suggestions.Funding  The Democracy Imperative was is sponsored by a New Hampshire Foundation and the University of New Hampshire for three years. However, due to economic hardships the program is currently unfunded. The Democracy Imperative also currently works as a community and practice, and is grateful for its website and technical support from the University of New Hampshire that it is still providing. Due to this predicament, it is open to organization or foundations that are looking for a program to sponsor. Membership is still free and open to members around the nation.Major Projects  Notable Projects: 2009 National Conference, Workshops, Projects, Working Groups, and Institutional Support.  2009 National Conference Organized by both The Democracy Imperative and the Deliberative Democracy Consortium, the 2009 National Conference was instituted on the need to discuss and deliberate the challenges and changes facing democracy in America. At this conference, members noted that campuses nationally had an increased interest in politics and a trend towards deliberative methods of democracy. They strove to understand what methods were effective and popular among student bases.  Workshops  The Democracy Imperative currently offers three workshops that they can visit college campus and teach. Those are: “An Introduction to Models of Inclusive Dialogue, Public Deliberation, and Deliberative Democracy on Campuses, An Introduction to Models of Inclusive Dialogue, Public Deliberation, and Deliberative Democracy on Campuses, Democratic Teaching Methods.” The purpose of these workshops is to educate students, staff, and faculty about different deliberative methods so that they can implement them on their respective campuses.  Projects  Projects are contributions to the website by members and the The Democracy Imperative’s Board. These can come in the form of syllabi, papers, bibliography additions, and comments. The Democracy Imperative Welcomes all comments, suggestions, and contributions, and maintains open access to all information it generates and receives.  Working Groups  Working groups are comprised of members from The Democracy Imperative and are informal meeting groups of people who share a common interest or concern and wish to discuss and improve the issue. These informal groups are open to all, and members are encouraged to join already established working groups to contribute and interact with members. Some working groups have a physical location, such as a university classroom, and other working groups choose to participate entirely online. Online workshops are done in private forums, Wiki spaces, and other forms of online interaction.  Institutional Support  The Democracy Imperative recognizes the difficulty in implementing a deliberative democracy, and is there to support institutions that need help bringing deliberation to their community or campus. TDI seeks to aid in resources and provide information so that individuals searching to develop a deliberative environment can attain the education and assistance they need to do so.Secondary Literature  Journal of Public Deliberation  http://services.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1139&amp;context=jpdLeading in the UNH community: Achieving common goals through shared leadership  http://www.unh.edu/democracy/pdf/catalyst-paper2_20071116.pdfShared Governance Literature  http://www.csus.edu/ccp/publications/Shared_Governance_in_Higher_Education_-_April_2008.pdfJournal of College and Character  http://journals.naspa.org/jcc/  U.K. Government Report on People Power  http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/communitiesincontrolVenues For Democratic Leadership and Decision Making  http://www.unh.edu/democracy/pdf/venues_democratic-governance.pdfVenues for Teaching and Learning Deliberative Democracy  http://www.unh.edu/democracy/pdf/venues_teaching-learning.pdfLinks  AACU resources on civic learning  http://www.aacu.org/resources/civicengagement/index.cfm?utm_source=pubs&amp;utm_medium=blast&amp;utm_campaign=ccresppubThe Deliberative Democracy Consortium (DDC)  http://www.deliberative-democracy.net/Everyday Democracy (Previously the Study Circles Resource Center)  http://www.everyday-democracy.orgAmerican Associations of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU) American Democracy Project  http://www.aascu.org/programs/adp .

This organization uses  Deliberative Polling®  to research about democracy and public opinion. The Center for Deliberative Democracy strives to make the general public more aware of public issues in order to make their decisions more deliberative.[1]  Origins and Development  The Center for Deliberative Democracy was established at Stanford University in 2003, where it currently conducts the research and practice of Deliberative Polling®. Previously, the center was under the name Center for Deliberative Polling and was located at the University of Texas at Austin, where Professor James Fishkin, the current director of the Center for Deliberative Democracy at Stanford, served as director.  James Fishkin developed the concept of Deliberative Polling in 1988 in response to the somewhat surprising effects of mass media on public opinion and knowledge. Early communications scholars, such as Marshall McLuhan, envisioned a world where advances in communicatory technologies such as print and radio would create a “global village,” where the public would be connected and informed on public policies and issues from all sides, including those that are least favorable to the individual, so that one may make a truly informed decision. Instead, mass media has caused the public to seek out media which represents views with which they agree and to be more focused on the entertainment value of media, dwindling campaigns to merely slogans and attack ads. Deliberative Polling was Fishkin’s institutional answer to how to make the public more informed through scientifically sampling citizens, three to four days of  deliberation  on public policies, and proper polling methods to have an end result of a more accurate public opinion. Essentially, deliberative polling is meant to show how the public would feel about public policies and issues if they were better informed and were able to discuss the issues on both the pro and con side of the argument.[2]  Professor James Fishkin has been working on his concept of Deliberative Polling for over twenty years throughout the U.S and various countries in the world, with the Center for Deliberative Democracy as the center for the research and practice of this method. The center has conducted over 50 such polls on every major continent.[3]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The Center for Deliberative Democracy is housed in the Department of Communication at Stanford University.[4] The CDD has received funding for an assortment of research and projects through various contributors. These include Stanford University, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation,[5] as well as individual donations,[6] and usage fees on Deliberative Polling, which is a registered trademark of James S. Fishkin.[7] The W. K. Kellogg Foundation awarded the Center $302,123 in 2006 and grant money from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation has been used for the Michigan-based project entitled “Hard Times, Hard Choices,” the Deliberative Polling®: By the People project.[8]  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Citizens of the United States are often uninformed about important public issues. Conventional polls represent the public’s initial impressions of headlines and audio clips.  Deliberative Polling®  was developed by the founder of the CDD, James Fishkin, in an attempt to use both television and public opinion research in a new and productive way. The polling process reveals the conclusions the public would reach, if people were more informed and more involved by the public issues.[9]  Major Projects and Events  Since its first Deliberative Poll in 1994, the Center for Deliberative Democracy has led or supported over 50 such polls on every major continent. Participating countries have included the United States, the UK, China, and, most recently, Macedonia.[10] The CDD’s Deliberative Polling events include:Deliberative Polling in the Bududa and Butalejja Districts of UgandaThe UK Deliberative Poll on CrimeTamale Deliberative Poll in Ghana‘What’s Next California?’ Deliberative PollUnited States National Issues Convention Deliberative PollDeliberative Poll on Korean ReunificationDeliberative Polling on Vermont’s Energy FutureDeliberative Polling in Marousi, GreeceThe San Mateo Deliberative PollA Deliberative Poll on Education Policy in Northern IrelandWenling City Deliberative PollDeliberative Pol on Japan’s Energy and Environmental Policy OptionsAnalysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

In addition, it fosters the participation of people around the continent in order to support and benefit the citizens of the African Union, promote incorporation of key African Union policy standards into national law by state and non-state figures, and lastly to encourage policies and programs that entail good social, political, economic, and cultural practices. The process of the CCP-AU encourages joint collaboration, research, discussion, and deliberation among participants and others in the African Union, therefore contributing to all the above key purposes. The CCP-AU believes in the inclusion of all African voices, and a citizenship that is underpinned with transparency and accountability. The CCP-AU believes that a successful country is one strengthened by the participation of its citizens, ultimately achieving collaborative development of the country.  The following is a list of the key objectives for the CCP-AU:To enhance African Civil Society Organizations’ (CSOs) awareness and knowledge of the African Union’s objectives and working procedures and provide up-to-date information of its activities  To serve as a link between African CSOs and the AU in enabling CSOs to access the Citizens and Diaspora Directorate (CIDO) and the Economic Social and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC), the official organ for CSO participation in the African Union;  To organize, conduct and coordinate Continental CSO Conferences in the lead up to the AU’s bi-annual summits with the view to enhance meaningful participation of African CSOs and generate a communiqué to enable CSOs to lobby Heads of States on AU Summit agenda issues;  To lobby and advocate the African Union member states to adopt agreements, protocols and other similar legal instruments that promote political, economical, social and cultural progress of African countries;  To advocate for the domestication of such adopted instruments into State parties’ legal system and policy framework according to local legislations;  To raise, mobilize and disburse funds and other resources to enable African CSOs to participate in Continental CSO Conferences organized by the Centre.History  The CCP-AU began in 2007, originally with the intention of facilitating and creating the participation of CSOs and encouraging a clear understanding amongst citizens of the African Union, including its key functions and decision making processes. The CCP-AU has two office locations, one in Nairobi and another in Addis, however they are aspiring to have four locations very soon. The two current offices work with the African Union Commission, the AU Judicial Organs, and the NEPAD/APRM; its three main focal organizations. The CCP-AU began in order to allow discussion and deliberation amongst citizens and CSOs about five main themes prevalent to current concerns within the continent. The five themes are listed below:  • African Union Government and Regional Integration • Democracy, Governance, Human Rights and Leadership • Economic Justice • Gender Equality and Women’s Rights • Peace and Security  Membership and participation in the CCP-AU is open to any organization or interested citizen. Members are encouraged to partake in the CCP-AU in accordance with “the spirit and letter of the Constitutive Act of the African Union and African Court of Human and Peoples’ Rights.” All organizations seeking to participate should be prepared to enhance and complement the values of the main themes listed previously. In addition, the CCP-AU website ( www.ccpau.org ) is open to the public for registration. Being a registered member of the website keeps participants and interested citizens updated with news, progress, and developments occurring within the CCP-AU. Furthermore, there is a discussion forum on the website that allows everyone to participate and converse about current affairs, CCP-AU activities/projects, CCP-AU improvements, suggestions, and questions, as well as other general information regarding CSOs in Africa.  Activities  The CCP-AU achieves it’s key objectives through a number of strategies, including training workshops on the structures and functions of the African Union, collaboration with civil society organizations (CSOs) to brainstorm new policies, supplying CSOs and other stakeholders with detailed and timely updates on the activities of the African Union through its website and listserv, as well as holding biannual Citizens’ Continental Conferences. The latter allows delegates from all around the continent the ability to deliberate on issues of common concern, and subsequently relay concrete recommendations to the Heads of State and Government meetings.  The CCP-AU’s time and energy is committed to increasing civic participation and transparency within the AU. CCP-AU members attend and participate in annual or bi-annual nongovernmental and governmental meetings concerning policy to help improve the overall enhancement of democracy. In the major projects section below, it is evident that the CCP-AU contributes to the discussion and implementation of advocacy programs. Also, as discussed earlier, the CCP-AU is committed to promoting knowledge among the social, cultural, political and economic concerns in the AU and possible policy solutions. In doing so, the CCP-AU motivates its current and incoming members to attend state or regional events. The CCP-AU in turn provides logistical support to keep its members interested and continuously active in civic engagement.  Since 2007 the CCP-AU has held training workshops for more than 100 representatives of African Citizens and CSO’s to focus on and study the structures of the AU and how to become engaged with it. In addition, the CCP-AU has organized five continental conferences, bringing together over 350 CSO representatives. These continental conferences resulted in the bi-annual summit results, which provided recommendations that were distributed to governmental delegates attending the conferences as well as the media.  Major Projects and Events  The information below is relayed on the CCP-AU website for further inquiry. Significantly, this literature is not only accessible to viewers but also to those who subscribe via their list serve database. Some of the recent major projects include:  Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the CCP-AU: This past years annual meeting was held at the Nairobi Safari Club in Nairobi, Kenya on 26th to 28th November 2010 from 8:00am – 5:00pm on each day, to consider and, if deemed fit, to pass, with or without modification, the following agenda items: 1.

Peace Day aims to put practice in peace as the continent comes together to communicate different strategies and methods. This day is in effect to impact citizens from all backgrounds, from political actors, businesses, and civil society to address the direct causes of conflict. Other planned activities for Peace Day include: -One minute of silence for peace across Africa at a pre‐agreed time;  -Relevant developmental work and community support by members of the armed and security forces in Africa, such as building bridges, repairing schools and community facilities, and providing humanitarian assistance;  -One Day One Goal football games, these are football games to be played across Africa to bring communities together around one common goal – peace -Make Peace Happen Lesson Plan: utilisation of a special lesson plan by schools and colleges in Africa on peace and Africa’s aspiration to be free from want and fear.  CSO’s Consultation on the Year of Peace and Security in Africa On January 20th and 21st of 2010, the undersigned Civil Society Organizations in Africa, including the CCPAU, and the Diaspora working in all five geographical regions of the continent met at this consultation to consider peace and security issues that the African leaders will further deliberate in the upcoming 14th Ordinary African Union Summit of Heads and State and Government. This meetings is an opportunity for participants to communicate concrete recommendations to the Heads of State and Government. The theme of the future Summit is titled, “Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in Africa: Challenges and Prospects for Development.” The CSO meeting has made suggestions in light of this theme and consideration to the year of 2010 declared to be “Year of Peace and Security on the Continent.” The consultation’s recommendations and suggestions are further found on the CCPAU’s website. Hand Guide: “Strengthening Popular Participation in the African Union: A Guide to AU Strucures and Processes” In preparation for the 14th Ordinary Summit of the African Union, Oxfam International and its partner have launched a Hand Guide on the African Union’s structures and processes. This hand guide, written in both English and French, is a helpful tool for citizens and organizations to participate with African Union policies and programs. The book is titled “Strengthening Popular Participation in the African Union: A Guide to AU Structures and Processes,” describes the governments decision-making process and the roles of the AU institutions. To view this hand guide, visit the Archives Page of the CCPAU website or follow the link below.  Funding  The CCP-AU is a self-funded organization. The CCP-AU mobilizes and disburses funds and other resources to enable African CSOs to participate in Continental CSO Conferences organized by the Centre.  Publications  The main publications from the CCP-AU are the most recent reports from the Citizens’ Continental Conferences for the African Union as well a report of the Continental Civil Society Conference on the Proposed African Union Government. These publications can be found on the website,  www.ccpau.org . They are open for any public viewer to see, and in thorough detail report the progress and results of each conference. -Report of the Fifth Citizens’ Continental conference, June 2009 (English or French) -Fifth Citizens’ Continental Conference on the AU Summit (English or French) -Report of the Fourth Citizens’ Continental Conference, January 2009 -Report of the Continental Civil Society Conference on the Purposed African Union Government -Fourth Citizens’ Continental Conference on the AU Summit  Evaluation and Critique  The CCP-AU is an organization that promotes deliberation in a participatory government setting. The organization allows citizens of the AU to gather and deliberate about issues that need attention or policy amendment. In addition, the CCP-AU attempts to inform and educate the citizens of the continent through their organization techniques and strategies such as sending updates to registered members of the organization, informing the public of decisions being made on key current issues or national affairs. Most importantly, the five main themes prevalent to concerns within the continent are focused on by the CCP-AU, therefore keeping the continents entire well being in consideration. Since the CCP-AU is one of the few organizations supporting citizen participation, its creation has been a crucial stepping-stone for the AU. The CCP-AU has proven to be a highly deliberative organization through its strategies, activities, and major events.  In terms of the analytic processes of deliberation, the CCP-AU has several strong points. Primarily, the CCP-AU has demonstrated to be very thorough at prioritizing key vales at stake. Through its training workshops, conferences, and overall function, the organization is incredibly skilled and equipped in identifying the key public concerns behind the surface facts and events that define an issue. Moreover, the CCP-AU gathers a group of people with a variety of perspectives to carefully examine and deliberate over the most important issues in the African Union, eventually to arrive well reasoned suggestions for improvements. For example, in the conference the CCP-AU organizes bi-annually, equal amounts of people are invited from each of the five regions of the continent in order to ensure diverse viewpoints. In this way the broadest possible range of solutions for solutions to problems are addressed by a large group that may have varying viewpoints.  The CCP-AU also effectively addresses several aspects of the social process for deliberation. For example, the organizations web site makes news and information understandable for readers since each event or publication the CCP-AU is involved with has an external link to more news resources. Also, with the use of diverse sources in their activities and major events (including diverse participants from all different parts of the continent with different backgrounds and perspectives), the CCP-AU reaches beyond conventional debates and discussion. There is therefore time for everyone to seek out other view points and voices in order to arrive at their own personal best decision.  However, there are still a few unclear elements in the CCP-AU. Primarily, the annual budget and how the CCP-AU raises its funding is undisclosed. It is also vague as to how many members are apart of the organization, and their demographic location. Lastly, if the web site was more properly configured with transparent information, then it would be more deliberatively effective.References  Secondary Literature  Chitiga, Rudo, Bronwen Manby, and Irungu Houghton.

Independent from the Seattle School District itself, the Alliance works directly with the community and other organizations acting as a junction between the general public and the school district. The mission of the Alliance is to serve as a catalyst for wanted change in the education system based on “a strong belief in the value of public education, the opportunity it brings to every child, and the importance of public education to the health of our whole community.” The organization works behind a self-fulfilling-prophecy idea that raising the bar in education will incite fulfillment of these expectations and benefit all students while further reducing the achievement gap. Five core values guide their process: Accountability to established goals and funders, collaboration with partners, equity for all students’ education, innovation in ideas, and transparency about the outcomes of programs, good or bad. Through its Community Engagement Task Force, the organization provides a space for the local public to express cares and concerns regarding the education system using a community engagement deliberative process.History  The Alliance for Education was created in 1995 as a result of robust unhappiness with the Seattle Public School District’s recurring trend of academic decline. The Seattle Public School District is the largest district in Washington state, educating 45,000 students on an annual budget around half a million dollars (sps.org). However, much of this budget is delegated to every-day maintenance before the school year even begins, leaving the district at a financial loss for any additional improvements or changes made. Combining three education-related organizations into one, the Alliance for Education became “a catalyst for change, a convener of community leadership, and a conduit for directing private resources ⎯ both dollars and expertise ⎯ toward critical needs in Seattle Public Schools”  Alliance for Education  Beginning with Chief Executive Officer Robin Pasquarella, the organization started off with strong community support and the excited cooperation of Superintendent John Stanford. In 2007, Pasquarella retired and was replaced by Patrick D’Amelio, the former CEO of Big Brothers Big Sisters of Puget Sound. In 2008, Maria Goodloe-Johnson was elected Superintendent of Seattle Public Schools and began the implementation of a five-year strategic plan for better learning. Around this time the organization suffered from a substantial decrease in funding and rumors of bankruptcy were on the horizon. Nonetheless, two new task forces were created in attempts to refocus the Alliance on accountability and collaboration in conjunction with the school district’s five-year plan. These new subdivisions are the Community Engagement Force and Educational Investments Task Force. Since it’s foundation, the Alliance for Education has directed over $115 million into Seattle Public Schools. Furthermore, the organization has provided leadership training for numerous teachers, School Board members, and administrators while also advocating for the social worth of retaining and rewarding high-quality teachers. Despite financial turmoil in the past three years, the Alliance for Education has remained afloat, continuing to garner the support of the Seattle community and easing the achievement gap to the best of its ability. Current President and CEO, Sara Morris, was appointed in March 2010.  Alliance Rights its ShipActivitiesActivitiesMarch 2008, Update the CommunityCollege Readiness  One in five Seattle Public School graduates currently meet the requirements to attend a four-year college.  Seattle Public Schools  The Alliance for Education is dedicated to raising the standards of a high school diploma to equate the preparedness necessary for college, the workforce, and life. This challenge requires significant focus on curriculum, course-offerings, and teacher/student support. The organization is working closely with the school district to create a consistent approach to reading, writing, math, science, social studies, and world languages to “ensure that all students have access to the highest quality content and materials.” It is also taking a direct approach to install more college-preparatory classes into high school by offering more Advanced Placement courses and International Baccalaureate programs as well as distributing the PSAT exam to all 9th, 10th, and 11th, graders to instill a college-bound mentality. In order for any success, the Alliance recognizes the need for increased teacher and student support and is helping the district train more teachers for AP curriculums as well as methods of student support.Data, Assessment, and Performance Management  Standardized testing like the WASL is useful for monitoring a school’s progress over time but the new data-assessment model, Monitoring Academic Process (MAP), is working to be instilled as a real-time measurer of student performance. MAP assessments are presented three times a school year to in attempts to quickly detect students and school that may be falling behind. Quick detection leads to quick action and better chances of success. The Seattle School District is working to create a new data system for to make such information readily attainable to teaching staff that can then make any necessary altercations to the curriculum in response. This new system will also carry over to the central office as well, allowing the public to track progress at both the school and district levelSchool Board Development  School board members are the major decision-makers in a public school system but, as elected officials, they often meet a lot of gridlock when it comes to agreeing on priorities. Board members represent various constituencies, making their communication all the more important. As part of the Alliance’s Excellence for All program, grant funding will be provided for the development of school board leaders’ governance, roles and responsibilities, policy, and other necessary areas. Public awareness of the School Board’s work will be discussed and presented in regular meetings with local and national facilitators.Staff Development  In the near future, an overhaul of the Seattle Schools District’s human resources team will attempt to gain a wider selection of quality teachers by attracting strong candidates and rewarding the excellence that already exists. As another part of Excellence for All, grant funding will provide the necessary education and training for new principals and district leaders.Major Projects and EventsCommunity Engagement  The Alliance for Education is dedicated to bridging the gap between the community and the Seattle School District. They believe that it is only with full public support and involvement that the challenges facing Seattle schools will be overcome. The Community Engagement Task Force was created as part of the organization’s refocusing plan in 2007. Here, representatives from various communities and organizations meet to discuss issues at hand and create dialogue among the public about possible solutions and ways to get involved. The task force uses the  Community Dialogue  method of deliberation to achieve a well-rounded and organized discussion between schools and the community. This effort is widely supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  “Through our community engagement efforts, we bridge the work of Seattle Public Schools and the communities it serves through constructive dialogue. By engaging the greater community in a thoughtful process, we create opportunities to inspire, inform, listen to, and learn from the collective wisdom of Seattle residents.""  [1]Community Schools  The Alliance for Educations is involved in research and discussion surrounding a successful new model of public school involvement called Community Schools (CS). CS programs engage participants in a variety of supports to children, youth, parents, and families. Common partners include healthcare, social services, educators, businesses, parents and volunteers, and local organizations. Through this approach, “the school becomes a center for student, family and neighborhood engagement, a place where school-community connections are built and reinforced” (alliance4ed.com). Common programs offered include ESL classes, counseling, refugee assistance, tutoring, and pre-school or early learning.Excellence for All  Excellence for All is an umbrella program encompassing numerous areas of the Seattle School District. The plan that focuses on improving student achievement by “providing students and teachers with the resources they need to succeed, expanding college-ready coursework for students, improving access to student data, and strengthening professional development opportunities for teachers, school leaders, and district officials” (alliance.org). The plan is funded by $9 million grants awarded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation, The Boeing Company, and The Stuart Foundation. Excellence for All is meant to support the Seattle School District’s five-year strategic plan for better learning.  Seattle School's Strategic PlanAnalysis of Project Deliberation  The Alliance for Education is based on the foundations of successful deliberation. That is, its purpose is to unite the community and school district through dialogue in hopes of creating change. Though every organization must utilize deliberation in order to function, the most active part of the Alliance for Education rests in its Community Engagement force. This portion of the organization is relatively new and still has a lot of progress to make. However, in terms of the definition of deliberation, this task force provides the space necessary to meet such social and analytical needs. That alone is a major step for improving the district-school-community relationship. [Gastil, John]Funding  The Alliance for Education relies on private donations from individuals, businesses, and foundations as well as its vast volunteer base. As of 2007, the majority of donations came from individuals closely followed by donations from Boeing and Washington Mutual (J.P. Morgan Chase), as well as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. They also host an annual breakfast and auction. The majority of funds go into data infrastructure, direct school support, and curriculum development with about twenty percent invested in leadership and community building, management, and fundraising.Philanthropic Partnership for Public Education (PPPE)  This is a group of local funders who support Seattle Public Schools. Members convene four times a year to discuss relevant initiatives and sometimes to join together on a specific project. The group focused on the purposes and usefulness of philanthropies in public schools and Washington State education as a whole. In 2009 the PPPE was responsible for funding audits that helped develop the Excellence for All program.Educational Investments  The Alliance’s Educational Investments Task Force works hand in hand, first and foremost with the Seattle Public School District, as well as the City of Seattle and higher education. The board works to distribute funds and implement actions into schools in the most beneficial way possible. Before anything is begun, board members conduct pre-investment planning to ensure that everything aligns with the overarching goals of the school district, the funders, and the organization itself. This also consists of prioritizing and pinpointing specific investments that will be most successful and will also fulfill the highest concerns of the public. Furthermore, the Task Force creates a strategic plan for sustainability of the investment as well as specific measurements of its success, which it continues to monitor over time.Further readingGastil, John.

321,organization,Development Network of Indigenous Voluntary Associations (DENIVA),https://participedia.net/organization/321,Description not available.,0,2010-12-07,2022-07-17,266,Cmadrid,https://participedia.net/user/266,421204,"""Nina Sartor""",https://participedia.net/user/421204,en,,,,Kampala,,Uganda,0.327716,32.567518,,,,,community, collaborative,,,,,,,,governance, health, education,," DENIVA (Development Network of Indigenous Voluntary Associations) is a Ugandan Network of Non-Governmental and Community Based Organizations (NGOs/CBOs) providing a platform for collective action and a voice to voluntary local associations to strongly advocate for creation of more opportunities for people and Civil Society Organizations participation in the development of Uganda. The overall objective of DENIVA is to influence poverty reduction policies and related decision-making processes in favor of marginalized groups like women, children, internally displaced persons, HIV/AIDS positive population and persons with disabilities.  Purpose and Mission  DENIVA’s purpose is to provide assistance to organizations in forming a civil society that promotes openness, tolerance and responsiveness as basis of a sustainable development in Uganda. According to their website, DENIVA’s mission is “to be a network of indigenous voluntary associations influencing poverty reduction and good governance processes and strategies through mobilizing diverse experiences, knowledge and skills of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) in Uganda onto a common platform of action”. DENIVA is committed to influence poverty reduction and minority protection policies. Ultimately, DENIVA aims to help build a Ugandan society in there exists equal citizen participation in the national level, decentralizing power from the current semi-authoritarian government. DENIVA’s purpose is to empower member civil society organizations and other groups to achieve democratic growth and sustainable development through networking, advocacy, and capacity building.  History  DENIVA was founded by representatives of 21 Ugandan NGOs in 1988. Historically, Uganda has suffered in the hands of authoritarian and oppressive governments. Citizen participation and democratic processes have been essentially foreign to Uganda – multiparty elections were not introduced until circa 2003. The network was created in an environment where there was civil discontent with centralized government and a call for decentralization of power was taking place. Scholars have classified Ugandan government as a “semi-authoritarian regime” because within its seemingly free and democratic society underlies a tight control of power – DENIVA can be seen as a large-scale response to governmental activity. Since 1986, organizations oriented in decentralization of power have been gaining space in Uganda – an advance towards a more deliberative society that sees its political power centralized in President Yoweri Museveni for over 24 years.  DENIVA has been fundamental in protecting non-governmental organizations in Uganda from authoritarian practices: NGOs in Uganda are bound by governmental registration processes that interfere with operational autonomy as ministries have easy access to monitor non-governmental activities, and dissolution procedures. Ambiguous rules such as “organizations shall not engage in any act which is prejudicial to the interests of Uganda and the dignity of the people of Uganda” and “organizations are prevented from engaging in any act which is ‘prejudicial to the security of Uganda or any part of it’” are part of the official text of the NGO Regulation Statute and DENIVA’s establishment served an important role in achieving fairness for Ugandan organizations.  Activities  As its name suggests, networking is the main activity undertaken by DENIVA: the network aims to assist members to digest and utilize positively the body of resources provided. DENIVA’s resources are set to improve access to information on development and poverty; improve development information research; generate strong resource centers online and through Uganda; identify and campaign for global advocacy issues in a pro-people manner; and foster dialogue with development stakeholders. DENIVA’s spectrum of activities can be broken down, specifically, into the following three areas:  Networking and Information Sharing: DENIVA, through information seminars and regional resource centers, serves as a facilitator, aiding member organizations in identifying and supplying for their own information needs. Communication with donors and members occur in a variety of ways, including email, telephone, national radio, and via the postal office (for members located in remote areas). DENIVA also tries to connect interested parties to help influence policy makers by providing a network ground for activists and analysts.  Self-understanding and capacity building: – DENIVA produces guidelines for NGOs and CSOs in addition to monitoring and conducting research to assist member organizations in developing independence and values in social organization and networking to achieve higher capabilities of collective action and participation in a democratic society. DENIVA’s website contains assorted information on non-governmental organizations to provide knowledge and content for independent groups to develop their own structures. DENIVA authored literature on management of resource centers and also offers training in computer basics and information management. DENIVA offers means to connect organizations so they can build their capacities independently – through the network, organizations can “trade” staff members so they can learn new skills and methods locally. DENIVA is especially concerned in training member organizations in operating within boundaries of gender sensitivity.  Policy Research and Advocacy (PRAP): DENIVA provides a unified venue for deliberation in development issues, targeting coherence, sophistication, intensity, and consistency improvements in the advocacy work of member organizations. Research found on DENIVA’s website offers studies of the relationship of non-governmental organizations and politics, corruption, health, poverty, and information, solidifying knowledge into one easily accessible database which ultimately benefits member organizations to develop thorough comprehension of the diversity of information available.  Funding  DENIVA attains funding via donations and membership subscriptions. Some of the key donating organizations include the Ford Foundation, OXFAM, NOVIB, Action Aid International (Uganda), the International Institute for Environment Development (IIED UK), DANIDA (associated donors of the organization), MS Uganda, Logo Link, Aga Khan, CUTS- London, CUTS- India, and the Overseas Development Institute, UK. The variety of donors suggests that DENIVA’s mission appeals not only to Ugandan society but also major international entities.  Major Projects  DENIVA, as a long range networking organization, has many projects working with poverty amongst the rural portions of Uganda. One of the largest efforts of DENIVA lies in coordinating other member organizations and supplying them with necessary information with the objective of building a stronger environment for their collective action and individual NGO pursuits. It can be said that DENIVA’s major project is to aid Uganda into achieving a higher quality of life and a stronger democratic society in the country. DENIVA has a strong commitment to projects regarding decentralization of power: research, workshops and studies in self-governance have been sponsored and organized by DENIVA in attempts to reinforce autonomy for non-governmental organizations of Uganda. DENIVA is also strongly devoted to enhance citizen participation and the empowerment of civil societies.  From 2006 to 2008, DENIVA ran the Poverty Eradication &amp; Livelihoods Improvement Programme(PELIP). The self explanatory goals aimed by the project were radical and aimed at helping the most marginalized portion of the Ugandan population. DENIVA admits to the eerie outcome of PELIP: their website state that “despite the reportedly improved access in social services, such as primary education, primary health care, progress in households’ incomes etc, DENIVA notes that the quality of these services is not yet showing substantial improvement in households’ welfare. Unfortunately, the poor have not benefited equally with the rest of the population.”  Uganda’s historical background also suggests major involvement of DENIVA with assurance of NGO autonomy in the country. Organizations are required by Ugandan law to register and abide by rules of the 1989 NGO Registration Statute (and subsequent amendments); Scholar Aili Mari Tripp points out that “Several hundred NGOs under the auspices of the Development Network of Indigenous Voluntary Associations met in 2001 to resist this focus on security and reject key elements of the bill as threatening NGO autonomy and undermining the constitutional provision of freedom of association.”  Evaluation and Critique  Basing off the analytic process of deliberation, DENIVA is at a respectable position: the website has produced a solid information base comprised of resources, case studies and research that aids the formation enlightened opinions. DENIVA provides an infrastructure that supplies for the articulation of Ugandan society shared and distinct views and values, especially ensuring an understanding of rural minorities. DENIVA’s research offers a broad range of views on issues related to non-governmental organizations, with regards of the positive and negative aspects of issues studies. DENIVA’s approach to decision making itself is well informed: considering the range of research done by DENIVA, the organization is able to make key decisions and act as an influential stakeholder in issues of power decentralization, policy making, and citizen participation, having established itself over the years as a well reputed NGO in Uganda.  The social aspect of deliberation is ensured with DENIVA commitments to local CSO and NGO equal participation – tribal organizations have as much of an opportunity to be heard as do the main board of the network. Education is a key aspect of DENIVA: through its workshops and research, the network aims at ensuring comprehension of key aspects of the network that affect all of its participants (utilizing the website, computer workshops, and understanding case studies). Respect is strongly encouraged by DENIVA as there is special attention to the most fragile social groups of Uganda need to equal participation and representation. The very aspect of national networking ensures the consideration of ideas and experiences from all portions of Ugandan society – an organization interested in decentralizing power and bringing equal opportunity to its citizens would not be expected to do otherwise.

The organization did so by hosting popular events and conferences throughout Canada. Those working and volunteering at C2D2 valued participatory government through D&amp;D as important to the success of a community or nation. By continually striving for these positive changes, C2D2 was able to recruit hundreds of supporters nationwide.  Origins and Development  Co-founders Miriam Wyman and Sandra Zagon attended the 2002 National Conference on Dialogue and Deliberation ( NCDD ), there realizing the beneficial need for such organizations and conferences in Canada. Three years later, in October 2005, employees at C2D2 helped host the first Canadian Conference on Dialogue and Deliberation. Wyman and Zagon's vision had come true; more than 300 people deliberately participated. The conference was deemed successful because it laid a thriving foundation for which the C2D2 was founded upon. Although the organization was officially founded in 2006, C2D2 had already created a positive impact on the nation.  Throughout its active years, the organization was responsible for a nationwide conference every other year in Canada. In between conferences, employees and volunteers strove to promote strong deliberative processes throughout Canadian communities.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The primary method the organization used was  deliberation . Every two years, the Canadian Community for Dialogue and Deliberation invited citizens and professionals to a deliberative conference.Ottawa 2005: The theme surrounding this conference was, ""From Dream to Reality"". Sandra Zagon and Miriam Wyman initially imagined such a conference in 2002. [2]  Vancouver 2007: The overall theme for Vancouver's conference was, ""Facing Complex Issues Together"". The purpose of the conference was to display all dialogue and deliberative efforts shown through multiple Canadian communities. [3]  Toronto 2009: The theme for Toronto's conference was, ""Leading Change: How Conversations Make Stronger Communities and Healthier Democracies"". This conference emulated topics discussed at the  Australia's Citizens Parliament  (February 2009). [4]Major Projects and EventsD&amp;D Evaluation ProjectThroughout the year 2010, C2D2 held multiple conference calls. This was an opportunity for citizens to evaluate the organization's efforts on strengthening dialogue and deliberation. In August and November, national conference calls were held, as well as opportunities for feedback during the Toronto conference. The organization made pdf files of the notes during each call available on their website. These calls presented valuable learning opportunities for C2D2 because of the concentrated interaction between citizens and professionals.EventsIn 2010, C2D2 helped coordinate multiple events throughout Canada, including:January 21, 2010,  Canadian and US Experiences in Public Involvement -  Learning from our Neighbors : Citizens from Canada and the northern United States shared experiences and methods on how to engage the public in environmental issues.

Here is a direct excerpt: “We believe passionately in the power of ideas to change attitudes, lives and ultimately, the world. So we’re building here a clearinghouse that offers free knowledge and inspiration from the world’s most inspired thinkers, and also a community of curious souls to engage with ideas and each other.” [5]In January 2009, videos of talks available on TED.com had been viewed 50 million times; by July 2010, that value has ballooned to 290 million views. [2]  As the organization has grown, a new breed of events under the name TEDx aim to localize and increase the reach of TED, with 1000 independent events in over 60 countries in 2010. [3]  Notable presenters in past TED events include Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Gordon Brown, Bill Gates, and various other university professors and Nobel Prize winners. [4]History  TED was formed in 1984 as a one-time conference by Richard Saul Wurman, which later became an annual event starting in 1990. Later in 2002, the TED conference was purchased by Chris Anderson for the Sapling Foundation. Only in recent years, as the growth of online media, has TED become the organization we know of today. Starting in 2007, lectures done at TED and TEDx events (otherwise known as “talks”) have been hosted on YouTube and available on iTunes.  To truly appeal to the global community nature of TED, volunteer members of TED have participated in the Open Translation Project to translate the talks into 80 languages, free of charge. Building upon the “radical openness” ethos, TED content is licensed for free to anyone wanted access to TED content.  Organizational Structure and Funding  According to TED, “TED is owned by The Sapling Foundation, a private nonprofit foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization under US tax code. It was established in 1996 by Chris Anderson, who was at that time a magazine publishing entrepreneur.”  The main TED event is sponsored by many corporations such as:Akamai  BlackBerry  AT&amp;T  Autodesk  Cisco  GE  IBM  IDEO  Intel  Liberty Mutual  Rolex  Santander  Steelcase  Tiffany &amp; Co. Foundation  UBC  and many othersTEDx events are responsible for finding their own sponsors for their events, many of which end up being sponsors local to where the event is located. The list of sponsors must be provided prior to an event, and the TED organization heavily regulates who can sponsor and requires transparency in donations.  For events that have less than 100 attendees, total sponsorship funding cannot exceed $5000, while events with more than 100 attendees are limited to less than $20000 per sponsor. Attendees themselves end up sponsoring the event themselves, with ticket prices for the main TED event running around the range of $5000 per person (which not only accounts for attendance, but copies of content TED provides to attendees). TEDx events also have ticket prices to attend, however prices scale to the popularity and location of the event.  However, TED makes it very clear for their own events and TEDx events that sponsors cannot originate from the weapons/ammunition, tobacco/cigarettes, and Adult-oriented product/service industries. In addition, rules clearly dictate that sponsors cannot have any “editorial control or veto power over your program” [9] . On top of that, sponsors cannot be present in anyway on the stage, further cementing the gap between sponsors and content discussed in TED events, making the talks credible and opening the doors for potentially controversial topics to be discussed.Specializations and Activities  TED as an organization is quite large, with programs that deal with various aspects involved with TED events. TED and its subsidiaries gather scholars of varied disciplines and notable personas in various conference formats to bring to light social/economic/political issues in the world and provide others with a new perspective on possible solutions. Using strictly structured events, TED aims to provide a way to connect visionaries to people that have the capacity to make things happen, to truly form a connected network of human beings that aim for the common good of all.  Various aspects of TED and TEDx events support deliberation, in the broad sense and in the details. One of the fundamental principles of deliberation is the collaboration of individuals from different perspectives and disciplines combining their intellect and experiences to form a broad and encompassing base of knowledge. At TED events, some of the brightest individuals on the planet are present, setting the potential for very high level deliberation. Some criticism has arisen over the fact that TED attendees must be invited to attend the events, many of which must go through an extensive application process to gauge potential attendee’s dedication to truly participating in the event. In addition, many view the high attendance costs (roughly $5000), as a form of elitism, limiting the accessibility of TED to everyone. However, I counter that the point of TED events are to provide a place for the very best of our society to tackle real-world problems in revolutionary ways, ultimately resulting in high-caliber ideas meeting the attention of those who have the capacity to make change happen. On top of that, much of the content from TED events are available online for the public to view, therefore allowing the viewer to view the talks and discuss it amongst their own peers.  TED events are structured to have multiple back-to-back lectures at strictly 18 minutes or less from various visionaries, which is meant to stimulate the mind of many. However, this tends to be TED’s weakness in terms of deliberation; where it doesn’t provide time for the group to consider and discuss the pros and cons to ideas/solutions presented to them while the content is still fresh in the attendee’s mind. TEDx events on the other hand allow breakout sessions between each lecture to allow for proper “digestion” of the content being presented to them. The event organizers are strictly told to allow proper time for the group to break up into smaller groups and process talks, which guarantees that events across the board follow the same standard. [11]In typical deliberative sessions, the group attempts to come to a general consensus and then that consensus is relayed to people or entities that have the power to execute. A major aspect where the TED organization succeeds is being able to make those two groups of people one and the same. With major attendees like Cameron Diaz to philanthropists like Bill Gates, the people with the capacity to make change are the audience to some of the most engaging proposals to benefit the world ever. This adds a step to the deliberative process, execution.  With a large foundation of knowledge combined with the brightest individuals on the planet, TED supports a form of global deliberation. It doesn’t tackle just national problems, but problems that are in the interests of everyone, whether they know it or not. Every idea has a relatively free chance to be presented to everyone, with the no difference between popular and controversial talks. With far ranging topics from global politics to the bleeding edge of technology, deliberation at TED facilitates the propagation of ideas and inspires many to take up an issue.Major Projects and EventsTEDxTEDx stands as a program that provides a TED experience on a more regional/local area, enabling schools, businesses, and other interest groups to host events that are independent of the main TED events to address issues more relevant to the area. [6]  Well known TEDx events include TEDxParis, TEDxYouth, and TEDxUSC.TED FellowsTED Fellows is a fellowship program that “helps world-changing innovators from around the globe become part of the TED community and, with its help, amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities. Fellows are drawn from many disciplines that reflect the diversity of TED's members: technology, entertainment, design, the sciences, the humanities, the arts, NGOs, business and more.” [7]TED PrizesStarting in 2005, TED Prizes awarded three distinguished individuals $100,000 each annually to assist them in fulfilling a wish they expressed in changing the world. In 2010, only one prize winner was chosen, in order to focus resources to increase the winner’s chance of accomplishing his/her wish. [8]Open Translation ProjectTo respond to the popularity of TED and TEDx events around the world, TED launched a program called the Open Translation Project. By combining the large human capital of the attendees and TED volunteers, the program aims to provide subtitles and time-coded transcripts for all of the TED talks available. At the time of writing, 80 languages are represented in 13357 translations by 4353 translators on various talks made at TED events. The languages with a large amount of translations include Czech, French, Hebrew, Korean, Romanian, and Spanish.

We define dialogue as “listening deeply enough to be changed by what you learn.” [1]Origins and DevelopmentFounded in 2002 by American diplomat Dr. Hal Saunders, The Sustained Dialogue Institute (SDI) began as a collaboration with Princeton University for students to dispute heavy topics.Dr. Saunders arose as a member of a small mediation group for Arab-Israeli agreements “including the Kissinger shuttle agreements, the Camp David accords and the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty.”In his observations during these meditations, Dr. Saunders learned that participants’ relationships developed over time with distinct patterns. Considering his observations, the Institute established two foundations forthe process of sustained dialogue  : “(1) focuses on transforming relationships that cause problems, create conflict, and block change; and (2) emphasizes the importance of effective change over time” [2]The process of Sustained Dialogue began developing with the collaboration with students in 2002, but the Institute was first developed as a project in 2003, founded by the Sustained Dialogue Campus Network made up of Dr. Saunders graduate students.Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingThe Sustained Dialogue Institute receives funding through donations from individuals and institutions that act as sponsors, such as: The Kettering Foundation, The W.K. Kellogg Foundation. The Carnegie Corporation of New York, The Foundation for Global Community, The Fetzer Institute. Princeton Class of 1952, MRM Worldwide, USA Network, Comcast Xfinity, The Boeing Corporation, The Whitman Institute, The Hershey Company, Bloomberg, The Lisle Foundation, The McFarlane Family Foundation, and the American Eagle Outfitters Foundation.The SDI acts as a public charity and nonprofit organization [3]Through a subscription service, SDI provides quarterly newsletters that provide updates on workshops and summits as well as access to archives.The Sustained Dialogue Institute also offers volunteer and career opportunities as well as encourages students to start a campus chapter in which they can establish a partnership with the Institute workshops or membership engagements.Specializations, Methods and ToolsSustained Dialogue is identified as finding causal relationships that hinder the process of deliberation to occur and to provide a space to produce the capacities necessary, to practice these capacities, and to create the relationships vital to political and economic democracy.The SDI also coordinates the use of Sustained Dialogue through the Sustained Dialogue Campus Network (SDCN), an organizational/networking tool developed to assist colleges with the implementation and support of SD Groups.Sustained Dialoguefocuses and analyzes the nature of individual and community relationships. This is understood through a 5 stage process: “The “Who”: Deciding to Engage, The “What”: Mapping and Naming, The “Why”: Probing Problems and Relationships, The “How”: Scenario building,and The “Now”: Individual and Collective Action” [4]How to Initiate Training on CampusPartnerships with the Institute can be done through holding a worship or membership engagementThe Sustained Dialogue Institute website provides a contact button to schedule a call and determine an offer amongst long time partnerships, workshops, virtual enrollment as well as pricingThe Sustained Dialogue Campus Network has 64 campus connections internationally and provides case studies of how programs have been institutes through program campus integrations.University of Tampa:https://sustaineddialogue.org/studies/case-study-1/Northwestern University:https://sustaineddialogue.org/studies/case-study-2/Case Western Reserve University:https://sustaineddialogue.org/studies/case-study-3/Major Projects and EventsAs The Sustained Dialogue Institute began as a collaboration between professors and university students, it continues its efforts through Sustained Dialogue programs on University campuses as well as reaching out to smaller communities, workplaces, as well as internationally.University campuses and SD academy“  Sustained Dialogue Academy teaches leadership skills to bridge divides.” [5]The Sustained Dialogue Academy provides full access to its resources and training across college campuses. It does not limit student access to just university grounds but allows students in cohorts who do not have access to a college's campus. The curriculum is based in Capitol Hill but expands its services nationally and internationally offering in-person and online training.The SD academy is actively providing spaces for individuals searching to improve their workplace and personal skills so that enrollment in academic institutions will no longer be a requirement.As campus life evolves with the academy, the Institute provides a full outline of the who, what and where of the program.

The SDI provides examples from its bases in Washington, DC, Columbus, Indiana, and Puerto Rico.Washington DC:Kindred was founded in 2016 assisting families and POC’s with obtaining equity in education, environment, and resources for children. Their partnership with the Sustained Dialogue began in 2017 encouraging parents to learn the 5 stages of SD, “culminating in an action plan to improve their school. Kindred’s dialogue groups are forming a network of diverse parents fighting for equity.” [6]Columbus, Indiana:“The Columbus Indiana Community Area Sustained Dialogue, now completing two full years of monthly sessions, focuses its work on identifying and addressing obstacles to and creating opportunities for economically challenged citizens to achieve self-sufficiency – economically, socially and emotionally.” [7]Puerto Rico:“For almost a year in 2014 a diverse group of stakeholders in the controversial education reform movement in Puerto Rico requested SDI Associate Ramon Daubon’s help in organizing and moderating a slowly broadening dialogue separate from the contentious official policy process.” [8]InternationalAs Dr. Saunder’s work originated in international mediation efforts, a global resolution has remained a priority for SD groups to organize meetings and active programs for conversations between countries.“SDI oversees the longest-running citizen’s dialogue between the United States and Russia, and has administered dialogue programs in the Middle East, countries in the former Soviet Union, and Africa. We also have campus programs in Africa and Mexico.” [9]Case studies between Sustained Dialogue and international conferences can be examined from 1960 to 2015 including:The Dartmouth Conference (1960 - 2015):a bilateral sustained dialogue between present Russia and the United states discussing preemptive and preventive measures for resolutions of nuclear war and strengthening relationships between the two great powersTajikistan (1993 - 2005):a conference made up of Russian and Americans to resolve the civil war and negotiate peace to establish democratic strategies resolved from the Dartmouth Conference.Armenia and Azerbaijan (1993 - 2007):sustained dialogue resolved over 6 years of conflict and peace negotiations to determine a ceasefire, resulting in developments in participatory peace processes to implement dialogue amongst meeting participants.Southern Africa (2003 - 2005):a relationship developed with the Sustained Dialogue Campus Network and the Institute for Democracy in Africa, to address socio-economic inequalities and the elimination of violence. Sustained Dialogue established the relationship between marketplace citizens and local governments to create accessible communication to address those conflicts.Arab-American European Dialogue (2004 - 2007):meetings made up of citizens globally addressed the armed conflict in the Arab world in response to the events of September 11, 2001. Topics addressed focus on the awareness of post-conflict realities in middle eastern countries and Muslims in Western countries.Iraq (2007-2009):Sustained Dialogue developed legislation and implementation to support reconciliation in Iraq to counteract political movements in which they succeeded in “1) recognition by nearly all parties of the urgency of ending the conflict, 2) recognition of this dialogue as providing such a possibility, and 3) participant readiness to work through their deeply-rooted ethnic, religious, and political differences. This dialogue continues today under Italian leadership.” [10]Annual EventsExternal form campus events coordinated by faculty and students partnered with the Institute, Sustained Dialogue programs have events and workshops available to the public surrounding involvement activities and education summits to learn more about the Institutes in-person and virtual programs.National Dialogue Awards:a recognition ceremony to “honor the awardees and celebrate the role of dialogue in transforming national and global conflicts” [11]SD Academy Workshop: Bridging Divides Through SD:a workshop for managers and staff members to “learn about how Sustained Dialogue, a proven conflict management strategy, can be used in your workplace and community.

Along with the five stages of Sustained Dialogue, relationships, in this case, are analyzed through five elements:Identity  : An individual’s self-identification of their own experiencesInterests:An individuals core values for want and need considering all things tangible and non-tangiblePower:the capability to have control and effect in your own life as well as othersPerceptions:assumptions developed by society that manipulate our thinking whether right or wrong contributing to the stereotypical analysisPatterns of Interaction:the interactivity between individuals and groups developed by asserted projections resulting in positive, negative, or neutral responsesPublicationsBooks by Harold H.

The purpose of CIVICUS is to help nations to improve citizen participation in community service and around shared humanitarian causes. This action is meant to connect with governments and encourage them to cultivate what they see as an under-cultivated resource, civilian engagement.  More specifically, the goal is to aid civil society-oriented, non-profit NGOs in the protection, restoration, or expansion of “civic space”, civilian freedom, and motivation to gather around and solve social problems. In a 2005 interview, CIVICUS's Secretary General, Kumi Naidoo, stated that at the time, the focus of the group was rectifying the “attack on civil liberties that is happening in the context of the war on terror.” [2] All of these goals are founded on the opinion that a democracy can only exist if it allows, and more importantly harnesses, the energy and creativity of its citizenry.  The stated values the CIVICUS views as integral to its purpose as they appear on the CIVICUS website:[3]Justice and Equality - CIVICUS believes in the equality and dignity of every person, and that all people should be free to exercise their rights as citizens as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Reciprocity - CIVICUS exists to ensure that people treat one another with the respect with which they themselves wish to be treated. Civil society cannot thrive without mutual respect.  Knowledge - CIVICUS recognises that to increase its global awareness of civil society and before it can assist or take action, it needs to form alliances with other concerned bodies to increase its influence and knowledge.  Vision - CIVICUS is realistic about conflict in today's world, but remains optimistic that most people, organisations, governments and businesses will work together for the benefit of all.  Principled Courage - CIVICUS will always promote civil justice and pledges to act in a manner that honours the principles of democratic civil society.Origins and Development  The development of CIVICUS began in 1991 with the meeting of a group of twenty civil society leaders and the agreement to form an experimental international alliance of individuals and NGOs with the aim of enhancing civil society around the globe. CIVICUS was officially formed in Barcelona in 1993 and the original board consisted of members from 18 different countries. Since then it has expanded and begun many new projects. The first  CIVICUS World Assembly  was held in 1995, and it has been held many times since. It is largely out of these conferences that the initiatives were begun: The Civil Society Index in 2000, The Affinity Group of National Associations in March 2004, The Civil Society Watch in 2005, and the Legitimacy, Transparency, and Accountability initiative began in 2010.[4]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  When CIVICUS was founded, it was temporarily based in Washington D.C., but it relocated and is permanently headquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa. Kumi Naidoo was the Secretary General of CIVICUS between mid-1998 and 2008, presiding over the majority of the organization's growth. He was replaced soon after leaving by Ingrid Srinath, and as of 2021, the Secretary General is Lysa John Berna.[5]  There are over 9,000 participants in around 175 different countries.[6] The purpose of this membership is to create an influential force by coordinating with partner NGOs and NGO leaders. These members' influence spans from the local to international levels. The nature of the various NGOs is diverse in terms of their contribution to civil society, including: “civil society networks and organizations; trade unions; faith-based networks; professional associations; NGO capacity development organizations; philanthropic foundations and other funding bodies; businesses; and social responsibility programs.”[7]Based on past CIVICUS annual reports (2008 was the most recent available year, as of writing), it receives the vast majority of its funding from public and private grants. In this report, the following organizations were credited with funding support:[8]  ActionAid International, African Monitor, Aga Khan Foundation Canada, Amnesty International, Australian Volunteers International (AVI), Canadian International Development Agency, Carnegie UK Trust, Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, Christian Aid, Commonwealth Foundation, Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, CordAid, Debt, AID, Trade Africa (DATA),  Ford Foundation , Ibis, Institute of International Education, Inter-American Foundation, International Development Research Centre/Centre de Recherches pour le Développement International (IDRC/CRDI), Inter-America Foundation, Irish Aid, International Human Rights Exchange (IHRE), University of Witwatersrand, International Senior Lawyers Project (ISLP), New Zealand Aid, Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD), One Campaign, Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie (OIF), Overseas Development Institute, Oxfam America, Oxfam GB, Oxfam Novib, Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Sasakawa Peace Foundation, Schooner Foundation, Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO), Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), Tides Foundation, Trocaire, United Nations Democracy Fund,  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) , United Nations Millennium Campaign, United Nations Volunteers (UNV), Wallace Global Fund, Wolfensohn Family Foundation, World Vision International.  CIVICUS also charges a small membership fee, and accepts donations from individuals.  When CIVICUS was founded, it received funding from the Ford Foundation, the Kellogg Foundation, the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, and the Carnegie Corporation. To countries that were expected to struggle with the costs of participation, The Hitachi Foundation gave $250,000.[9]Specializations, Methods and Tools  CIVICUS sees itself as an international platform for connecting similarly-concerned citizens to each other, as well as to information resources, and possibly being a conduit for the creation of new NGOs.In pursuit of the realization of their values (see Mission and Purpose above), CIVICUS works to expand and protect free association and collective action rights, improving civil society management, particularly in goal setting, and encouraging productive relationships between civil society organizations and other institutions.Outside of the main four campaigns under the CIVICUS umbrella, the Affinity Group of National Organizations (AGNA) and the  CIVICUS World Assembly (CWA)  are both important undertakings for the organization.  The CIVICUS World Assembly is a conference that has been held periodically since 1995. It has taken place all over the world: six different countries for nine conferences. This conference is open to participation from the general public, business, and civil society and government leaders. A few past speakers at the CWA: Former US President Jimmy Carter, Desmond Tutu, and Former Ireland President Mary Robinson. The conference picks a new theme each time; the last two theme statements were “People, Participation and Power” and “Accountability: Delivering Results.”[10]  The Affinity Group of National Associations was started in 2004 for the purpose of gathering networks of NGOs that operate on a national or regional level. The focus of AGNA is creating a resource for information on civil society as well as encouraging international coordinated civic engagement in trans-boundary causes. It works to advocate for these associations which “actively promote the values and principles that underpin CIVICUS.”[11]Major Projects and EventsThe Civil Society Index (CSI)  is a method for quantitatively measuring the quality of a nation's civic openness and participation. The idea is that it will be used to develop plans for strengthening civil society in each nation that uses it. The CSI is managed by national level NGOs to expand the base of knowledge useful for strengthening civil society. Government, supporters, and scholars all are involved with a nation's CSI process.  To achieve positive change, the CSI conductors use “participatory and other research methods to create an assessment of the state of civil society.” Once finished, the findings are used to create goals and a plan for the improved quality and sustainability of civil society in the medium to long term. Part of this improvement consists of increasing real world impact on community problems and social progress. [12]The Participatory Governance Programme (PGP)  focuses on governments and NGOs in the southern hemisphere. It works to improve the accountability and citizen involvement in governmental action at all levels. The way the PGP seeks to do this is by increasing the knowledge base regarding the effective execution of participatory government; by educating facilitators on how best to cultivate civic involvement; by strengthening connections between volunteers/NGOs and government leaders/institutions; and by providing support to new, original projects/methods supported by both government and civil society, and aimed at promoting participatory governance.  The purpose of the  Legitimacy, Transparency, and Accountability Programme (LTA)  is to develop institutional mechanisms to make civil society organizations more transparent and accountable. This is done with the belief that NGOs cannot be effective or sustainable without accountability measures. This initiative works to recognize and analyze legitimacy threats, to institute appropriate methods of ensuring accountability, and to continue to learn and develop effective mechanisms based on prior instances of LTA issues.Civil Society Watch (CSW)  is a program relating to the timely identification and response to what is evaluated to be a threat to civil society and democratic liberties, mostly from the perspective that states are reacting to terrorism and other threats by instituting policies that are unacceptably intrusive. The primary way of doing this is the Early Warning System that the program has developed. This system works by monitoring media, governmental publication/statements, IGO reports, NGO reports, and in some cases civilian observation, and then producing an assessment every two weeks on possible jeopardy to civil society. The actions following these reports may include press statements, writing letters to decision making bodies, etc.Analysis and Lessons Learned  CIVICUS is not exactly a  deliberation -dedicated body, but clearly its values and goals are oriented toward the sharing of knowledge, the freedom of ideas and association, and drawing the citizenry into participation in issues at the local to global level. These aims will both directly and indirectly provide support for good deliberation.  By promoting participation in NGO work and civic involvement, CIVICUS encourages the  education  of citizens in social and political issues. This also allows for the consideration of more and presumably more diverse viewpoints. Through its creation of various forums for international information exchange, CIVICUS broadens the knowledge base of leaders in diverse fields. These platforms allow more people to express their viewpoints. The LTA initiative augments these benefits by working to shed light on the origins of information and possible viewpoint influences, improving the knowledge base's quality.  Also, the CWA is a deliberative body. The conference attracts participants from all over the world. The CWA evaluates itself on criteria such as southern hemisphere and regional participation, and participant learning. The conference is broken into much smaller  workshops , with greater individual participation the goal.Publications  CIVICUS' publications are available on their  website .

The ICDD is has relations to many other deliberative organizations in the nation to help progress and promote Deliberative Democracy.Mission and PurposeThe purpose that drove the ICDD to be formed was because they feel like that in our society our social and political decision making is not driven by the right motives anymore. Instead it is being monopolized and polarized by party politics, people who manipulates the system and tries to control it. They feel that the voice of everyday citizens voices are being silence and our country is not staying true in being a democratic nation, because the common citizen does not get their viewpoint heard or expressed. Its mission in the own words of the ICDD, “Our mission is to build community capacity for informed, engaged, civil deliberation.” They also feel that many people in the public are not properly informed of what is going on in our social and politcal issues, therefore the, “ICDD’s purpose is to engage in research, education, and facilitation of civic communication processes that promote an informed citizenry, community-based decision making ultimately enhancing our democracy.”[  http://icdd.k-state.edu/about ]The ICDD utalizes their faculty full of experts to try to help facilitate and produce civic engagement and Delierative Demorcracy within its communnity by holding forums, public meetings and deliberations.Below are the rules and guidelines that the ICDD uses everytime they facilitate any type of these following engagements to ensure inclusive, civil dialouge.Our ground rules for public discussion are:• Seek understanding and common ground • Expect and explore conflicting viewpoints • Give everyone opportunity to speak • Listen respectfully and thoughtfully • Appreciate communication differences • Stay focused on issues • Respect time limits  [1]HistoryThe Institute for Civil Discourse and Democracy was founded at Kansas State University in 2004 in response to, “negative political discourse that permeates our society.”The ICDD promotes themselves as an interdisciplinary and non-partisan organiazation. It has partnerships with many other similar organizations in the nation. Including the following:Eisenhower Presidential Library and MuseumHeartland FoundationInteractivity FoundationKansas National GuardK-State’s Center for Engagement and Community DevelopmentKettering FoundationNAMI KansasNational Issues ForumUnited States Institute for Environmental Conflict ResolutionKids Voting KansasKansas City Star: Midwest Democracy ProjectKansas City ConsensusActivitiesThere are 5 main active role that the ICDD contributes to in its organization. They are as follows: facilitate, educate, research, train and engage.FacilitateThe ICDD understand the importance of having highly trained and professionals to help facilitate any type of deliberative discusssion, so that it can be organized well and can fully take advantage of civic engagement. That is why in the organization they have an active role in holding workshops and forums on a regular basis to help train new facilitators within the community so that there are more qualified facilitators that can be access in their community. These workshops are offered to educators, government officials, community activist and students.EducateThe ICDD is also involve in helping reshape the K-12 system and College curriculum in their state to help make the educational platform easier to engage with Deliberative Democracy. Example of this are two new courses that they create: Dialouge on Democracy and Communication and Democracy which the basis of the course helps shape the understanding of deliberative engagement.ResearchFaculty members and students that are all part of the ICDD is constantly engaging in extensive research of the latest: case, organizations, and/or methods that involves Deliberative Democracy worldwide to help ensure that they are always most up to date to any types of new methods to help better promote or exercise this ideal.TrainThe ICDD also regularly hold forums and workshops for citizens to attend that helps train them about social or political issues.EngageThe ICDD takes every opportunity to help get involve and engage with their community and other organizations like big business, non-profit sectors and educational institutions to help further educate the community in what they are trying to represent. They understand the important of civic engagement and lead by example by going out into the community to reach out to all the different types of organizations.Major ProjectsThe Institute for Civic Discourse and Democracy is involved in many different projects with many different organizations in the nation. Some of the more prominant ones are: Midwest Democracy Project with KC Star, Journal of Public Deliberation and Rural Grocery Initiative.Midwest Democracy Project with KC StarThis is a big scale project that is launched in Kansas City with the conbine efforts of The ICDD, Kansas City Star and a couple other educational institutions, in efforts to host three different public forums on three different political topics. The three topics that they are covering are:A Community Conversation on Economic Security: How Should We Take Charge of Our Future?A Community Conversation on Education: What is the 21st Century Mission of our Public Schools?A Community Conversation on Economic Security: How Should We Take Charge of Our Future?For more information you can access the following link  [2]Journal of Public DeliberationThis is a project that the ICDD partner up with Deliberative Democracy Consortium (DDC). It is an online journal of Public Deliberation that people can go online to access and two of the members of the ICDD Dave Procter and Tim Steffensmeier were chosen as the new co-editors of this online journal. For more information on the Journal of Delibration you can access this link.  [3]Rural grocery InitiativeThis was a forum that the ICDD hosted for over 50 local rural grocery store owners to join forces to deliberate on how to take action on the big grocery compnay chains that are taking over all the businesses, running all the small business owners out. At the end of the process they actually came up with an initiative to the state placed on the ballot.FundingThe Institute for Civic Discourse and Democracy is funded by donations and also support from the government due to the fact that it is an organization under the Kansas State University it can utalize funds from the school to maintain the organization.Evaluation and CritiqueThe idea behind The Institute for Civic Discourse and Democracy is a good one. It is very similar to many other state ran orginazation that tries to help promote the idea of Deliberative Democracy and helping the people in our country to learn to speak up and be informed about Political and Social issues.The one set back of this organization is that it is very localized, and mainly focuses on the state of Kansas. However it is a very good model organization that could help motivate other states that don't currently have organizations like the ICDD to use them as an example to model after. Therefore if every state has their own ICDD than it can all work together to form one National ICDD.Referenceshttp://icdd.k-state.edu/abouthttp://icdd.k-state.edu/what-we-dohttp://icdd.k-state.edu/http://www.ruralgrocery.org/http://services.bepress.com/jpd/Secondary LiteratureDavid Procter Moderated a Lecture on Judicial Diversity (David Procter 2009)The Deliberative Democracy Handbook—Strategies for Effective Civic Engagement in the Twenty First Century (John Gastil, 2005)Midterm Mud: Making a Mess of Elections (Jeffery Weiss 2010)Linkshttp://www.dwightdeisenhower.com/library-museum.htmlhttp://www.heartlandfoundation.org/http://www.interactivityfoundation.org/http://www.kansasarmynationalguard.com/http://www.kettering.org/http://www.deliberative-democracy.net",1,0,0,0,0,

The League of Women Voters is a grassroots organization composed of the people and operates on a National, State, and Local level. There are leagues represented in all fifty states, in addition to many local leagues across the globe. There are approximately 150,000 members nationwide (as of 2006). The League of Women voters operates on a national level with grassroots support from state and local leagues.  [1]Purpose and Mission  The league of women voters does not support or oppose candidates at any level of government participation. The league, however, is very political, striving to “influence policy through advocacy” and declaring their support or opposition of political issues (after examining them and reaching a consensus on a position. The league is described as the “original grassroots citizen network” and is directed by the general consensus of its members nationwide (900 state and local league). The league strives to enhance comprehension of major public policy issues through education and advocacy, along with lobbying in congress. The incumbent president of the League is Elisabeth MacNamara and Nancy E. Tate is the Executive Director.  [2]History  Carrie Chapman Catt founded the league in 1920 in Chicago in the wake of the final meeting of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. The establishment of the league was roughly six month prior to the Ninetieth amendment to the United States Constitution, which granted women the right to vote. Maud Wood Park was the first president. Initially, the organization strived to help newly enfranchised women become familiar with the voting process; such as where to register, how to assess candidate and ballot information, and what to do at the polling boxes.  [3]  Though the organization was composed of women the league did not want its activities to be confined to women’s issues. The three chief aims of the organization were to: 1. Complete enfranchisement of all women, 2. To remove all legal discrimination against women, 3.to make democracy safe so that every citizen feels secure and other nations acknowledge the United States as legitimate.  [4]  The league was divided into seven regions with regional directors and officers in addition to an overarching board of directors and a president (Maud Wood Park). In the league third year it took global initiative by inviting representatives from Latin American nations to participate in a pan American conference of women. In 1973, the league allowed males to join. Prior to this it was an all female organization. One of the first bills the league endorsed was the Sheppard-Towner Act in 1921, which provided federal aid for maternal and child care programs. This was the leagues first effective use of grassroots organization and active citizen education to organize participants into action.  [5]  In 1930, the league fought to solve a government corruption issue; hundreds of federal employees were politically supported in their government jobs. The league endorsed the merit system, which would base merit on the individual’s qualifications. This system would attempt to stop the government practice of giving federal jobs under the “Spoils System.”  [6]  The league was successful in helping to reduce this practice and in 1938 the Bill was passed which placed jobs under civil service. The league became more environmentally oriented in 1933 when they supported a legislation to develop The Tennessee River basin, the site of a publically owned power facility. The league continued their environmental pursuits by working to enact and implement the clean air act and the clean water act. The league also focused on the lack of public transportation and ways to promote conservation. In 1960 and 70s the league focused more on basic human rights, such as the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. The league focused its efforts on the 1980s Roe v. Wade Case, which granted women the constitutional right to make reproductive choices. In the 1990s the league refined their education fund by established a project to help guide civic education of women in emerging democracies. During this time the league worked to help register more Americans to vote by passing the national voter registration act. This act would help clarify the registration process and improve and reshape the position the government plays in the registration process. Currently, the league is working on health care reforms, effective gun control, and finance reforms.  [7]Current issues  The leagues issues can be categorized into four categories of activity; representative government, international relations, natural resources, and social policy.Representative government  “Promote an open governmental system that is representative, accountable and responsive.”  [8]Campaign finance  In the 2008 presidential campaign, the league urged candidates to back the reform to the Presidential Public Financing System and legislation to fix public financing systems for the president, in addition to establishing a congressional public financing for the first time.  [9]Citizen Participation  In the 109th Congress the League supported The Openness Promoted Effectiveness in our National Government Act. The act broadens the openness and accountability of the federal government by improving the Freedom of Information Act, and making information easier for people to acquire. In accordance with this, the league launched the “Openness in Government: Looking for the Sunshine,” which was a project to expand public awareness about issues concerning the accountability in the government. To effectively do this the league created educational material to distribute to citizens.  [10]Individual liberties  In 2007 and 2008, the league encouraged legislation that would protect personal information of citizens by restricting the FBI’s authority to issue national security letters in lieu of judicial warrants to find materials and related information.  [11]Public Policy on Reproductive Choice  In 2008, the league fought to stop the limitation of reproductive health care options for women by enabling the physicians and other providers to control their services based on their own perspectives of the reproductive health care. The league filled comments with the department of Health and Human Services to help their cause.  [12]Congress  In 2007 and 2008, the league pressured congress to ratify lobbying reform measures to set limits on fundraising for lobbyists and lobbying firms; alter the gift, travel, and employment relationships among congress members, and consequently establish a new enforcement mechanism.  [13]International Relations  “Promote peace in an interdependent world by working cooperatively with other nations and strengthening international organizations.”  [14]United Nations  In 2008, the league in a joint effort with other NGOs made an official statement to the UN Commission on the State of Women emphasizing that the equality of girls is a basic tenet of all human rights. Currently, the league is working with the United Nations Campaign UNITE to End Violence against Women, to raise awareness and support to stop violence against women and girls around the world.  [15]Trade  In 2002, the league opposed giving the president new negotiating authority for trade agreements. The league believed that the new authority put in jeopardy environmental, labor, and political values in trade negotiations.  [16]U.S. Relations with developing countries  In 2006, the league planned “Women in the Americans: paths to political power,” an event to bring together female political leaders through the Americas. The aim was for women to discuss important issues.  [17]Arms control  From 1997 to October 1999, the league lobbied for the sanction of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The senate rejected the resolution of the ratification. The league brought this issue back up in 2000, when it worked in opposition of the use of a planned national missile defense system and in support of the ABM Treaty.  [18]Military policy and Defense Spending  Refuted to funding for the strategic defense initiative (since 1985) and has contributed to the efforts to limit spending increases for the SDJ program.  [19]Natural Resources  “Promote an environment beneficial to life through the protection and wise management of natural resources in the public interest....agriculture policy, nuclear issues, land use, air quality, resource management, environmental protection and pollution control, water resources.” [20]Global climate change  Currently the main issue of concern for the League of Women Voters. The league encourages that federal action be taken to reduce global warming on both a global and national scale. The league believes that global warming can be reduced using current technologies to make power plans and factories more efficient, make cars suffice on less gasoline, and use cleaner technologies.  [21]Public participation  In 1996, the league worked in collaboration with the Department of Energy to develop a National Dialogue on Nuclear Materials and Waste Management. The league proposed a National Dialogue with the aid of planning groups and independent facilitators. June-November 1997, pilot field workshops were held, despite some opposition from environmentalist and state officials.  [22]Social policy  “Secure equal rights and equal opportunity for all. Promote social and economic justice and the health and safety of all Americans.....education, employment and housing, equal rights, fiscal policy, health care, immigration, meting basic human needs, child care, children at risk, violence prevention, gun control, urban policy, death penalty.”  [23]Health care reform  Currently, the league is focusing most of its efforts onto Health Care Reforms. In 2007 and 2008, the league backed reauthorization of the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. This program provided coverage of health care to six million low-income children. The league aimed to encourage Senators and Representatives to fund the program. The legislation was vetoed by President Bush, but passed by the House and Senate.  [24]Basic Human Needs  The League supported the legislation to create the National Housing Trust Fund in 2002. This legislation would establish a national housing trust fund by extra funds from the FHA (Federal Housing Administration). In result, new housing would be created for low-income families.  [25]Nondiscrimination and affirmative action  The league in collaboration with other organizations, supported the Americans With Disabilities Act Amendment Act of 2008, which restored the ADA to its original objective to protect the rights of disabled Americans in all aspects of society. The bill was signed by President Bush and passed by Congress.  [26]Funding  Local, State or National education funds contribute financially to the League. Contributions to the league are tax deductible for the donor. The leagues and its projects are funded through foundation grants (sometimes with pass-through grants for local/state Leagues). Money is also generated through membership.  [27]External Links[ www.easyvoter.org/][ www.votesmart.org/]Secondary Sources  Brumbaugh, Sara Barbara.

Programs from the station all have underlying purposes and targeted audiences, which use their uncommon formats to educate, stimulate conversation, and develop the minds of all listeners.  Bush Radio wrote its mission statement when it first began over a decade ago, yet it still is applied to each program today. It reads as follows:  “To ensure that communities who have been denied access to resources take part in producing ethical, creative and responsible radio that encourages them to communicate with each other, to take part in decisions that affect their lives, and to celebrate their own cultures. Through such radio, communities will affirm their own dignity and identity, and promote social responsibility and critical thinking”.[1]Origins and DevelopmentIn 1989, during the height of the apartheid era in South Africa, a community service project called Cassette Education Trust (CASET) began, which involved dispersing cassette tapes that brought about information to help build a dependable democracy. These tapes were the equivalence of a political talk radio program, but were not punishable by the government due to the non-broadcasted nature of the discussions. Unfortunately with CASET, community input was impossible; yet the idea for Bush Radio came from the combination of the CASET contents and nature of speech, with the ability for listeners to contribute their viewpoints on the issues.  Bush Radio formed in 1992, but did not broadcast until April 25th, 1993. Unfortunately, the station had not been granted a broadcasting license from the government, and within hours of that broadcast, the government arrested and charged the company’s major leaders and seized vital broadcasting equipment.  Protests  from the Bush Radio students and volunteers pressured the government to drop the charges against the Chairperson and Coordinator of the station and return all of the equipment. In 1994, South Africa had their first democratic elections, which brought a more integrated society upon South Africa. This also brought about the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), which was meant to supervise the radio industry in South Africa at the time; it was the IBA which first granted Bush Radio its broadcasting license, first temporarily but later reinstated permanently in 2002. Since 2002, Bush Radio has been broadcasting 24/7 with more than just musical content.Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingKnow how this organization operates internally? Help uscomplete this section!Specializations, Methods and ToolsListener ParticipationThe programs offered by Bush Radio vary in format and structure. Some programs discuss African politics and have callers contribute their opinions to the debate. For example, on Saturday afternoons, the topic changes to underage drinking and drugs as teenagers talk on air, while also asking for callers to add to the  deliberation  on these issues. On Friday evenings, Michael Parenti – a political author and lecturer – is a featured speaker in the commentary. These discussions are presented amidst the vast musical selection in a unique style that holds interests, yet provides stimulating and inviting conversations about various separate topics.Bush Radio and the CommunityBush Radio participates actively in the community, making it much more than just a radio station. It not only broadcasts, but it also engages in uplifting community projects, provides scholarships and training programs for those interested in a radio career path, as well as investing in human potential development at all ages.Bush radio is able to affiliate itself as a community radio due to its fulfillment of all three aspects of that specific category of broadcasting media, including access, participation and self-management. Bush Radio presents itself to the community in a friendly and welcoming environment through all of its activities. It encourages community involvement through callers and input on current issues and other topics. It is also uses a small staff – including trainees through the BTI partnership – and many volunteers to keep the station up and running.Major Projects and EventsSome of the most prominent Bush Radio regional projects include the Youth Against Aids (YAA) and the collaboration with the South African Red Cross Society, with each project having its own relevant on-air segment. Furthermore, Bush Radio awards scholarships to candidates that they see with the most potential to succeed, mainly in the field of journalism/broadcasting. They also partner with Broadcasting Training Institute (BTI) to provide superior training to its member, including radio broadcasting, video journalism, drama production, documentary and feature production, and radio management, in order to create the most skilled staff and best radio program as possible. Finally, to see the community grow to its highest potential, it has established a daycare for kids of the ages 3 months – 2 years, the Children’s Radio Education Workshop (CREW) program targets the development of the youth (ages 6-18) to mold them into media consumers of the future, and the Alternative Kurriculum Mentoring Youth (Alkemy) educates listeners between the ages 18-24 on political issues while beginning the basis for philosophical thought. Bush Radio works hard to push for a more knowledgeable pool of community members in the future for South Africa.In The Pink ProgramIn The Pink was a revolutionary concept for African radio; this program was the first widespread gay and lesbian media outlet on the entire continent. The purpose of such a program was to provide “a platform to voice the struggle from the perspective of gay identity” according to it’s main producer, Adrian Alberts. The program allowed for poets, special musical guests and community listeners coping with homosexual struggles to call in and share their stories and inputs on current issues relevant to the overall program’s theme. In The Pink provides an especially deliberative process with a talk show format, striving for the inclusion of a diverse community and general discussions of current gay and lesbian topics and opinions, while maintaining respect for all viewpoints.Youth Against Aids and HIV-Hop ProgramsIn 2000, Bush Radio began the campaign against childhood AIDS, entitled Youth Against Aids (YAA). The purpose of this campaign and radio program was to educate high school students on the issue of HIV/AIDS at that time. The Bush Radio staff also set out to local schools once a month during this campaign to invite students to talk openly about sex-related topics in addition to weekly live shows during lunches. From YAA began a five-week on-air program, called HIV-Hop. This program is what started a mass involvement of teenagers in the broadcasted discussions of the AIDS epidemic. Teens from all over Cape Town, and other local areas, called in to add to the conversations during these programs. On one specific Friday night, a young man called in and began rapping about the AIDS crisis. The following quote is a small excerpt from that broadcast:  “It’s cold and lonely, coz it’s eating you slowlyBrothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, kings and queensIt’s all upon usThe clock is ticking and the score ain’t in our favorPeople are dying it feels like dying is saferThe headlines read, AIDS hit the streetYou gotta open your ears, eyes and know the beatUnprotected sex, sharing needles”  This began the mass of young adults calling Bush Radio to share their rhymes with the community. It also spawned passionate, on-air debates amongst teens about topics related to HIV/AIDS, such as condoms in schools and abstinence until marriage. After January 2002, the YAA and HIV-Hop programs ended, but in its place began a new program called Positive Living, which a more traditional and permanent broadcast of medical advice from experts about HIV/AIDS and other issues of the present.Bush Radio TodayCurrently, Bush Radio features six different discussion-based programs, including The Breakfast Show, The Morning Cruise, Sakhisizwe – bou die nasie (building the nation), Backchat with Bassie, Everyday People, and CREW. There are also 11 specialty music programs presented throughout different times in the week. Bush Radio also outreaches to a larger audience by offering the option of listening live from their website, as well as following their various social media pages. Bush Radio has won several awards for their unique integration of deliberation amongst community members through the radio, including the Prince Claus Award for Urban Heroes in 2000 and the second place award in the New York International Radio Festival in 2001 for HIV-Hop. They have also been honored with several awards from the Department of Communication in 2005, such as Best Provincial Achiever.Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

The basic idea is that all citizens from different parts in the society should be able to influence important issues both directly and indirectly straight into parliament through an internet based democracy system.  The party wants to introduce direct-democracy in Sweden by running for election. Once elected, the party’s mandate will be used in accordance with the voting results for each and every question with the party’s own direct democratic voting system. In this way direct democracy will be adapted in the pace wanted by the voters. The day the party has a superior majority in the Parliament of state nothing hinders proposals of abolishing the party system and convert Sweden to a downright direct democratic state.  Despite the fact that highly coloured statements in specific factual matters can find expression through the voting system of the party, the aim for the party is to remain neutral by its own. This means that the party neither now nor in the future will adapt any values in issues not specifically involved in how the world-political system will be more direct democratic.  The core activity of the party consequently consists of design, running, maintenance and introduction of a continuous direct-democratic voting system. Everyone that can vote in the general elections can also vote in said voting system. You don’t even have to vote in elections for the party to be able to use the voting system.  The party will also work on solutions for all practical problems that can occur during use of the voting system. Since the voting system only will be accessible through terminals on a network, it is important to make sure that everybody to a reasonable cost can get access to such terminals and knowledge on how to use them. Among other issues, the party wants all libraries to work as voting offices where those who not have access to the network from home can give their votes. The librarians will be trained so they can show the voters how the system works.History  Founded in 2002. Has participated in elections for the Swedish and EU government. Got less than 100 votes in the last national election.External LinksAktivdemokrati.seDirect Democracy organisationsDirect_Democracy  organisations present on Participedia ",2,0,0,0,0,

Mission and PurposeThe objective of this American Political Science Association (APSA) Task Force was to interrogate assumptions and spark debate about the intersection of democracy, economic security, and social justice, through focusing on democratic innovations in three main areas: human rights-based approaches to democratization, welfare, and development, participatory governance, and economic citizenship (APSA Task Force Report, 2012). These areas were chosen due to APSA’s belief that they offered “a robust and compelling account of democracy” (Ibid).Origins and DevelopmentThe Task Force was initiated in 2011 by Carole Pateman, President of the APSA, in response to three major world developments which highlighted the relevance of democracy, economic security, and social justice (APSA Task Force Report, 2012). Firstly, the 2008 global economic crisis “brought economic insecurity home to developed countries and highlighted that increasing inequality coupled with decreasing regulation is unsustainable.” (University of Pittsburgh, 2018) Secondly, a history of failed development interventions based on neo-liberal market reforms signaled that they were not the correct remedy to reduce poverty or encourage economic growth (Ibid). Finally, “China's “success in achieving sustained growth and reducing poverty…revived the idea that authoritarian regimes can deliver greater economic security and social justice than their democratic rivals.” (Ibid) The Task Force viewed the above developments as an opportunity to re-open debates about democracy, economic security, and social justice by focusing on emerging democratic innovations.Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingSpecializations, Methods and ToolsMajor Projects and EventsAnalysis and Lessons LearnedPublicationsSee AlsoReferencesExternal Linkshttps://www.apsanet.org/democraticimperativeshttps://www.apsanet.org/portals/54/Files/Task%20Force%20Reports/TF_DemocracyReport_Final1D_150.pdfhttps://www.ucis.pitt.edu/esc/content/democracy-economic-security-and-social-justice-volatile-worldNotes",2,0,0,0,0,

The organization works with activists, legislators, media, opinion leaders and voters to protect the initiative and referendum process where it exists in 24 states and to expand the process to the 26 states where voters currently lack that right.  There never has been a more important time to defend the initiative process. Voters increasingly turn to initiatives to make needed reforms, while legislators increasingly seek to impose limitations on this process.  Over the next two election cycles, Citizens in Charge seeks to significantly diminish the currently relentless legislative attacks on petition rights and to promote aggressive legislative campaigns to open up the initiative, referendum and recall process for greater use by citizens.  Effectively advancing the ballot initiative process requires changing the current voter-legislator dynamic. The keys to producing such a reversal are:Building grassroots coalitions and recruiting citizen leaders in each initiative state,  Bringing greater public attention to the initiative process and legislative attacks on it, and  Identifying legislative supporters, and highlighting legislative opponents.Legislators understand that undermining initiative rights is unpopular, but they have rarely faced organized opposition, much less paid any political price for their actions. This is changing. Citizens in Charge offers an online legislative action center (Action Team) that:Gives supporters timely email alerts about legislation and events concerning the ballot initiative process in their state, county and city;  Allows leaders to network, sharing ideas across state-lines;  Promotes citizen contact with legislators regarding specific bills and support for the initiative process; and  Provides tools for recruiting other friends and relatives in support of ballot initiative rights.

In recent years, initiatives have been used by well-funded, right-wing donors and special interests to deny rights to working families, public education, women, LGBT people, communities of color, immigrants, and the poor.  At the same time, we recognize that well-crafted ballot measures can become tools that truly represent communities and people whose elected representatives cannot or will not stand up for them. Initiatives and referenda, used this way, can be a force for good public policy and spur increases in voter turnout by those who are too often ignored by the broader electoral establishment.  The qualification process varies in each of the 24 initiative states and based on the type of initiative. Learn more about the types of initiatives or how to qualify.

In particular, this means direct democracy application to the indirectly democratic won seats in that citizens' constant and directly monitor and control the delegates.

IDE plans the on-going relay of the discussion in parliament, and to empower citizens to vote online about the topics discussed.

The delegates in parliament representing the party:1. will be chosen by lottery from those applying to serve as delegates of the party.2. those who win the lottery will serve as representatives on a rotating basis such that each will fill the seat for a month in case of the European Parliament, and or two months in case of the national government. In the European Parliament, where delegates are categorized by their party, IDE will be categorized as independent.3. will reflect the citizens' resolution when they vote in the parliament by voting in parliament according to the citizens' decisions on IDE's homepage.Differences of opinion within IDE will be reflected in the positions taken in parliament by IDE delegates. For example, if a pending bill is supported by 60% of IDE member and is opposed by 40% and IDE has 10 seats in parliament, then six delegates would support and four would oppose the bill. [edit] The relation of IDE and the other parties Since IDE doesn’t have its own political measures, as a matter of course doesn’t make coalition with other parties.

Year 2011 is a tiebreaker in Finnish politics. Lisbon agreement and the possible vote threshold coming into force will make the parliamentary elections of 2011 the last election where citizens are heard.  Western style democracy, the core belief of Change 2011, is further enhanced with so called direct democracy where citizens have a direct input in the decision-making process.  Main goal of the Change 2011 movement is to advance the interest of Finnish citizens. This is achieved by decision makers i.e. politicians following the will of the people. Change 2011 is trying to achieve this by offering direct democracy to support representative or parliamentary democracy and by extending the right to freedom of speech to include present day political dissidents.  Change 2011 has identified several areas where the decision maker’s actions and public opinion is in conflict. Out of these present-day problems we will emphasize immigration policy, the unhealthy consensus political system and unreasonably lenient convictions for violent crimes offenders.1. Advancing the interest of Finnish citizens  The most important task of the state of Finland is to protect the rights of its citizens. Prosperity and wealth is to be primarily spread amongst citizens. Funds collected by means of taxes are to be used for the wellbeing of citizens. In case of excess, it can be used for the benefit of other countries and their citizens. Tax income is to be used to the benefit of aging citizens and to ensure their quality of life as well as childcare and youth education. Other important targets are medical care, day-care opportunities for children and homeless people.  People are to be treated according to equality principle. People are not to be discriminated because of sex, age, ethnic origin, language, religion, conviction, opinion, health, handicap or other personal reason. Change 2011 does not accept special treatment of individuals or organisations at the expense of other individuals or groups in contradiction of the equality principle. Favouritism is a form of discrimination.2. Direct democracy to support parliamentary democracy  Important decisions affecting the nation are done by means of direct democracy. The final decision then rests with Finnish citizens with right to vote.  Such decisions would be the decision to join NATO or accepting the Lisbon agreement.  The 3 pillars of direct democracy are citizen’s initiatives, popular vote or referendum and selecting civil servants holding key positions.  Prescribed or predetermined number of citizens can initiate a Citizens initiative. If the initiative receives sufficient support it will then be subject to a referendum or popular vote.  Key civil servants such as the parliamentary ombudsman and prosecutor general of Finland, have a significant role in legislative process. Thus it is imperative to increase direct input in selecting these key civil servants.  Direct democracy referendums are easily run in parallel with municipal, parliamentary, EU-parliamentary and presidential elections, including Internet based elections. Out of the European nations, Switzerland is an established user of direct democracy both in principle and practice.3. Freedom of speech includes dissidents and those expressing opinions different from mainstream  Freedom of speech is the cornerstone and livelihood of democracy. Restrictions to freedom of speech only advance the interest and goals of small groups. These same restrictions prevent dissidents from being heard. Freedom of speech should not only cover those ideas and thoughts that are well received and considered harmless or are generally ignored. Freedom of speech includes such messages and material that could potentially insult, shock or disturb the state or part of its population. This type of thinking provides for a solid foundation of an open pluralistic and democratic society.4. Retirement of consensus politics  Present systems of consensus politics are incapable of political and economical reforms. The system is unable to view matters from alternative perspectives. Most of all, consensus politics is incapable of unbiased and constructive dialogue. Prime minister and minister of finance without due process decide many important issues affecting the whole nation. Amongst the results of the many years of consensus is the almost total lack of critical media and intellectuals capable of constructive dialogue and questioning of the establishment along with a moral values undermining individual liberties and values of citizens as well as refusing to address historical matters and a clear cover up to protect the interest of small political elite in the case of STASI related matters and Rosenholz material to be specific.5. Rationalization of immigration politics  The aim of Change 2011 is a safe and economically stable Finland. Our critique concerning immigration politics and policy is directed to the government and parliament with legislative responsibility. Same laws and legality standards must be applied to all residents.  Immigration in general must be economically profitable for the country. Most of immigrants today fall under humanitarian migration group. This group is not governed or required by obligations to UN. Humanitarian immigration is a homemade invention of Finnish civil servants and authorities. Finland has no international obligations regarding humanitarian immigration. Parliament must pass an immigration or law pertaining to aliens where the key point is to guarantee the interest of citizens and the state. Prior to accepting this law a referendum binding the parliament must be held. Our operations program regarding immigration will lay the foundation for the new immigration and aliens law.6. Just convictions for violent crimes  Being too lenient, convictions handed out by courts on violent crimes against persons, their life and health do not correspond the legal opinion of majority of citizens. Serious violent crimes include but are not limited to: murder, attempted murder, aggravated assault, sexual crimes and driving under the influence leading to manslaughter.  Problems do not lie in deficient laws but rather how these laws are implemented. Especially youth crime must be interfered with at early stages and with strong measures. Preventive measures will stop many youths from falling into criminal life. Citizens right to self-defence, to defend family and property must be increased. One being subject to a violent crime must have a full right to self-defence with all means appropriate.  Direct_Democracy  organisations present on Participedia ",1,0,0,0,0,

The people of Ireland previously did have Direct Democratic powers in the Constitution of the Irish Free State (1922). In this Constitution, Articles 47 &amp; 48 gave the sovereign people of Ireland the power to initiate referendum. In the same document, Article 50 gave the Oireachtas the power to amend the constitution if the newly amended constitution is put up for a referendum vote within 2 years. In 1928 the Irish Democracy was severely weakened when the presiding Oireachtas amended the constitution by removing Articles 47 &amp; 48. This one act ended the people’s right to initiate referendum as a way to have a final say in the political decision making process.  The goal of Direct Democracy Ireland organisation is to create a political party that will field candidates, in all constituencies, in the next General Election. The aim of Direct Democracy Ireland is to introduce a system of direct democracy in Ireland, which will entail, at a minimum, the right of the people to:  1. Initiative – Any citizen can collect a certain number of signatures, (a certain % of the population), to call a referendum.  2. Referendum – The referendum will empower the people to negate Ministerial decisions, or Government legislation, such as NAMA.  3. Recall – A mechanism will also be introduced whereby politicians can be ‘fired’ if they are not performing their job to the satisfaction of the electorate.Direct_Democracy  on Participedia ",2,0,0,0,0,

By this request, the association asks simply for the implementation of the articles 6 and 14 of the French Declaration on the rights of man and citizen of 1789 which is a part of the present Constitution. This implementation would give a harmonious coexistence of representative and direct democracy. The association’s founders claim that only such reform will get France out of the political impasses and the reigning oligarchy.  First of all, the association acts to inform the French and European countries citizens about the mechanisms of direct democracy as it works in Switzerland, Liechtenstein, in the United States of America (local and state levels), in Italy and Germany (local and Länder levels). The association can organize information and petitions, especially at local level.

Présentation résumée par Yvan Blot  Animateur du site :  www.democratiedirecte.frPrésident de l’association « Agir Pour La Démocratie Directe »  Contact :  atheneion@free.frExtension géographique  La démocratie directe qui permet au peuple, et pas seulement à ses représentants élus, d’abroger ou d’adopter des lois, est encore très minoritaire dans le monde. C’est la démocratie représentative pure, où seuls les représentants élus du peuple adoptent formellement les lois, qui demeure encore la règle de droit commun.  La démocratie directe fonctionne depuis 1848 en Suisse (au niveau fédéral, cantonal et local) et aux Etats-Unis (au niveau de 26 Etats fédérés sur 50 et au niveau local). Le petit Liechtenstein la pratique aussi. Depuis 1970, le référendum d’initiative populaire pour abroger une loi existe en Italie. Depuis la réunification allemande du 3 octobre 1990, la démocratie directe a été progressivement introduite dans les tous les Länder allemands et souvent aussi au niveau communal. Peu à peu, la démocratie directe gagne en extension.Outils de la démocratie directe  Il y a deux outils essentiels, le référendum veto et l’initiative populaire, un frein et un moteur. Le référendum veto consiste à permettre au peuple d’annuler une loi votée par le parlement. Il faut une pétition de citoyens, (50 000 en Suisse, 500 000 en Italie) qui demande l’annulation de la loi. Si le nombre minimum de signatures est atteint, un débat est lancé et le référendum populaire a lieu environ six mois plus tard. Si le non l’emporte, la loi est annulée. Si le « oui » l’emporte, la loi est confirmée. C’est un frein pour s’assurer que les élus ne votent pas une loi que la majorité des citoyens réprouve, ce qui peut arriver compte tenu des puissants lobbies qui font aujourd’hui pression sur le gouvernement ou le parlement. C’est un moyen de redonner la parole aux citoyens non organisés en lobbies, en groupes de pression.  L’initiative populaire est une pétition pour soumettre au référendum un projet de loi voulu par les citoyens signataires sur un sujet que le gouvernement ou le parlement ignorent ou ont peur d’aborder. En Suisse, le chiffre pour qu’une pétition soit valable a été relevé à 100 000 signatures. Aux Etats-Unis, le chiffre à atteindre est un pourcentage des électeurs, et il varie selon les Etats. Si le nombre de signatures est atteint, un débat est organisé sur les medias et le parlement donne son avis sur le projet en question. Il peut aussi rédiger un contre-projet qui sera soumis le même jour au référendum. Ainsi, le parlement n’est nullement mis à l’écart. La démocratie directe organise plutôt une saine concurrence entre les citoyens et les élus pour faire les lois : personne ne doit être exclu alors que la démocratie représentative pure exclut les citoyens de la fonction législative.Pratique  La pratique varie beaucoup selon les Etats. En Suisse ou au Liechtenstein, tout sujet, y compris fiscal, peut être abordé. Aux Etats-Unis, c’est le cas dans le domaine de compétence de la commune ou de l’Etat fédéré car il n’y a pas de démocratie directe au niveau fédéral à l’inverse de la Suisse. En Italie (au niveau national) ou dans les Länder allemands, les sujets traitant des dépenses publiques ou des impôts sont exclus de la démocratie directe.  Il y a eu en Suisse des référendums ou des initiatives sur les sujets les plus divers comme le financement de la sécurité sociale, l’adhésion ou non à l’Union Européenne, la construction de minarets, l’adoption de la TVA, les 35 heures, et même la suppression de l’armée (rejetée).  Aux Etats-Unis, les grands sujets ces dernières années ont été les réductions d’impôts (la fameuse proposition 13 en Californie qui s’est ensuite diffusée dans les autres Etats), la protection de l’environnement, la lutte contre la criminalité, la peine de mort, l’avortement ou l’enseignement. Aux Etats-Unis, le citoyen conserve la possibilité de faire un recours contre le résultat d’un référendum devant la Cour Suprême d’un Etat pour violation des droits de l’homme alors que rien de semblable n’existe en Suisse. En Allemagne, le contrôle de constitutionnalité est préalable à la tenue du référendum pour éviter que le juge casse une décision populaire sortie des urnes.  En Italie, il y a eu des référendums sur le divorce, l’échelle mobile des salaires (rejetée) notamment. En Allemagne, il y a eu des référendums sur les lois électorales, l’enseignement de la religion à l’école, l’urbanisme (faut-il autoriser la construction de tours en centre ville ?)Effets  Des études universitaires très poussées en Suisse, en Allemagne aux USA notamment ont montré que les décisions du peuple étaient toujours modérées et raisonnables. Par exemple, les Suisses ont rejeté des mesures démagogiques comme l’adoption des 35H ou bien la suppression de l’armée.  Sur le plan des finances publiques, les travaux des professeurs Feld et Kirchgässner ont montré en étudiant les résultats des référendums financiers aux USA et dans les cantons suisses que là où la démocratie directe existe, les impôts et les dépenses publiques sont un tiers plus bas que dans les pays où la démocratie est purement représentative. L’endettement public est de moitié plus faible. Ce résultat est d’une extrême importance.Objections courantes  Les adversaires à la démocratie directe allèguent la non-maturité et la désinformation des citoyens. Ceci n’est pas du tout avéré par les études empiriques qui portent sur près d’un siècle de pratique référendaire en Suisse et aux Etats-Unis. Le référendum donne l’occasion au citoyen d’exprimer ce qu’il vit tous les jours d’où un degré d’information et de bon sens élevé. Par contre, le citoyen, lors d’une élection, vote souvent par mimétisme et non par expérience personnelle. Hitler est arrivé au pouvoir grâce à des élections parlementaires et non par un référendum. L’élection offre par rapport au référendum moins de garanties de rationalité car le citoyen est plus rationnel pour répondre à une question concrète que pour choisir un homme.Circonstances d’adoption  A chaque fois, l’adoption de la démocratie directe s’est faite pour résoudre une crise : révolte populaire en Suisse dans le canton de St Gall, corruption de la classe politique en Californie, débat sur le divorce en Italie, suites de la réunification en Allemagne.

The history of the website and the software developed for it is recounted in this document.  The greatest strength of the system is that it uses the opinions of its users (crowd-sourceing) to evaluate the importance, quality and usefulness of the ideas/issues and also crowd-sources the selection of the best arguments/points for and against those ideas/issues. Thus enabling users to make up their minds about most issues in a very short time.  The software behind Skuggaþing, Skuggaborg and Betri Reykjavík is called Open Active Democracy (OAD). It has been in development since November 2008 and has gone through various versions.  The first version of Skuggaþing (which blends ideas and law proposals from users with the official proposals from the Icelandic Parliament) opened in January 2009, it’s current version opened in February 2010 and Skuggaborg/Betri Reykjavík (ShadowCity/Better Reykjavik) in May 2010. In the beginning of 2010 the Open Source software Nationbuilder was merged with it and the name changed. The OAD software is Open Source and uses a Gnu license. The developers were awarded a 2 million IS krónur grant from the Icelandic Parliament.  We created a website for the unofficial Ministry of Ideas (Hugmyndaráðuneytið), this website won the SVEF (the Icelandic Web Industry Association) Award in 2010 for the most original website. We have engaged in talks with interested authorities about using their own version of Better Reykjavík. We are now working with the City of Reykjavik on a new version of Better Reykjavik with a better user interface and integration with the administrative system. Proposed opening is in April 2011.  We were asked to develop a collaborative website for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the Icelandic application which will open in February 2011. The website is intended to ensure that all viewpoints regarding the application will be put forth and give the general public a chance to state their opinions.  Other current projects include a grant application website for the Ministry of Education where the grant appliers rate which projects should receive grants and an unofficial and pro-bono Stjórnlagaþing (Constitutional Assembly) website to give the public a platform to voice and grade their ideas for a new constitution. In March 2010 we started a collaboration with the Icelandic Prime Ministers Office to make data from the governments 20/20 project available for public crowd sourceing which will be opened as soon as the data is made available. We have established a non-profit organisation called  Íbúar.is  (Citizens) which will be responsible for our websites. It is and will be a neutral entity that has as its main to objective to foster collaboration between those who rule and those who are ruled.

Its politics aren’t left wing or right wing and neither are they centrist. Newid can’t be put in a box, because it represents an entirely different approach to the way we, the people, govern Wales.  Newid is organised like a political party because it aims to bring about change in the conventional way, through the ballot box. But its members and supporters share a common interest – changing our political system to establish a demarchy, a more advanced form of democracy in which elections are not necessary and there is no need for politicians or political parties.  None of us have joined Newid because we lust after power or because we want a career in politics. We’re in this to create better opportunities for our families, our communities and Welsh society as a whole.  We believe that the true purpose of government is to represent the will of the people rather than the whims of a detached, self-interested political elite. We’re determined to establish a sovereign government that will enable Wales to flourish both culturally and economically.  Newid will never force its members to vote in a particular way. It rejects party political dogma and encourages its members and supporters to engage in free and rational deliberation. We want people to express their own views and vote according to their consciences, so we oppose all forms of coercion.  Winning control of the Senedd is central to Newid’s objective of establishing a demarchy. Once we have an overall majority in the Senedd, a referendum will be held on a written constitution that sets out the rights and responsibilities of every Welsh citizen. Approval of the constitution will constitute a mandate to conclude a settlement with the Westminster government and establish an independent demarchy.  Whereas the traditional parties strive to attain and maintain power, Newid seeks power only to place it in the hands of ordinary people. As soon as we’ve achieved our aims, we’ll throw a big party to celebrate and then disband. There’ll no longer be a need for politicians or political parties and Wales will be a far better place for it. ",0,0,0,0,0,

But our ultimate goal is to form a viable system for independent citizens, so that when you go to vote, you can skip all the political parties and vote for yourself.  PROGRAM STRANKE NEPOSREDNE DEMOKRACIJE SVOJPOLITIK.SIA ) Začetek in konec stranke  1.) Vzpostavitev sistema za samostojne državljane  Stranka neposredne demokracije Svojpolitik.si se ustanovi z namenom, da se politični sistem Republike Slovenije nadgradi na takšen način, da volivci na volitvah niso več prisiljeni oddati svoj glas nekomu ali biti pasivni, temveč lahko svoj glas obdržijo zase in se odločajo ter oddajajo predloge preko zaščitenega elektronskega sistema (npr. preko certifikata SIGEN-CA). Volilni lističi se zato spremenijo tako, da se na vprašanje: »Koga bi volili?«, doda odgovor sebe. Ko volivec obkroži to možnost in na volilni listek dopiše še svoje ime in priimek ter EMŠO, s tem postane samostojen državljan, ki ima nato 1/število volilnih upravičencev moči pri odločanju v predstavniškem organu, za katerega so bile razpisane volitve (velja za nacionalne in lokalne volitve, EU nivo je iz tega logično izključen).  Za primer volitev v državni zbor 2008 je izračun sledeč. Volilnih upravičencev je bilo tedaj 1.696.437, če to število delimo z 90 poslanci, dobimo izračun, da vsak poslanec predstavlja 18849,3 volilnih upravičencev. Samostojni državljan bi v tem primeru upravljal z 1/1.696.437 procentom glasov, vsakemu poslancu pa bi se za 1/90 tega zneska zmanjša njegova moč glasovanja.  Če državne institucije preprečijo sprejetje te bistvene točke programa, zahtevamo, da se razreši neustavno stanje, v katerega smo zašli, in se 3. člen ustave, ki pravi, da ima v Sloveniji oblast ljudstvo, spremeni tako, da se zapiše, da ima v Sloveniji oblast ritualno voljena politično/ekonomska oligarhija. Kajti v preteklosti je bila oblast ljudstva omejena s tem, da so fizične oziroma naravne danosti omejevale neposredno odločanje državljanov. Danes, ko že na državnem nivoju priznavamo legalnost elektronskih podpisov pa teh naravnih omejitev ni več. Če je oblast res ljudska, morajo imeti državljani na izbiro vse realne možnosti upravljanja. Kajti, če so ljudje nujno prisiljeni na volitvah predati svojo oblast in izbrati svojega vladarja, čeprav bi si lahko vladali sami, potem oblast ni ljudska, ampak gre tu za navadno diktaturo volitev, s tem pa je kršena tudi pravica do samoodločbe.  Ko se na lokalnem in nacionalnem nivoju vzpostavi delujoč in s strani države podprt sistem namenjen samostojnim državljanom, se stranka neposredne demokracije Svojpolitik.si samoukine, ker ni več smisla, da obstaja. To določilo je zapisano tudi v statutu stranke.B ) Sprejemanje odločitev  2.) Vse odločitve se sprejemajo preko internetnega foruma  Druga pomembna točka programa je, da se vse odločitve stranke Svojpolitik.si sprejemajo preko elektronsko zaščitenega internetnega foruma. Glede na razmerje glasov o določenem predlogu (za ali proti) delegati stranke nato proporcionalno glasujejo v državnem zboru, mestnih ali občinskih svetih. Svojpolitik.si se tako ne omejuje na določen sklop politično/ ekonomskih idej ampak služi kot platforma za različna mnenja, ki imajo tako možnost, da prepričajo ljudi o svoji pravilnosti. Zato je tudi v primerjavi z drugimi programi političnih strank program Svojpolitik.si zelo kratek. Skratka pri te obliki demokratične organizacije gre predvsem za mehanizem odločanja in ne za nek specifično zapisan program, ki bi ga bilo potrebno skorajda sveto zagovarjati. Program oziroma programi in odločitve so zato dinamične in o njih se odloča preko spletnega foruma. Poskrbeli pa bomo, da bo na spletni strani dovolj različnih predlogov, za katere bo mogoče glasovati.  Poleg teh dveh bistvenih točk programa pa v Svojpolitik.si predlagamo še nekaj dodatnih izhodišč, ki bi služila kot ojačitev sistema neposredne demokracije.  3.) Osredotočenost na trajnostni razvoj  Ker je Zemlja ena sama in smatramo, da jo je dobro ohraniti tudi za prihodnje rodove, bomo poskušali spodbujati rešitve, ki ne slonijo na destrukciji družbenega in naravnega okolja.C) Ukinitev nedemokratičnih in pol-demokratičnih sistemskih prvin  4.) Ukinitev državnega sveta  Njegova funkcija in obstoj je dediščina političnega sistema SFRJ, kjer je imela takšna institucija svoj smisel, danes pa predstavlja le izkrivljenost demokratične forme in načela ""en človek en glas"" ter nepotrebne stroške. Interesnim skupinam pa bi tako ali tako še vedno ostala možnost vpliva na odločevalce preko lobiranja.  5.) Sprememba zakona o poslancih  Zakon o poslancih bi bilo potrebno spremeniti tako, da bi po novem poslancu prenehal mandat, če ne bi upošteval volje ljudstva. To bi veljalo le za poslance, ki delujejo v organizacijah, kjer je njihovo delovanje vezano na neposredno demokracijo. Nezaupnico oziroma zaupnico poslancu bi se izglasovalo preko e-glasovanja.  6.) Ukinitev volilnega praga  Zakon o volitvah v državni zbor se spremeni tako, da se ukine sedaj veljavno pravilo, da mora politična stranka doseči minimalno 4% glasov, da se uvrsti v državni zbor. S tem pravilom je zelo otežkočen razvoj novih strank, ker volivci nimajo praktično nobene motivacije, da bi volili manjše in nove politične stranke. Kajti če njihova stranka ne doseže 4% praga, je kot da ne bi glasovali, ker se njihovi glasovi praktično izbrišejo. S tem pa tudi ostanejo brez svojega predstavnika ljudstva, ki bi jim moral pripadati. Z ukinitvijo tega pravila bi v Sloveniji dobili bolj dinamičen in bolj demokratičen politični sistem, ki bi prevetril današnjo okostenelo strankarsko sceno.  7.) Ukinitev praga za financiranje političnih strank iz proračuna  Zakon o političnih strankah se spremeni tako, da se ukine omejitev, ki pravi, da mora politična stranka doseči minimalno 1% glasov volivcev, da ima pravico do financiranja iz državnega proračuna. Na ta način bi vzpodbudili delovanje manjših strank in posledično delovanje opozicije.D) Tehnična podpora sistemu neposredne demokracije  8.) Spremembe v delovanju digitalnih potrdil SIGEN-CA  Digitalna potrdila SIGEN-CA se spremenijo tako, da je iz njih razvidno ali ima oseba volilno pravico, doda se tudi EMŠO imetnika potrdila, ob morebitni smrti imetnika potrdila le to nemudoma preneha veljati. Poleg tega se doda tudi možnost, da lahko preko SIGEN-CA potrdila elektronsko pooblastite tretjo osebo, da lahko preveri vaše osebne podatke zbrane v centralnem registru prebivalstva. S temi spremembami pisno pošiljanje vlog preko klasične pošte ne bi bilo več potrebno, bistveno pa bi bil hitrejši tudi celotni postopek registracije na forumu Svojpolitik.si.  9.) Uvedba e-volitev in e-referendumov  Uvedba elektronskih volitev na lokalnem nivoju in v državni zbor ter uvedba elektronskih referendumov. Večkrat že obljubljeno, nikoli realizirano.  10.) Brezplačen internetni dostop za vse državljane  Ker verjamemo, da je pravica komunicirati osnovna človekova pravica in je ideja Svojpolitik.si vezana na internetni dostop, bi v okviru države organizirali brezplačni osnovni dostop do interneta (npr. ADSL) za vse državljane.  11.) Državna shema za nakup računalnika Iz podobnih razlogov bi država financirala shemo za ugoden nakup osebnih računalnikov.  12.) Ustanovitev centrov za glasovanje  Ustanovili bi se tudi posebni centri za glasovanje z dostopom do računalnikov in interneta, ki bi bili locirani v prostorih občin ali četrtnih skupnosti.Direct Democracy organisationsDirect_Democracy  organisations present on Participedia ",0,0,0,0,0,

[2]Founding and governing principlesThe Online Party of Canada is a  non-partisan  political party founded on the principles of  electronic direct democracy  where members vote directly on specific issues via the party website and, in return, party officials (candidates) must support the majority position on every issue, regardless of their personal position.To ensure accountability, all OPC representatives must write up their own Promissory Letter of Resignation before being eligible to run for office. Any OPC representative who would then vote against the will of the majority could be asked to step down and resign. [3]  [4]  [5]  [6]  [7]Political PlatformThe Online Party of Canada does not have a set agenda. The political platform is a compilation of issues and issue positions from the OPC website, voted from members and grouped by issue category, e.g. economic, healthcare, environment etc. The key aspect of the platform is the importance given to certain categories, however, particular issues and respective positions are determined solely based on members’ votes. [8]  [9]MembershipUnlike most recognized political parties, all eligible voters in Canada, even cardholding members of other federal political parties, are allowed and strongly encouraged to become members of OPC in order to cast votes and comment on issues. In this sense, the Online Party of Canada is more like to a virtual  House of Commons , representing all political stripes, rather than a traditional political party.To ensure that each voting citizen only cast a single vote on each issue, only Members' votes count toward the official party position and members are only authenticated once a signed paper form, recognized by  Elections Canada , is submitted to the OPC. [10]  Through this process, every OPC member and their respective  electoral district  as voting citizens is verifiable through the National Register of Electors (the Register) [11] , similar to the voter idenfication process followed by Elections Canada during Federal Elections.See alsoTemplate:Portal boxDirect democracye-DemocracyReferences↑""Online Party of Canada - Contact Us"" .  https://www.onlineparty.ca/contact.php .↑""Internet download limit slashed for many"" .

The political agenda of the party will depend entirely on people’s decision, determined by means of referenda and initiatives organized by the party. These organized systems will thus allow citizens to vote on propositions of laws submitted by elected members of parliament, but also to propose new laws.  The main role of the party will be to organize referenda and initiatives:Referenda will allow people to vote on new laws proposed by the parliament.  Initiatives will allow people to propose new laws by themselves. When a new law is proposed by a sufficiently large group of citizens then people are allowed to vote on it, like in referenda.We plan to take full advantage of the extraordinary potential that internet can offer us with respect to democracy. Votes will be organized at least partly on a dedicated website with a fully secured voting system (ex.  End_to_end_auditable_voting_system_""Helios"" ). Users will register by means of their electronic ID card or another registration method in order to validate their identity at the time of registration. Then they will have access to a database of laws proposed by the elected representatives or submitted by other citizens, accompanied by clear explanations. They will be allowed to participate in discussions on the forum and to vote on these laws, if they want to.  The results of these referenda will be published and will determine the party line, which will then guide our elected representatives.The MissionThe mission for Electronic Direct Democracy (E2D) International is simply:to help establish, to support and promote, and to maintain communication and co-operation between politically-neutral electronic direct democracy parties around the world.An Electronic Direct Democracy (E2D) Manifesto  (DRAFT)  The following are basic guiding principles to be implemented by political parties founded on the basis of  Electronic Direct Democracy (EDD).

The effect generated by each of these ideas is the change in relationships, the reappropriation of spaces, making collective capacities visible, valuing everyday space by generating material transformations, of meaning and densification of civil society from the local.Problems and PurposeThe Cerro Cordillera, at the height of the Camino Cintura, was one of the first popular settlements in Valparaíso, this town stands out for its deep port tradition, of union and worker organization.In recent decades, the hill has been impoverished by the aging of its inhabitants, the unemployment of youth and the prevalence of drug use (SUBDERE, CIC &amp; GTZ., 2008).The problems identified by the locality in its beginnings were mainly related to the deterioration and non-existence of public spaces, the presence of garbage dumps in streams, with a high sanitary deficit and infections in the community. Within the social aspects, there was low participation and mistrust in the existing leaders.The conditions of employment and habitability were deficient, as well as the lack of community equipment and infrastructure (Fundación Hábitat Colombia, 2005).In this scenario, in 1998, a group of founding partners of the Community Action Workshop (TAC), toured different hills of Valparaíso, looking for a space with neighborhood life where to generate a local development project, with the aim of rebuilding links community and improve the living conditions of its inhabitants. In this sense, the Cordillera hill fulfilled these potentials, in terms of its historical trajectory, and the presence of various social organizations and local institutions that could participate in the initiative, and its inhabitants had a level of basic needs covered. The latter made it possible to generate a project focused on community and non-welfare development.Since its inception its purpose was to promote community development, through participation in concrete initiatives of local incidence, its intervention model starts from the base of education, formal or informal training on health, environment, market, culture. This comprehensive development includes the material improvement of the habitat and the neighborhood environment. His work is aimed at children, youth, women, adults, the elderly, neighbors, organizations, functional and / or territorial institutions (TAC Magazine, 2009).HistoryThe beginnings of the TAC go back to 1989, a period in which it constituted a work program of the NGO CECAP (Centro de Capacitación y Asesoría Poblacional), which was aimed at promoting the development of community life in poor localities of the city. Valparaíso (TAC Magazine, 2009).In the first stage, his work on the Cordillera hill was oriented to the development of a self-diagnosis, where leaders, residents and grassroots organizations participated to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the neighborhood. Among the priorities to work are recognized: to generate conditions that facilitate the encounter and participation in the local development process, demonstrate in concrete actions in the territory possibilities of transformation, recognize and value the local space (Library CF + S, 2006).In 1990 the organization was located in a gorge in the Cordillera that had been turned into a garbage dump for more than 40 years. Cleaning days were started where the community was invited to participate. Once recovered, the first square was consolidated and the first murals inspired by local history were made.This period was essential to generate mutual trust between the organization, neighborhood leaders, local organizations and schools in the sector (TAC Magazine, 2009).In the 1990s, the majority of non-governmental organizations in the country began to receive a decrease in financial resources, despite this, the TAC continues to move forward and decides to become an autonomous institution of CECAP, from which the work begins to be sustained. in Associativity and local participation, highlighting the work and permanence of the founding team of the initiative. Since this year the organization begins to sustain itself through voluntary action and specific projects, this change in operation lays the foundations that have given it sustainability over time (Cerda &amp; Rojas, 2004).In this period the strategy is to coordinate with the actors around the territory, recovering the physical spaces through planning meetings and mutual knowledge. Strengthening the sense of community takes a central role from the articulation of local organizations, educational establishments and the health clinic (CF + S Library, 2006).Between 1996 and 1998, they are considered as the years of consolidation of the project and projection of the TAC, a process of systematization of the experience begins and work begins on the dissemination of the work carried out on a local and communal scale through posters, bulletins, links with the press and stable workshops with the educational establishments of the commune.At the end of this stage, the amphitheater in the recovered ravine is finished, where a collective and local space for culture capable of housing 600 people is consolidated, more than 1000 people participate in its construction.The fourth stage, from 1999 to 2001, is recognized as the period where there is already a legitimation of the intervention model. The organization is concerned with the construction of means of dissemination and educational material, internships and meetings are held with different actors in the territory. At the end of this cycle, the 31st summer school takes place, where the majority of young people from the Andes, former children become monitors, this milestone is important to mention, since these young people are the ones who begin to organize and generate significant changes in the territory later (TAC Magazine, 2009).This last period, from 2002 to 2009, has been focused on reviewing what has been done and on the work of replicating the intervention model in academic, public and other local realities.The main actors have been children, young people, volunteers, the cordillera network, universities and public organizations.The management of resources in this last period has been through projects, voluntary action, local participation, associativism, development of cooperation agreements with national and foreign universities and public organizations (TAC Magazine, 2009).Organizational Structure and FundingThe sustainability of this experience is given by its intervention model that is based on an associative structure through the Cordillera network made up of different organizations that represent different areas of the territory.Once the TAC is established in Cordillera, it promotes the articulation and coordination of these existing organizations. This platform has been strategic for local empowerment, linkage of actors and feedback with the environment, guiding the work towards the vision of a jointly designed and concretized community development.The organizational figure of the Community Action Workshop is structured in three levels; the directory in charge of delivering general strategic guidelines, both for educational work and for management; the central team, responsible for designing educational work with schools and management tasks; and the field work team, in charge of planning the specific activities to be carried out in each work session with the schools.We can understand the structure of the network from different spheres of participation. In its center, we identify the TAC as a linking agent of the network, articulating in a first sphere of local participation, made up of more active organizations within planning and decision-making in the territory, among them we identify the Union&#39;s working population, the Red Cross, local volunteers, clinic, parish and 12 public schools. Also incorporating peripheral organizations such as sports clubs, police, mothers&#39; centers and the different neighborhood associations (Cerda &amp; Rojas, 2004).In a second sphere of participation, we identify the extra-local actors made up of collaborating companies, volunteers, public services and associated universities (Cerda &amp; Rojas, 2004).As leading actors, children, young people and volunteers are recognized, who are constant participants, from the comprehensive program that is carried out throughout the year with the associated schools and the workshops given in the summer and winter schools.Regarding the selection of participants, we identified 4 categories: self-selection, rather natural selection in the case of volunteers, who get involved and acquire responsibilities according to their level of commitment and time availability. In the case of targeted recruitment, we identify the courses of the schools selected to participate during the year in the comprehensive program taught by the TAC, thirdly are the stakeholders, made up of the leaders of social organizations, who actively participate within the net. Finally, within the second sphere of participation are the professional interest groups made up of NGOs, public and private organizations that participate in technical tables, fairs, internships and seminars, which always participate voluntarily, without being paid.Specializations and ActivitiesIts lines of action are the following (SUBDERE, CIC &amp; GTZ., 2008):1) Articulation of the Local and Communal network through the generation of associative relationships between different organizations, expanding the vision of the territory by sharing and exchanging learning.2) Prevention actions in children and young people through workshops that promote the good use of free time in concrete actions for the improvement and recovery of the physical and social environment.3) Education and environmental improvement, children and young people are constituted as agents in the process of recovery and transformation of spaces from a methodology of education in action.4) Cultural action, articulating the spaces of expression and diffusion of culture in the hills through the creation of murals.5) Rescue of local identity, we work from workshops, recovery and restoration of heritage landmarks aimed at rescuing and valuing tangible and intangible heritage, strengthening and recognizing the construction of the history that constitutes them.6) Recovery and improvement of public spaces, this line of action has been consolidated over time through the conquest of new spaces for public use (garbage dumps, empty sites, parking lots).7) Community library, the use of free time is promoted in spaces oriented to culture and technology.8) Strengthening of voluntary action, through citizen exercise based on local development, self-management and civic responsibility. Currently a network of volunteers from the same locality, from universities and foreigners is formed.9) Extension, the exchange of experiences and learning with other initiatives is promoted through fairs, internships, seminars, forums and educational visits at the local, communal, regional, national and international levels.The purpose and lines of action of the TAC are specified in an educational space complementary to the formal one, focused mainly on children and young people through three instances:1) Comprehensive Program: stable workshops that are constituted in weekly work sessions with courses from the various participating establishments, aimed at children and young people between 3 and 25 years old, corresponding to basic, special and integrated schools and kindergartens.In these sessions various topics are addressed, which are linked to the problems and concerns that have arisen in the field of formal education.The activities take place during class hours, forming part of the academic curriculum of the establishments. Each course attends the TAC once a week and the working day lasts an hour and a half.2) Seasonal schools: They correspond to various workshops that take place simultaneously for periods of 4 to 12 consecutive days, normally held during winter and summer holidays, and are aimed at children and young people between 5 and 25 years old, from schools associated with the network, the local and extra-local community.The daily work day runs from 9 in the morning to 4:30 in the afternoon, including a space for breakfast, lunch and a snack.3) Thematic workshops: this strategy is aimed at developing workshops associated with specific themes, the implementation of which is occasional. The duration of the workshops is defined based on a relevant number of sessions agreed upon by the participating actors, including children, young people from the schools associated with the network, adults in general, women, the elderly, leaders of social organizations. and territorial (Cerda &amp; Rojas, 2004).Major Projects and EventsTo put in context the mechanisms used in decision-making promoted by the vision of the TAC, it is important to expose the local action methodology that the organization has developed in these 21 years and that has been promoted from three perspectives of work in the territory.In the first place, the Associativity, through the exchange of experiences, horizontality, flexibility and permanence in time of the Cordillera network. The associative links between the different organizations have made it possible to mobilize local resources (mainly physical and human).Second, the local participation of the different organizations and volunteers jointly build the strategies, plans, projects and actions. This has allowed over time a strong appropriation of the spaces gained, strengthening community ties and social relations with actors outside the community (Cerda &amp; Rojas, 2004).In this context we identify the type of participation at the level of co-management associations or rather co-construction, since this initiative has strengthened the bonds and the social capital of the locality, constituting new leaders and new forms of organization.The interaction between the participants and decision-making is deliberative and of sum of preferences, that is, the mode of communication is through the exchange of visions, information and learning, it seeks to reach an agreement based on arguments and consensus through collective participation .The TAC management style promotes democratic, transformational and participatory leadership, generating a sense of belonging and human bonds.The spaces for participation have been consolidated over time, through assemblies, work tables, workshops, where the main actors are citizens in general, public authorities, community leaders, volunteers, children and young people.In general terms, it is possible to identify a decision-making process that includes different phases, which has been called “reflection in action”. This methodology is structured in this sequence: convocation of various local actors to participate in participatory diagnoses, identifying problems, opportunities and work challenges, with this material the proposals are jointly prepared. The second phase is constituted by the management of local resources to implement the proposed actions, which in most cases is based on self-management, then the actions are implemented and finally, the process and sense of the experience is evaluated ( Cerda &amp; Rojas, 2004).Public interaction occurs in spaces for dialogue even beyond the local, through seminars, internships, fairs, where the TAC is represented through its local and extra-local volunteers according to the themes contemplated by said meeting spaces. Different actors from civil society, organizations and public authorities participate in these.Another form of public interaction has turned out to be public recognition of the experience, through the awards it has obtained both locally, nationally and internationally. Among the most outstanding is the first regional place in environment by the National Commission of the Environment of Chile; recognition of Good Urban Practices 2002 by the Ministry of Housing and Urbanism Chile, award for Innovation in the environmental area 2002 by the Ford International Foundation, among others.Outcomes and EffectsThe results and effects of the work carried out by the TAC in the territory will be presented from 3 dimensions, first from a quantitative point of view, second from a qualitative point of view, and finally, a concrete case will be presented that shows the replicability of the experience.Quantitative results:There are currently more than 40 organizations associated with the Cordillera network. Among them: 12 public and subsidized schools: common, integrated and special; and 10 foreign universities and institutions. (TAC WEB site). These actors are key in mobilizing resources.Eight meeting and recreation spaces, squares and games have been recovered, transformed and created in Cerro Cordillera (Biblioteca CF + S, 2006).An amphitheater has been built in the heart of one of the Cordillera streams in an old garbage dump, with a capacity for 630 people. (Fundación Habitat Colombia, 2005)Active participation of 200 volunteers and 1,300 children per year approximately.7 Valparaíso universities incorporate the work of the TAC (Fundación Habitat Colombia, 2005) into their curricula through hours of professional practice specifically in pedagogy and special education. 140 young university students have joined the participation in this association.50 murals have been made, building a physical network that shows the identity of the mountain range and Valparaíso (Biblioteca CF + S, 2006).12 community gardens and a greenhouse for plants and reproduction of native trees have been created.3,000 people from various organizations visit the experience annually, proving its replicability. (CF + S Library, 2006)The experience is recognized and awarded regionally, nationally and internationally (TAC WEB Site).Qualitative results:Revaluation of the territory through the history and local identity of the hill (Fundación Habitat Colombia, 2005), generating the appropriation of the territory beyond the tangible, strengthening community ties and the practices of tolerance, solidarity and integration in difference (Observatory Latin American, 2004).Legitimate intervention model in the community, educational, governmental and academic world (CF + S Library, 2006).Continuity and permanence of networking for more than 21 years, promoting community participation in all intervention processes and a proactive civil society.Environmental awareness from the work done in the action of recovering the environment.Development of relationships of trust between public and community organizations (Biblioteca CF + S, 2006).Among the concrete effects that this experience has radiated is the initiative for the comprehensive and participatory restoration of the Working Population, led by young residents of the building who grew up participating in the work carried out by the TAC in the territory.This building is part of the collective history and identity of the hill, it was built in 1870, and corresponds to the first social housing built in Chile. From its beginnings its inhabitants were families of dock workers, whose descendants still live there. (Castillo, 2009). In 2005 it received the bicentennial seal, formalizing its status as a heritage building.This initiative dates back to 1998, when the young residents of the building decided to lead the directive of the working population, forming themselves as a community organization with the aim of starting a work to recover the building promoted from self-management. The first intervention was carried out from their own funds generated by activities promoted by the same community, in a second instance they are coordinated with the Proempleo program (municipal program for the generation of local employment) and receive state funds, where they manage to hire the same neighbors to start the recovery of the building (City of Valparaíso).In 2003, through an initiative of the TAC, a &quot;technical table&quot; was created where neighbors, neighborhood leaders, and public organizations were invited to participate, to address the challenge of recovering the building. This milestone begins a process of formalization of work from the community organization itself, regularizing and cleaning up the property titles that had been carried out for decades, an important task to resolve to access public funds. In this period they are formed as an organizing and technical assistance entity to apply for the Housing Solidarity Fund with the aim of carrying out the formal rehabilitation of the building. A year later they obtain the housing subsidies (Interview with Cristian Amarales).The working population was the protagonist in the development of the project from beginning to end, the board of directors was in charge of choosing the architects and construction companies.The building retains its original design, its modifications are to the interior of it, in terms of restoring the subdivision of apartments for the 34 resident families, where a separate bathroom and kitchen were considered for each of them, unlike its initial design in the which shared a service in the central courtyard, which generated a substantial change in the way of life of the families. The average surface area of apartments is between 55 and 90 m2, which exceeds the minimum standards of social housing that are currently being built in the country.This project received financing from MINVU, and funds generated from the organization&#39;s self-management through the Junta de Andalucía, owners and ValpoMío.Currently, the young people who led this process are organized as a corporation together with a network of organizations to recover the Santa Ana Chapel and later the Cordillera elevator. His vision is to show that the work from the articulation of actors and technical tables is a means to recover our territory, as mentioned by Cristián Amarales, leader and one of the managers of the initiative “... the challenge is to build a new model of public policy, replicable for other experiences ... ”.This way of doing local development is a learning apprehended in the experience lived in the TAC.Analysis and Lessons LearnedRegarding the analysis of the studied experience, we can say that a key strategy to achieve the reconstruction of the social fabric of the territory was the Associativity promoted by the TAC, from the articulation of the existing organizations in the locality, forming the Cordillera network, as platform of action and agents of transformation. Associative links bring together a diversity of views, learning, capacities, efforts and resources to achieve the common objectives proposed.It is recognized that one of the main achievements of the organization is linked to the relevance of the project. The TAC arises from the identification of needs and problems diagnosed by its own inhabitants and has been built at the pace of local processes, the improvement proposals have been made by its own actors, from the construction of spaces for collective participation that they have been strengthening local confidence and capacities.The TAC&#39;s work methodology has established new social practices that have been replicated in other organizations, including Associativity, local self-management, and the way of making participatory decisions and giving meaning to joint action based on “reflecting on the action&quot;.From this perspective, the sustainability of the experience goes beyond the limits of the organization, that is, learning becomes a collective knowledge, which can be applicable to other initiatives of different scales.A central value of the experience studied is its ability to generate spaces and contexts of social integration in the broad sense (diversity of trades, professions, cultures, place of origin), impacting beyond the local scale, becoming a transformative initiative in both people and social practices through the experience of joining and being part with others in a collective project that realizes community dreams ... In the words of the TAC “A space of realities and Dreams” where “Together a better life is built”.Among the weaknesses of the experience, the availability of economic resources is recognized, which are often insufficient and variable for the scope of the intervention (Latin American Observatory, 2004). These problems are overcome thanks to the self-management capacity in which the organization operates, as well as the support received by actors linked to the network.Secondary Sources and External LinksCF + S Library.

It promotes the coordination, the exchange and the sharing of research work that each associated Partner and laboratory undertakes.  The Group thus constitutes the favourite tool for dialog between the community of social scientists (at CNRS, IFSTTAR, IRSTEA, CIRAD), the institutions and companies that have to implement public participation in decision-making processes (the French Ministry of Ecology, Energy, and Sustainable Development, ADEME, the French Environment and Energy Management Agency; CNDP, the National Commission of Public Debate; SNCF Réseau, the National Rail Network; RTE, the French Electricity Transport Network, EDF Inc., the French Electricity Board), and the civil society.  The Group focuses on citizens' contribution, beyond their usual involvement in the institutional political life, to choices about society — sustainable development, social equality, redistribution and solidarity, public engagement with science, freedoms and civil rights, local and metropolitan issues, globalisation, etc. The Group studies their discussion in multiple civic spaces and the public policies implementation of these citizens inputs. Its research work covers all the fields where collective movements meet processes of institutionalization aiming at the inclusion of the citizens in the working-out and the implementation of public action and decision: democracy in social, health and technical issues, opening expertise to public participation, local democracy and community management, public interest and dialogs led at various territorial scales in multiple fields (public utilities, risks, food, school, social policies, environmental health, etc).  The number of laboratories which joined the Group (more than 50) and the success of the first doctoral days on participatory democracy and public participation in decision-making illustrate the vitality of the research field in France, its opening set of themes and scientific disciplines. The GIS Science Committee defined a set of activities which seeks to apprehend the multiplicity of participative experiments arising all trough the world. They aim at giving an account of their emergence in varied political situations, and of their adaptation to differentiated decision-making contexts, to analyze their normative and legal bases, their course and their results, to study their multiple effects, to clarify the issues related to their institutionalization as standard of government:  -a platform for exchange and sharing of research work,  -doctoral Days,  -a conference every 2 years largely open on the actors of the participative democracy,  -scientific workshops,  -collective tools for exchange (pluridisciplinary dictionary, documentation databases,...)  By supporting the confrontation of research work drawing on various normative concepts of democracy, led in a critical distance or a proximity with participatory democracy exercises, concerned with the various approaches that cross social sciences, the GIS intends to be a pluralist benchmark instrument for French research on participatory democracy and public participation in decision-making processes. Its activity aims at facilitating the European and international reception of laboratories work, the taking into account of scientific results in the public action, and the diffusion of knowledge towards a large public.Website  French  http://www.participation-et-democratie.fr  English  http://www.participation-et-democratie.fr/node/133  ",0,0,0,0,0,

Bertrand Pancher is the president of the &#39;association.Organizational Structure and FundingPluralist association, Décider ensemble relies on three colleges of actors: public and semi-public companies, local communities, associations. It also benefits from the support of several French administrations.Specializations and ActivitiesDeciding together starts from the observation that apart from the major institutionalized public debates instructed by the National Commission for Public Debate (local democracy law of 2002), consultation is still very embryonic in France. Public or private decision-makers are often helpless in the face of conflicts of use linked to social, environmental or health issues. They lack the tools and methods on which to rely so that their decisions are more legitimate and therefore better accepted. In response, the association formulates proposals for improving consultation tools and methods and offers an overall reflection on the modes of governance and consultation on social issues, in various fields. Deciding together wishes to: Create a requirement for consultation through collective awareness; Build a culture of decision-making by making elected officials, administrations, project owners, associations and other citizens work together; Disseminate and make accessible to all French and foreign experiences that have proven their worth; Train stakeholders in consultation.Major Projects and EventsDeciding together is developing several areas of work:Organization of scientific seminarsThe “Deciding Together Meetings” provide scientific reflection on the impact of consultation and governance on land use planning, societal issues, industrial development and, more broadly, all decision-making processes. These meetings aim to go beyond the utilitarian and practical aspect to propose an in-depth reflection, a true &quot;thought of concertation&quot;. Each seminar brings together a large panel of speakers, made up of specialists in governance issues and experts in the topic addressed as well as local or national elected representatives.The organization of breakfasts for decision-makers“Consultation breakfasts” focus on a specific theme or question and are based on practical consultation cases to identify proposals for improving decision-making processes (by invitation).Carrying out studiesIn May 2011 Décider ensemble published a study on French practices in project consultation, undertaken in 2009 with the support of ADEME and with the participation of the University of Technology of Compiègne. Carried out with private and public contracting authorities, companies and local communities, the Décider ensemble study brings out practices, methods and consultation tools relating to development projects, industrial projects or public policy projects.  http://www.deciderensemble.com/travaux/experiencesTraining servicesThese trainings are focused on the knowledge of the actors and partners of the consultation as well as the strategies, methods and tools of organization of the public debate.

They include:management process that facilitates interrelationsmanagement process that facilitates interactionsmanagement process that facilitates the functioning of the collectivities they live in.Local, provincial/state, national, international and globalmanagement process that facilitates our societal resources.It also promotes these facts about citizens:Everyone who lives in a collectivity is a citizen.There are different types of citizens; They are:Influencers, from which leaders emerge.Decision makersManagersWorkers and volunteerStay at home parentsOstracizedRemovedTemporaryFinally, the International Organization of Citizens for the Sustainable Management of Societies promotes the fact that all resources are societal, since at one point or another, a citizen must, to create, transform, transport, or recycle or destroy, his new resource, use resources that belong to the collectivity.  There are four types of societal resources:Natural - The ecosystemHuman - The citizens living in the territoryAbstract - Knowledge, culture, laws, management processesTransformed natural - Everything we produce from roads to buildings, from cars to table and from food to books, etc.Volunteers  The organization runs on volunteers. The ideal volunteer citizen will have the following understanding:Understand that society is an organization.Citizens are affected by several societies:local, provincial/state, national, international, as well as byreligious and cultural societiesCitizens are the only owners of these societies, because only citizens can act even if they can act collaboratively in groups such as corporations, unions and governmental and non-governmental organizations.Collectivities can only be good collectivities if the management processes that is implemented by the citizens facilitate both the development of the citizens and the functioning of the collectivities they live in.The volunteer will also have the following skills or be able to develop them:OrganizationalCommunicationCollaborativeUse of Internet based collaborative tools.Understanding of the Learning Organization approach where we look at how each action or each inaction a citizen makes has an impact on another citizen or group of citizens.",0,0,0,0,0,

Just contributors. You decide what work you do, when you do it, and how. Contribution determines your ownership, not job titles or office politics. Problems are solved collaboratively. Quickly. Efficiently. And innovation is through the roof.  This kind of business isn’t just an idea. It exists. It’s a system we developed called The Open Enterprise Model. We use it and love it. And now, through the BetterMeans Platform, our aim is to make this model available to everyone who wants it.  As far as we’re concerned, the reinvention of work couldn’t be happening a moment too soon. The old ways of business are breaking down. We’ve worked in top-down, carrot-and-stick corporations. We’ve had our ideas, enthusiasm, and dignity squished against the walls of middle-management and business-as-usual. It sucks. It’s soul-crushing. Not to mention mind-blowingly inefficient.  Fortunately, new ideas are emerging about how organizations can work. A few smart people in a few smart companies have begun doing things differently, and have been rewarded with amazing results. Google, for example, pays employees 1 day a week to work on their own pet projects. Think this yields better innovations? You better believe it.  After studying the problems and the possibilities... we began to imagine what the ideal workplace might be like. Not just for workers, but for the organization as a whole. (Note: we say “workers” so you’ll understand... but the more you read about us, the more you’ll understand why the word doesn’t quite fit anymore.) We tried to imagine what the ideal organizational model looks like.  We thought about what it would take for people to love their jobs. What would happen if they were empowered, inspired, and eager to help their organization succeed. And guess what? If you figure this piece out, you’ve figured out just about everything else you need to know to make an company thrive. It’s simple: fairly distributed ownership.  Okay. It just sounds simple. There’s actually quite a lot involved in making this possible. Suffice it to say that we did it, and we call this organizational structure the Open Enterprise Model. If you want to read more, here are the details of how an Open Enterprise organization works. Check it out. If you’re an entrepreneur or a business owner, it becomes pretty obvious how powerful this model can be for transforming or launching a company.  Once you’ve understood the Open Enterprise Model, you’ll see there’s a lot to track. Like the Internet, an Open Enterprise business is interconnected but decentralized. That means anyone can interact with anyone to help move the business towards its goals. There must be tools to allow for this kind of collaboration. Software that can track and manage each person’s contributions, their ideas, voting choices, budget controls, payment systems, and ownership credits among other things.  Because of this, BetterMeans has developed the BetterMeans Platform. This is a comprehensive online platform that handles all of the management details of an Open Enterprise, and gives the organization’s workforce the tools required for “deep” collaboration.

436,organization,Colbert Super PAC,https://participedia.net/organization/436,Description not available.,0,2011-12-22,2011-12-22,1081,victor.m.negrete,https://participedia.net/user/1081,1081,victor.m.negrete,https://participedia.net/user/1081,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,governance,,,," Mission and Purpose  The Colbert Super PAC represents an innovative attempt to promote popular participation in a nation which was once celebrated as the example of a robust civil society, [1]  but more recently has experienced a decline in civic engagement. [2]  Specifically, the mission of  Americans for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow  (otherwise known as Colbert Super PAC) is to educate the American public about the inherent danger of institutionalizing the influence of money in a democracy.[1]  As described by Alexis de Tocqueville, most notably, in  Democracy in America (1835-1840).[2]  Putnam, Robert. 1995. “Bowling Alone: America’s Declining Social Capital”  Journal of Democracy  6(1); 65-78.  HistoryOn June 30, 2011 the Federal Election Committee of the United States decided that Stephen Colbert, host of Comedy Central’s  Colbert Report , could establish his own Super PAC to “solicit and accept unlimited contributions from individuals, political committees, corporations, and labor organizations.” [1]  Upon learning that he would be able to move forward with his Super PAC, Colbert commented “this is 100 percent legal and at least 10 percent ethical.”The Colbert Super PAC is the pundit’s response to the 2010  Citizens United  Supreme Court ruling that lifted many restrictions on how corporations and other organized interests could spend money on behalf of almost any cause. Jonathan Alter, former Senior Editor of  Newsweek , described the  Citizens United  ruling as “the most serious threat to American democracy in a generation.”[1]  Carr, David. “ Comic’s PAC Is More than a Gag.” The New York Times. 22 Aug 2011ActivitiesTo date, Colbert Super PAC has produced several political ads for television. The issues addressed in the TV ads range from satirical endorsements of Republican presidential candidates to the NBA lockout. The first of the Super PAC’s ads aired in August 2011 on the eve of the Ames Straw Poll in Iowa. The ad asked Iowans to write in Rick Parry (as opposed to Rick Perry) for the Republican Party’s 2012 presidential nomination. In another ad, a narrator talks about greedy NBA players who want “all the cheese” while “job-creating NBA owners” are doing all they can to save the NBA season. The ads highlight the fact that organizations with vast resources and narrow political agendas can coopt the sphere of public opinion (and thus, participation) by speaking through a “megaphone of cash,” as Stephen Colbert describes it.Also, with the professional legal services of Trevor Potter, former head of the F.E.C and chief counsel to the McCain 2008 campaign, Colbert Super PAC regularly engages in drafting official public comments about F.E.C decisions and opinions. In response to recent activity by Karl Rove’s  America Crossroads Super PAC , Colbert Super PAC issued this statement:  As free as Super PACs are to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money, they are still unfairly shackled by regulation. Notice I used the singular. That's because there is really only one rule that binds Super PACs: that they may not coordinate with candidates' campaigns. But what fun is buying somebody an election if you have no elected official to share the moment with?  America Crossroads' Karl Rove saw through this sham of a charade – or "" shamrade TM"" – and petitioned the F.E.C. to clarify exactly what the law is, so he can carefully obey only the letter of it. We at Colbert Super PAC submitted the attached Public Comment to the Federal Election Commission in a show of non-coordinated, non-consensual support.  Incidentally, you might be interested in knowing that any person, be they corporate or biological, can submit their Public Comment on Karl Rove's Opinion Request (which is AOR 2011-23) by writing to Office of the Commission Secretary's email address (which is  Secretary@FEC.gov ). [1]The Colbert Super PAC takes the tool of political satire to a new level. In order to alert, educate, and mobilize a grassroots movement, the organization operates in the same space and manner of its intended target. This strategy of  mockery as protest  highlights what the group’s members see as the absurdities of American campaign finance law.[1]  from  Newsletter  at ColbertSuperPAC.comParticipation  Within  the GroupWithin the first three months of the Colbert Super PACs existence, the group had already attracted more than 160,000 members (or as Stephen Colbert refers to them, “heroes”). [1]  Members sign up to join the movement by donating money to the Super PAC and voting on what issues matter to them most.Of course, to further illustrate the point that moneyed interests can hijack a representative democracy, Colbert explains that within the Super PAC one dollar equals one vote. That is, the “heroes” who donate more money to the organization have more influence in determining the group’s activities. In this sense, the Colbert Super PAC attempts to be a microcosm of the American political system at large, or at least a microcosm of what members see as the system’s trajectory.Aside from the group’s larger mission, the participatory model of  Americans for A Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow  is itself an interesting study of what twenty-first century civic participation may look like in the United States. That is, the movement consists of a large and disperse community that deploys the tools of information and communication technology to engage in civic activities.[1]  Carr, David. “ Comic’s PAC Is More than a Gag.” The New York Times. 22 Aug 2011THE  SPACE  FOR PARTICIPATIONThe success or failure of a participatory process is often decided by the space in which the process occurs. To be sure, Andrea Cornwall described the idea of a  continuum of spaces  for participation. According to Cornwall, the continuum spans from  closed spaces  on one end to  invited spaces  and then  claimed spaces  for participation at the other end. [1]Colbert Super PAC, however, operates in a space which is better characterized by Cornwall and Coelho’s definition of a “new democratic space.” [2]  That is, the group has inserted itself into a space which is “at the interface between the state and society ... in many respects, [an] intermediary space for negotiation, information and exchange.” [3]  Not entirely a claimed space (after all, the Super PAC operates within the legally pre-approved system); and not exactly an invited space (the group exists to mock the very system which allows it to exist and participate). Instead,  Americans for A Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow  is a claimed space for participation within a framework of invited space.[1]  Cornwall, Andrea. “Making Spaces, Changing Places: Situating Participation in Development.” 2002.[2]  Cornwall, Andrea and Vera Coelho. “Spaces for Change? The Politics of Participation in New Democratic Arenas.” 2004.[3]Ibid.Mockery as ProtestThe Colbert Super PAC’s use of satire as a tool to inform and mobilize opposition to unfair policies is not a new concept. For instance, in China, young bloggers created the fictional  grass mud horse  [1]as a way to protest government censorship and suppression of criticism. [2]  Another example of mockery as protest, also taken from China, is the release of a video game titled  Nail Household vs. Demolition Team  (by Mirage Games) in which Chinese homeowners battle with property developers. [3]Critics of Colbert Super PAC, in particular, and movements based on mockery more broadly, argue that such movements can not succeed and actually threaten to do more harm than good. [4]  Of course, the ability to deem a movement successful or not depends on knowing the goal of the movement in the first place.In the case of Colbert Super PAC, the immediate goal of the movement is to inform, educate, and encourage active civic participation around a serious issue in American politics. In the longer term, the group’s goal could be deduced to be the reversal of policies that have entrenched the influence of money in American politics. Therefore, an evaluation of the group’s success or failure must account for these differences in goals with respect to time.Certainly, the fact that land seizures and evictions still occur in China [5]  would imply that the videogame platform mentioned earlier has been unsuccessful  if  the videogame makers’ goal was to cause immediate change in Chinese development policy. However, if the goal of the gamers was to inform, educate, and mobilize a large audience in opposition to Chinese land development policies, then it may have succeeded (at least, in part). The videogame has reached tens of thousands of people and generated widespread discussion on social media platforms.

It is not a coincidence that the same issues raised by the Colbert Super PAC are echoed by the OCCUPY movements which have sprouted in several US cities in recent months. In fact, Sophia A. McClennen, a Professor at Penn State University, recently wrote an op-ed piece titled “Has the Colbert Nation Occupied Wall Street?” [1]In the article, McClennen writes, “across the globe and from US city to US city, we watch daily as waves of protesters, many of them young, take to the streets. Such images seemed impossible five years ago. Back then the mainstream buzz was that the youth were “stoned slackers” — too narcissistic and tech obsessed to engage in real protest. Where did all of this young activist energy come from? The Colbert Nation ... In the space created by his ironic satire he encourages his audience to question the media, politicians, and the power structure in ways that are not totally dissimilar to OWS ... missing that connection, though, means missing the art of satire since satirical humor mocks those who make a folly of politics and it exposes social absurdities that the public has come to take for granted. Such a form of mockery is the first step in showing the public that they can challenge the status quo ... But aren’t Colbert’s fans just fans? Don’t they just follow him? And aren’t they having too much fun tweeting and editing Wikipedia entries to be serious about activism? The “it getters” of the Colbert Nation know that they can make a public impact, challenge authority, and enjoy themselves at the same time.” [2]Clearly, the Colbert Super PAC is changing the way people engage in civic discourse in the United States. Also, it appears that the group could become a platform for previously disaffected or disillusioned citizens to learn skills and build networks which may spillover in to other forms of participation, as seen in the OCCUPY movements.[1]  McClennen, Sophia A. “ Has the Colbert Nation Occupied Wall Street?” 14 Nov 2011.[2]Ibid.Linkshttp://colbertsuperpac.com/http://colbertsuperpac.com/episodeiv-anewhope/index.phpSources:  Colbert Super PAC logo courtesy of ColbertSuperPAC.com ",1,0,0,0,0,

Please help us verify its content.Mission and Purpose  Governments tend to use ineffective and obsolete citizen engagement methods that no longer stand up to scrutiny. At the same time, advancement in information and communications technology has made it possible to engage in legitimate, scalable democratic practices.PlaceSpeak’s vision is to improve the quality and legitimacy of decision-making and public policy development by modernizing authentication ofdigital identity, protecting privacy by design and ‘making it real’ and actionable with regards to public input. This requires a robust, secure, scalable and privacy enhancing digital identification and authentication ecosystem.  Their approach combines digital identity authentication with privacy by design principles to strengthen legitimacy in online public processes.  Origins and Development  Online citizen engagement is largely anonymous and not tied to place. This has led to the proliferation of trolls, sock puppets, astroturfing and other forms of online dysfunctions designed to skew and distort public opinion. Institutions that seem to have left “the people” out of the governing equation have deeply undermined the public trust.  PlaceSpeak was developed as a way to consult online and prove that it happened. Their location-based smart cities civic engagement platform aims to advance digital democracy by “ making it real ”.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  PlaceSpeak’s mission is to empower people everywhere to provide their verifiable feedback on public consultations by combining the values of a non-profit with the flexibility and innovation of a tech startup. They describe themselves as a new kind of company: a ""social enterprise,"" using the power of business for social good. Like most companies, PlaceSpeak has a business model that allows us to grow rapidly and be financially self-sustaining, providing thousands of people with a free public consultation platform. But unlike many companies, their business is social good.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  By connecting digital identity to residential address, PlaceSpeak provides geo-located feedback to public, private and nonprofit sector organizations, and closes the feedback loop between public consultation, evidence-based decision-making and accountability; engendering trust.  At the same time, PlaceSpeak enables a citizen-centred approach, leveraging the network effect.Using open data, PlaceSpeak delivers address-based notifications to keep residents informed, while providing opportunities to be consulted and involved,as well as encouraging collaboration, all of which ultimately empower citizens.  PlaceSpeak is revolutionizing the online public consultation business. Public consultation is required broadly as part of the democratic process. Governments at all levels directly or indirectly require consultation on a range of issues, most of which are geographically defined. PlaceSpeak taps into that need to consult and adds value by generating verifiable data to support public policy development and local decision-making. PlaceSpeak takes the guesswork out of online consultation.

The Center, which is housed within Merrimack College’s School of Education, brings together faculty, administrators, and community partners to support such academic programs through a variety of initiatives and practices: compiling existing research and documentation to support new and developing programs; sponsoring symposia, conferences, and research opportunities to build a vibrant research base and academic community; and providing a voice and space for dialogue for the value of such academic programs across higher education.  History  In 2010 the Center was founded by Dan Butin. For over the past five years his reasearch has focused on the argument for the institutionalization of community engagement in higher education. His interest in institutionalizing community engagement led to the development of this central research and action hub to develop, coordinate, and support academic programs that are focused on community engagement.  Major projects and eventsCompilationCurrently the Center is compiling existing research and documentation to support new and developing programs. The following resources are housed within the document repository:Strategic Planning Resources  Student Capstone Projects  Course Catalog Resource  Key Texts in Community Engagement  Syllabus ResourceSummer ConferenceThe Center sponsors a yearly summer research institute for departments and academic programs. The upcoming 3rd annual conference will be June 23-24 at Merrimack College.Research OpportunitiesThe Center had a Call for Proposals in September 2011 for research on academic programs in community engagement. This request was to advance the research on academic programs in community engagement.

It begins with community organising and is followed by facilitated, small group dialogue that leads to change. Study circles don’t advocate a particular solution. Instead, they welcome many points of view around a shared concern.  In a Dialogue to Change program, a number of small, diverse group of 5 to 8 participants (a ‘study circle’) meet for 2 hours weekly for 4 weeks (a ’round of study circles’), to address a critical public issue in a democratic and collaborative way. Led by a neutral facilitator, people consider an issue from many points of view while the discussion progresses from personal experiences, to sessions that examine many views on the issue, to a session that considers strategies for action and change.  The round of study circles is followed by a facilitated Action Forum – a community event designed to tie together the work of the individual study circles, and help participants move to individual and collective action. At the forum, groups can share their ideas for action, and participants can join or create action efforts.

The AGORAS operates as a “virtual organization” conducting most of its business through conferences and convened regional and international meetings. Corporate Headquarters are located at the Executive Director’s preferred mailing address, which at this time is 8213 Hwy 85 #901, Riverdale, Georgia 30274 USA. The corporate website is  www.globalagoras.org.By corporate charter, the AGORAS will:Promote the idea of human connectedness and interdependence (the “global village”)  Promote democratic processes for addressing the problems and opportunities associated with global economic and political integration (“globalization”)  Promote the establishment of co-laboratories of democracy (also known as 21st Century Agoras)History  The AGORAS pioneers the adaptation of tools forged from systems science and civic engagement to enable groups to take on ""wicked problems"" of the 21st century and discover both the depth of their situation and the preferred path for their collective futures  The AGORAS is a reincarnation of a lost tribe of the original Club of Rome. Some histories report that the Club of Rome was founded in April 1968 by Aurelio Peccei, an Italian scholar, industrialist and author of The Chasm Ahead, and Alexander King, a Scottish scientist., and operated with an informal ""inner group"" that included four others: Hugo Thiemann (Director of the Battelle Institute in Geneva), Max Kohnstamm Former Secretary General of the ECSC), Jean Saint-Geours (Ministry of Finance in Paris) and Erich Jantsch, author of ""Technological Forecasting.” Aurelio Peccei brought Hasan Özbekhan and Alexander Christakis into the circle in 1970. Shortly thereafter, Alexander Christakis and Hasan Özbekhan discontinued their affiliation due to profound philosophical disagreements about the hierarchical nature of the global planning process which the Club of Rome chose to adopt. Forty years later, Alexander Christakis has returned to launch the AGORAS equipped with tools that enable the bottoms up planning capacities so critically missing from the Club of Rome  [for an update on the Club of Rome see:  http://www.clubofrome.org/eng/about/4/ ].  Specializations and activitiesTo Promote the Idea of Human Connectedness and InterdependenceThe AGORAS has an email practitioner and interested party base of 2000 professionals distributed world wide as of December 2008. The AGORAS communicates to this practitioner base through an electronic newsletter called “ The Agora eBuzz ” and through a corporate website.The AGORAS provides informational seminars, published reports, and training opportunities on structured dialogic design, and provides resource identification assistance for individuals or organizations who are looking for certified SDD practitioners in their geographic region or in their specific field of application. This social networking includes linking practitioners on the basis of SDD project histories.  The AGORAS identifies and engages sources of philanthropic and competitive grant support to convene practitioners into campaigns for social transformation through authentic democratic processes.To Promote Democratic ProcessThe AGORAS maintains an archive of field applications of SDD under the oversight of a corporate research director. Archives will be accepted from any and all individuals who use structured dialogic design for democratic social system services, and collaborative research proposals will be seriously considered from all professional organizations addressing complex challenges which can advance resolution of global economic and political isolation.  The AGORAS maintains an active presence at societies and associations that promote applied democracy through citizen engagement and participation.  The AGORAS will seek to host one international summit or retreat for the global practice of structured dialogic design on a five year cycle, and will derive from these summits a consensus view of the barriers, opportunities, or essential action options required to advance the global democracy.To Promote the Establishment of Co-laboratoriesThe AGORAS maintains and distributes free Microsoft DOS software (with a users guide) to introduce emerging practitioners to tools for constructing influence maps under the structured dialogic design protocol.  The AGORAS holds the service mark (trademark) from the US Patent and Trademark Office for the commercial use of “structured dialogic design” (SDD) in the field of social system design, and the AGORAS certifies participation in official SDD informational events as well as achievement of levels of proficiency of practice through its certified SDD training and apprenticeship programs. SDD training is currently provided by individually recognized SDD experts in classrooms and communities in Cyprus, Mexico, the United States of America, The United Kingdom, India, Japan and Australia. In all locations, SDD differentiates itself as a technical collaborative design practice distinct from traditional facilitation service. Making this distinction, however, can put SDD into a position which may seem to compete with local group facilitation practices. The AGORAS seeks to support local group facilitation practices when these practices find themselves dealing with a social system problem that is genuinely a wicked problem (e.g., the important elements of the problem are misunderstood or poorly understood, rapidly evolving, and interacting with each other in unpredictable ways).Major projects and events  The AGORAS typically works in groups that are recruited to inclusively convene distinct perspectives from across communities of practice and communities of place. These events range in size from 30 to several hundered participants. The full scope of engagement in the 40 year history of this practice fills several recent books.The AGORAS coordinates practitioner teams for groundbreaking applications of structured dialogic design. Some of these innovative applications include:  1. Curriculum design and education system reorganization  2. Online decision making platforms  3. Healthcare system evolution  4. Municipal decision making process enhancement  Funding  AGORAS co-laboratories of democracy are funded by philanthropic sponsors at the community, state, national and intenational level.Publications  Co-Laboratories of Democracy: How People Harness Their Collective Wisdon to Create the Future  By:  Alexander N.

Linda Maduz, at the Center for International and Comparative Studies, at the University of Zurich, argues that, ""direct democracy is a term denoting a variety of processes and institutions, guaranteeing people’s (direct) involvement in political decision-making"" [1].  Seattle's ""Occupy"" movement was begun by a diverse group of Seattleites who joined the nationwide Occupy movement. It started with the Occupy Wall Street resistance movement in New York City's Zuccotti Park. The movement began on September 17, 2011, protesting social and economic inequality [2]. Occupy Seattle argues that the problems that many of us are confronted with, are a result of the unfair distribution of wealth in America, leading to such economic and social inequality. The movement wants to focus elected officials, and the voting public on the majority's desire to “take our government and country back from the big-money interests that currently hold undue sway over the decisions that affect us all.” Participants are coming together in large numbers to effect this change. Their activity centers within the Seattle area, and although they share the consensus of the national movement, their efforts are limited to regional activities [3].  One clear purpose of the Occupy Seattle movement, and their direct democracy public assemblies, is to make the citizens of the greater Seattle area aware of the growing gap between the rich and the poor. G. William Domhoff, Professor of Sociology at the University of California, presented a series of graphs in his article ""Wealth, Income, and Power"" that explains the ""wealth"" breakdown in America. Domhoff's research pointed out that the top 1% only had 42.7% of the wealth, and 19% had 50.3%, leaving the remaining 80% with 7% of the wealth. When considering the research presented by Domhoff, it is evident that there is a growing gap between the rich and the poor. In support of the “Occupy” movement, Domhoff explains, ""that it will be a surprise and then some, because of a recent study (Norton &amp; Ariely, 2010) showing that most Americans (high income or low income, female or male, young or old, Republican or Democrat) have no idea just how concentrated the wealth distribution actually is"" [4].  Origins and Development  Occupy Seattle began with a demonstration at the Federal Building in downtown Seattle on September 26, 2011. The movement is a direct action demonstration activity, that was, and still is, inspired by the “Occupy America” movement. It first began in New York City when an organization known as “Occupy Wall Street” held their first public assembly, protesting against the financial greed and corruption in the Wall Street district of New York City. Not too long after that moment, the Occupy movement spread across America. By October 9, 2011, similar demonstrations were either ongoing or had been held in 70 major cities and over 600 communities across the U.S. [5]. The participants of this newly formed direct democracy are citizens from all across the U.S. who oppose the inequality of wealth, corporate greed, and the corruption of the banking and economic systems in America. They are calling on all Americans to speak out against the 1%, and for the 99% who are disenfranchised and charged with paying back the economic wrongs that the 1% created. Proponents of the Occupy movement cite the “big money interests” as those who are responsible [6]. Since its creation, as the numbers demonstrate, support for the ""Occupy"" movement has grown throughout the Puget Sound region [7].  Occupy Seattle's ""deliberative democracy"" has already begun challenging the Presidential election arena, as with the more recent demonstrations that were held during Rick Santorum's recent visit to Tacoma Washington. After he was faced with a handful of angry protestors who shouted through his entire event, he claimed that the “Occupy” movement was an example of “true intolerance.” This was in response to the tensions that flared when Santorum cited a recent decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals that California's same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional. Later during an interview with Rebecca Kaplan, of CBS News, Santorum stated that what the protesters said, was, “that anybody who disagreed with them were irrational and the only reason they could possibly agree is they were a hater or a bigot,"" inflaming the crowd even more, which in turn led to several arrests [8].  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  In the Occupy Seattle assembly forum, decisions are made through an open deliberative process of a “Direct Democracy” in the form of a public assembly. The members of the Occupy Seattle movement are made up of ordinary citizens of the city of Seattle and the surrounding regions.  Occupy Seattle is unique in the sense that the participant selects the ""Working Group"" that they find most interesting to them. Whether their interest is General Topics, Operations, Communication, Arts and Entertainment, or simply participating in the General Assembly, all they need to do is contact that group using the contact information provided on the Occupy Seattle website.  Joining Occupy Seattle means ""getting together and discussing lots of issues."" From General Assemblies, to Daytime Discussions, Occupy Seattle has events planned for most days of the week. Participants are asked to follow the rules of ""Accountability Principles and Process."" This informs the participant on how to handle conflict, harm, and violations of community agreements within their communities during a public assembly. It also informs the participant how to work together and listen over opposition and banishment, by having respect for the humanity of all individuals involved. Finally, it offers guidance on how to participate with transparency and responsibility within the community, paying close attention to the power dynamics of privilege and oppression [9].  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The ""Occupy"" movement in Seattle, and all across America, aims to address economic and social inequality through the deliberative process of public assembly. Their activities involve protest  demonstrations .Major Projects and Events  On October 1, 2011, Occupy Seattle's  very first official public assembly , the members clearly voiced their frustrations about the roles of government, corporations, and big banks all across American in an equal deliberative forum, in which they shared their own personal ideas and experiences with each other. Their cries for key values, and possible solutions took on an array of different views. In one such view, one woman spoke out contesting her discontent by crying out, ""Voting clearly didn't work, so we're taking to the streets and making it clear that people are upset."" Another participant stated, ""This is not right or left, this is right or wrong."" This example of an equal opportunity to voice their views, was clearly expressed when a megaphone was passed around to the various participants, giving each of them a chance to voice their opinions, and beliefs. One such participant in frustration went on to say, ""I'm ready for real democracy!"" Another cried out, ""I'm tired of the 1% telling us that were supposed to pay for this crisis, the one that they caused, we are the 99% and we want our country back."" This represents a unique way in which the Occupy Seattle movement has fostered equal deliberation. [10]A new agreement was recently passed in Occupy Seattle's General Assembly  on November 16, 2011, stating their policy on unity, solidarity, and debate. First and foremost, the occupy members have agreed that no irrational attacks can be made by any members of the General Assembly. Additionally, they focus actions around their main goal of defending each other and defending the movement within the realms of a healthy debate. Second, no negative actions are to be taken towards occupiers with opposing views that could damage their well being. However, a caveat to this rule may be applied if the occupier has external goals that go against the general unity and aspirations of the movement. Thirdly, no members are allowed to demonstrate any action that appears to be “fascist, racist, sexist, homophobic, white-nationalist populist, ageist, etc.” Finally, if a conclusion or new guidelines are decided upon, the General Assembly is the only governing body of the movement allowed to declare this action as an official Occupy Seattle decision. The General Assembly recognizes that individual occupiers may take their own stance, and although their actions will be supported, the occupiers must understand that the General Assembly holds the power to pass all official Occupy Seattle actions [11].  As recent as November 14th, 2011, The City of Seattle recognized the need of the Occupy Seattle members to peacefully practice their First Amendment rights. Council member Nick Licata supported the  passing of Resolution 31337 , a resolution recognizing and supporting, ""the peaceful and lawful exercise of the First Amendment as a cherished and fundamental right, in an effort to seek solutions for economically distressed Americans at federal and local levels."" The passage of this resolution fully supports the right of the Occupy Seattle members to peacefully protest the widening income gap that is affecting millions of Americans, by having their voices heard, with the hopes of eliminating unjust financial practices [12]. The goal in passing this resolution was to bring attention to the economic concerns of the 99%, in hopes that Congress will recognize it as an important agenda issue, as well as the need to reach a consensus on a solution. Resolution 31337 has also allowed the City of Seattle to foster ideas and solutions by investigating the structural causes currently in place. Continual further actions by the Seattle City Council, includes looking at the City’s current banking practices, their patterns in home foreclosures, as well as current initiatives that foster inequalities [13].  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Occupy Seattle has influenced those challenged during public assemblies. One such example was a year ago, when the leaders of the University of Washington's Foster School of Business booked JP Morgan Chase's CEO Jamie Dimon as the keynote speaker for their business leadership dinner. Protesters marched through the downtown of Seattle to the hotel where Dimon was speaking. JP Morgan Chase has been a recent target of the protestors, because of its acquisition of the former Washington Mutual Corporation, a buyout that put 3,400 Washington Mutual employees out of work, and left much of the former bank's downtown real estate empty. The protestors locked arms, and attempted to barricade the hotel entrances, while chanting and waving signs, stating, ""Prosecute the Real Thieves,” and ""What are profits if you lose your soul?"" Hoping to have some effect on the general public, through this peaceful, and legal public assembly. The Seattle Times and other local reporters talked to the JP Morgan Chase CEO before his speech that night, and he said he understood the protesters' frustration with Wall Street claiming, ""They're right, in general, these big institutions of America let them down,” acknowledging the ""occupiers"" discontent.  In another part of town earlier that day, activists surrounded a Chase bank, prompting clashes between protesters and police, leading to the arrests of five people suspected of trespassing. Police said in their report that at least 10 officers were physically assaulted while removing activists from the scene of the bank protest, with two suffering minor injuries. Additionally, pepper spray was deployed to push back the protesters at the bank.  Occupy's statement on that day was, ""We are hoping, that by our presence at the event where he is a keynote speaker, we will let him and the larger community know that the public is no longer tolerating the misdeeds of the big banks"" [14].  So what has Occupy Seattle accomplished? The strong proponents, as well as the participants themselves, say they have ""heightened awareness, struck a nerve with the American public,"" and that they are educating the people [15]. Just as with the passing of a resolution, giving the ""Occupiers"" the right to peacefully protest, or a large corporation's CEO candidly acknowledging the ""occupiers"" discontent over an issue, progress by the Occupy Seattle organization is subtle, but it is making a difference to the people of Seattle. Their voices are being heard.  Proponents of the “Occupy” movement argue that although the public assembly process, in a direct democracy forum, is healthy and rigorous, they also claim that little is accomplished at just one public assembly. They recognize that it can provide citizens a chance at voicing their opinions, frustrations, and possible solutions, however, they argue that one voice is not enough. Wezel McClellan, from Asheville, N.C., an active ""Occupier,"" offers younger participants advice based on his own experience during the civil rights movement. He tells them not to get discouraged, ""When you look back at what's really worked in history, none of it happened because one rally changed everything.

DARP’s mission is to bring a more empirical and collaborative approach to the study of digital citizen engagement, in context of the important role global digital activism has played in the evolution of non-violent conflicts, democratization, and peace-building efforts around the world.  DARP aims to elevate research about digital media and its effects on international relations by compiling an online database of cases of digital activism. DARP has built an information database and created a way for the public to better study, access, and understand digital activism. By linking scholars and activists to resources like the  Global Digital Activism Data Set  (explained below), DARP is unique in its effort to create “a deliberate dissemination strategy to reach out to policy makers.”  The Digital Activism Research Project is centered on the Global Digital Activism Data Set (GDADS). This data set logs and codes over 1,200 digital activism cases from a set of some 140 countries around the world. Through GDADS, scholars can determine which types of activism have been effective in various countries, communities, and environments around the world. They can then use the knowledge and information gained from the data set to better develop cases of their own using a standardized format.  Supplementary information on digital activism is also available through the DARP website. Articles, books, and films about digital activism can be accessed through links free of charge, so that the larger public and scholars can learn more. DARP is a project of the University of Washington Department of Communication and is funded by the United States Institute of Peace and the MacArthur Foundation.  The project relies on open collaboration, and participants come from diverse backgrounds and areas of knowledge. The researchers and advisors who maintain DARP have aggregated several open access data sets on digital activism and seek to make that information and methodology for studying digital activism widely available.Problems and PurposeThe purpose of the Digital Activism Project is to promote more effective and empirical study of activism through digital forums. Co-founder and Project Manager of DARP,  Mary Joyce , defined the purpose of digital activism as “the use of digital technology in grassroots efforts to achieve social and political change” (Mari).  The primary problem that DARP hopes to address is the lack of coherent resources and methodology available to digital activists and researchers. DARP organizers intend to engage students, work with other research institutions, and take advantage of DARP’s digital platform to improve and expand upon the existing field of study. In this way, DARP seeks to improve the foreign policy expertise of scholars, activists, and policy-makers so they are better able to understand international relations in a digital era. DARP serves as a unifier of online and offline politics, and works to connect with policy-makers more deliberately by providing them access to DARP’s digital tools and database.HistoryThe Digital Research Project was founded by Mary Joyce and Philip Howard and launched in October 2012. Co-founder, and current Project Manager, Mary Joyce, previously founded the Meta-Activism Project in 2010, the precursor to DARP, as well as another grassroots activism website called DigiActive.org in 2007. As an experienced digital activist, Joyce also served as New Media Operations Manager on Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign for president.  Joyce first created the Global Digital Activism Data Set (GDADS) in 2010. Originally, GDADS was intended to bring a “body of strategic knowledge unique to the field of digital activism” to the masses through a digital format. With the creation of DARP, the data set’s goal has expanded to also providing experts and scholars with necessary and effective tools to analyze digital activism.Participant SelectionThe Digital Activism Research Project website allows anyone willing to contribute their knowledge of digital activism to participate. Additionally, the site welcomes contributors who collect cases pertaining to digital activism and those who wish to develop applications for the site. Although the site thrives on the submission of materials from scholars and academics that share a passion for digital activism, everyday operations, upkeep, and data compilation are conducted by the site’s Researchers and Advisors.  The website operates under a Creative Commons Attribution license in order to promote networking. This license allows the data and knowledge that DARP produces to be shared in the most transparent way.Deliberation, Decisions, and Public InteractionThe Digital Activism Research Project makes it easy to explore information about digital activism and its effects. DARP facilitates deliberation through uses of digital technology, such as social networking (e.g Facebook and Twitter), blogs, websites, data sets, and other electronic text.  The Global Digital Activism Data Set allows volunteers to participate and contribute to current cases involving digital activism all over the globe. The contributions are compiled into an open resource that scholars can use to research and analyze the effects of digital activism. Researches can use GDADS to see what cases of digital activism were successful in the past, allowing them to understand policy implications. The website offers free download of the code book, case study list, and data sets. Additionally, DARP contains links to presentations, methodologies, and visual representations of digital activism data.  DARP is committed to providing research that follows a consistent set of standards and definitions. The “Coder Tools” section of the site contains a Codebook of submission guidelines, designed “to create a set of common definitions for the variables which we are using to analyze the case studies in the data set.” Following these guidelines and using the Code Submission Form, researchers can submit a Digital Activism Case, in which digital technology was used in a campaign of social/political change initiated by citizens or used to alter public discussion. Cases should include information about framing effects and mobilizing structures, and should reference trustworthy sources. The Codebook contains six sections to be completed for each Digital Activism Case: (1) Case Meta-Data (2) Time Data (3) Actor Data (4) Geographic Data (5) Application Data (6) Strategy Data. Each section contains a number of variables to be identified for each individual case. Every input for a variable is identified by a different “code,” as defined by the DARP Codebook, and once a case is complete, the data can be quantified according to the codes that have been entered.  Before submitting Digital Activism Cases, coders must view the Coder Training presentation posted to the site. Upon completion, researchers can then contact DARP researchers to be assigned cases to enter into the database.  Additionally, DARP publishes news about the project, resources, and events about digital activism on the website blog. DARP also use Twitter (@ActivelyDigital) to introduce the project and spread information about digital activism by sending out links to articles pertaining to DARP’s projects, blog posts, project updates, and by engaging in discussion about digital media. On their website, DARP also provides links to other projects, blogs, or websites that seek to promote, study, or provide information about digital activism. DARP also provides an extensive bibliography of books, articles, newspapers, blogs, and films pertaining to digital activism and global communications. DARP offers these resources to make comprehensive knowledge on digital activism and its effects available to those interested in the subject. This engages more people in digital activism research and helps DARP attain its goal of creating a collaborative and engaged group of scholars, researchers, and citizens studying digital activism.Influence, Outcome, and EffectsThe Digital Activism Research Project is influencing people throughout the world by creating a comprehensive database, methodology, and collaborative space for people to study digital activism and its effects. DARP allows people to see how digital activism is being used around the world and helps them to analyze the implications and institutional effects on activism on conflict and long-term peace-building efforts. Digital activism is constantly changing and growing, thus by providing a place for collaboration and systemic, empirical research, DARP helps policy makers better understand the effects of digital activism, especially in terms of foreign policy creation. DARP is unique in its collaborative approach. All of the information available on the website is available to anyone, anywhere, and the data sets generated by DARP administrators are a valuable, informative, and educational tool for researchers and policy makers, alike.Analysis and CriticismThere are some areas of DARP that need work. In order for the project to keep up with ever-expanding and growing field of digital activism, the project requires more volunteers and coders. The project requires constant oversight, content production, and analysis by researchers to compile cases into a single, comprehensible data set. The major challenge faced by DARP is putting its database and digital tools into the hands of policymakers. Material needs to be easily accessible and easily utilized by researchers and policymakers.  Outreach is an essential and difficult component of the project, and one of DARP’s potential areas of improvement is the expansion of its language format. DARP is committed to serving as a global digital activism database, and yet many of the cases that are submitted cannot be added because the volunteers are only English speakers. Furthermore, DARP faces potential problems because it is an online-only resource. If the website crashes, is hacked, or otherwise fails to operate, participants and users have no other way of accessing the material.  DARP provides a powerful resource to researchers, policymakers, and the interesting public. By creating a consistent and empirical methodology for analyzing digital activism, DARP offers invaluable access to data and broader implications for future study. DARP provides insight into what technologies work best in certain countries, the ages of people most affected by digital activism, or how technology can help traditional activism to spread the word on a larger scale, among other areas of interest. The potential influence of this project is vast, with academic and practical implications.Secondary Sources""About.""  digital-activism.org.  The Digital Activism Research Project, 2013.

535,organization,Direct Democracy Not Parliamentary Rule,https://participedia.net/organization/535,Description not available.,0,2012-02-29,2022-07-31,1232,Emilyjkim,https://participedia.net/user/1232,421204,"""Nina Sartor""",https://participedia.net/user/421204,en,21 Smith Street ,,Fitzroy,Victoria,3065,Australia,-37.807987,144.982603,,,,,,,,,,,,,,governance,,,,"  Definition‘Direct Democracy Not Parliamentary Rule’ is an organization based in Victoria, Austalia working towards registering as a political party to advocate direct democracy to ultimately change the electoral system. Their overall aim is not to play a role in parliament as any other political party. They want to have their name present on the ballot as a means to generate interest in the ideology of direct democracy. Their current goal is to reach 550 members to be eligible to be placed on the Australian electoral ballot. They currently have a total of 121 members to date. At this time, according to their annual meeting minutes, finding ways of gathering new members to join their cause is their primary concern.Problems and PurposeJust as their slogan states on their website: “Politicians always make the decisions but who knows what we need better than we do?” (rulebythepeople.org). The ultimate purpose is written in their organization’s ‘constitution’ which promotes direct democracy as an alternative to parliamentary rule. As the director of this organization states in their first ever newsletter, “the greatest challenge we face is exposing the farcical nature of parliamentary rule” (News 1). Proving to the rest of the public that a Parliamentary Rule is not going to bring about the kind of changes they seek is their greatest problem. Convincing the voters that the current legislative system is flawed and a need for direct democracy is beneificial for everyone is the biggest problem they will face. The organization hopes to put candidates in Federal elections both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. They “aim to create a society based on direct democratic principles where the people involved in a decision make that decision and appoint delegates to coordinate those decisions at local, regional and national levels” (rulebythepeople.org/constitution). The another issue they are facing is finding new members. Since the start of this organization almost a decade ago the number of stable members continues to fluxuate.History‘Direct Democracy Not Parliamentary Rule’ first assembled on December 3rd 2003 at Ballarat on the 150th anniversary of the Eureka rebellion. This event emphasizes the impact that direct democracies can have in societies (News 1). This group believes direct democracy is the best and true system towards a more healthy and meaningful Australia because the people will have a direct say in where their resources are allocated (rulebythepeople/about).Participant SelectionThe current members of ‘Direct Democracy Not Parliamentary Rule’ reside in Australia who support the cause and ideals of direct democracy over a Parliamentary system. The application to become a member of this organization only require that the prospective member be eligible to enroll for federal elections. Meaning the prospect must be 17 years of age or older, must be an Australian citizen, and must have lived at the present address for at least the last month. Since theis group is aiming at collecting 550 members to be mentioned on the ballot, all are encouraged to participate.Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction  / Specializations and activities‘Direct Democracy Not Parliamentary Rule’ holds annual general meetings at the mentioned rented space [supplied at the sidebar]. These annual general meetings [AGM] are performed in a formal manner; the National Convenor opens the meeting, the secretary keeps track of the minutes and later posts the minutes of the meeting on their organization website. There are two other meetings held in addition to the AGM, these meetings are held every four months where they discuss nominations for Nation Convenor, Registered Officer, Treasurer, and Secretary. The nominee must provide nominee details, acceptance of nomination, and signatures from three other members of the organization. Nominations are then added into the following newsletter. The meetings consists of decisions about a need for more members. They best way to achieve that goal is if each existing member sign up one new member within the following year. The meeting also establishes the location, time, and date of the next meeting. Then they briefly conclude with a summary of the meeting, and address the need for financial support. All meetings are open to the public (AGM-Minutes).Influence, Outcome, and Effects / major projects and eventsSince this group consists of 121 members and has not had the chance to be a part of the official ballot they are still on the path of reaching their goals to change the electoral system entirely. As an organization they have attempted spreading their message by means other than the internet and newsletters. They attend events such as public discussions at the local community center and referendum conferences to help share their cause.FundingThis organization requires each member to supply two $.55 stamps annually to help pay for the cost of sending out newsletters for five years membership. Also written in their constitution those who are chosen to represent this group must make decisions that reflect the majority opinion. They pledge under oath that if they do not fulfill their direct democracy duties as representatives in parliamentary they will give up their seat and give back any wages they received as Senator or Representative.Analysis and CriticismThis was an overview of a still rather unknown direct democracy organization in Australia, the purpose for this criticism is to help spread the word about this growing organization. This was an introduction to a group I stumbled upon and found interesting. I support their efforts indubitably. The concept of a direct democracy is completely logical but in terms of making this organization more noticeable is the only critique I have to offer. For a political party that has existed for nine years, 121 members is reasonable. If this group were to publish their ideas and more indepth goals and plans on the web it would make for a more legitamate proposal. This group to should attend this open conferences and discussions and document them and put them online for the world to see.Secondary Sourceshttp://www.rulebythepeople.org/media/constitution.phphttp://www.rulebythepeople.org/index.php?news=0External Linkshttp://www.rulebythepeople.org/index.php?a=aboutushttp://www.politicsandculture.org/2010/08/10/the-eureka-rebellion-of-1854-by-eric-petersen-2/http://www.rulebythepeople.org/media/DDNPR%20ARTICLE%20-%20PARLIAMENTARY...Notes.News 1 -  http://www.rulebythepeople.org/index.php?news=1AGM- Minutes -  http://www.rulebythepeople.org/media/AGM-Minutes-2009.pdf",1,0,0,0,0,

A variety of internet sub-cultures gave birth to the dynamic entity known as Anonymous. The term “anonymous” originally referred to any internet user in general and their anonymous online identity and the term remains to do so. Anonymous, with a capital ‘a,’ arose from an internet  meme  in 2003. It represented the mass of internet users whose activity was carried out anonymously via the web as a collective whole. Eventually, actions orchestrated across a variety of message boards and chat rooms perpetrated by members of these online communities legitimized the idea of Anonymous amongst the internet sub-cultures that Anonymous' members populated as well as the general public. The  Guy Fawkes face mask  has become a semi-official symbol of the group.  Problems and Purpose  Anonymous is committed to defending free-speech, opposing censorship, promoting transparency and exposing corruption. Recent acts of Anonymous include; Anonymous challenging the  IFPI , the  RIAA  and the  MPAA  with  DDoS  attacks in the wake of the Pirate Bay verdict and the shutdown of the filesharing site Megaupload. Anonymous taking action to protest  SOPA  and  PIPA . Anonymous is currently involved in aiding Wikileaks with their operation.  History  Anonymous’ existence as an internet meme started in 2003 across message boards and websites like  4chan  and eBaum’s World. On these sites, users posted on message boards and image boards anonymously which led to the creation of the meme. The growth of the subcultures on these sites resulted in a proliferation of internet lingo, inside jokes, and the use of “underground” methods of online communication such as  IRC . Eventually the users gained a communal awareness that would come to be known as Anonymous. Anonymous lay dormant for several years, committing internet pranks and acts of vigilantism. It wasn’t until 2008 that the group gained mass media attention when it declared “war” on the Church of Scientology. Anonymous initiated Project Chanology which involved DDoS attacks on Scientology websites, prank calls, and protests in cities around the world. Project Chanology was Anonymous’ first dedicated large-scale operation. From here on, Anonymous would continue to become increasingly involved with hacktivist activities.  Since Project Chanology, Anonymous has remained political. After the rigged presidential election in Iran of June 2009, riots broke out. Anonymous aided Iranian hackers in keeping information flowing freely in and out of the country after the Iranian government attempted to censor news about the protests on the internet. Later in 2010, Anonymous hacked Sony’s PSN network. In December of 2010, Anonymous allied with Wikileaks and struck at websites belonging to Amazon, Paypal, Mastercard, Visa, and the Swiss bank PostFinance with DDoS attacks. During the Arab Spring in 2011, Anonymous backed the revolutionary activities by hacking various government webisites and putting them offline. On February 5, 2011, Aaron Barr, the CEO of the security firm HBGary Federal announced that his firm had infiltrated Anonymous. In response Anonymous hacked the HBGary Federal website, took control of the company’s email, erased files and took down the company’s phone system.  As Anonymous grew, sub groups like LulzSec and PLF developed and the number of operations that Anonymous executed multiplied rapidly. Anonymous conducted twenty-three different operations over the course of 2011. These include supporting the  Occupy movement  and Operation Darknet, where Anonymous wiped out forty child pornography sites. So far in 2012, Anonymous has conducted an unconfirmed nine to ten operations.  Participation“ Anonymous is the first Internetbased superconsciousness. Anonymous is a group, in the sense that a flock of birds is a group. How do you know they’re a group? Because they’re travelling in the same direction. At any given moment, more birds could join, leave, peel off in another direction entirely.” –Chris Landers. Baltimore City Paper, April 2, 2008.  Anyone can join Anonymous. The most simple way is to go online and download the  Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC)  software. Any computer with the LOIC loaded on it is made part of the botnet that Anonymous uses to conduct its DDoS attacks upon selected websites. The FBI and other law enforcement agencies consider the LOIC and other software that facilitates DDoS attacks illegal. Other ways to become more involved in Anonymous include visiting Anonymous related websites, following Anonymous Twitter profiles, participating in the real life protests related to Anonymous' causes and downloading an IRC client to become more deeply involved with Anonymous.  Deliberation and Decisions  Anonymous has no single leader. Members express personal opinions on issues they wish to pursue and the members of Anonymous decide whether of not it is a cause they themselves wish to undertake. Finding the right IRC channel to truly become part of Anonymous’ deliberative process can be a complicated task for the everyday internet user. Learning one’s way around IRC is only one of the challenges. Above normal knowledge of operating computers could be necessary and familiarity with the vast lexicon of the internet is a must have in order to reach areas where Anonymous' deliberation takes place. Preexisting members are wary of newcomers due to the sensitivity and risk involved with the group’s activities. Some members of Anonymous have greater decision making power than others, any sort of power structure within the group can only be speculated upon, but there is a distinction between members who are merely apart of the Anonymous and those who decide which targets are ultimately chosen. Not every decision Anonymous makes is unanimous. Members of Anonymous do not have to participate in an operation should the objective of the operation not align with their ideas.  Influence and Effects  Anonymous has brought about the first major unified internet movement to have effects in the real world. Anonymous has created a form of protest and civil-disobedience via the internet that has never been seen before, being able to lend tangible support to many different causes throughout the world. This is important because previously online activism could only be executed by highly skilled hackers with singular agendas. Anonymous has allowed the everyday web user to get involved with the only requirement being an internet connection. It has changed the dynamic of the overall online community as a whole because it has bridged part of the gap between the mainstream internet user and the underground internet user.Analysis and Criticism  Arrests have occurred and continue to occur as a result of being directly involved with Anonymous and utilizing the LOIC software to assist in the group’s DDoS attacks. Research has shown that people who install the LOIC software on their computers are not actually remaining, in fact, anonymous. Internet users who employ the LOIC and don’t go through an anonymization network or use IP-spoofing can be easily traced. A question has been raised whether the masses are part of the struggle or just pawns offering their computers to those hackers that know how to better protect themselves online. Questions have also been raised about whether or not Anonymous’ actions truly help or do anything at all. When SOPA was being considered by the House of Representatives and PIPA in the Senate, members of the internet community said that Anonymous’ attacks on the FBI and other websites were just hurting the anti-SOPA/PIPA cause. Critics called Anonymous’ actions during the Arab Spring “armchair activism,” and wondered if they actually contributed the causes in any tangible way.  Secondary Sources  Mansfield-Devine, Steve.

These local programs protect natural resources for future generations, provide public access to public waters and shores, and plan for water-dependent uses. They are created in partnership with the local community and the Department of Ecology, and must comply with the state Shoreline Management Act and Shoreline Master Program Guidelines. As mandated, over 260 local programs must be updated by 2014, focusing on providing a unique opportunity to create a positive future for Washington’s shorelines.  SMP updates strive to meet goals and expectations to protect and conserve shoreline natural resources. This includes the protection of critical areas and habitats, while still accommodating reasonable and appropriate uses. The goal of these two objectives is to succeed with a minimum of no net loss to shoreline ecological functions and processes. (WAC 173-26-201(2)(c))History and Early ChallengesIn 1971, the people of the State of Washington voted for the Shoreline Management Act (SMA). This ultimately created three primary purposes: 1) To protect ecological functions; 2) To accommodate appropriate uses; and 3) To maintain public access. The Shoreline Master Program (SMP) implements the policies of the SMA at the local level by regulating use and development along shorelines. The Department of Ecology is responsible for ensuring that the local SMP is consistent with the intent of the SMA, and has final approval authority.  In 2003, the Washington State Legislature took a significant step to revitalize the 32-year-old SMA and increase the emphasis on environmental protection. The Legislature, stimulated by agreement from a wide range of environmental, business, and government interests, set out on an ambitious task. This new framework required 264 towns, cities, and counties across the state to update their Shoreline Master Programs by 2014.  In order to implement these legislative mandates, the Department of Ecology adopted a new series of regulations known as the Shoreline Guidelines in 2004. These Guidelines were designed as state standards which local governments must follow in drafting their shoreline master programs. The Guidelines translate the broad policies of the Shoreline Management Act (RCW 90.58.020) into standards for regulation of shoreline uses. The state legislature directed Ecology in 1995 to update the guidelines, which had not been revised since 1972 and did not account for advancements in science and shoreline management practices nor the recent passage of Washington’s Growth Management Act. Ecology proposed a first draft in 1999 and adopted a substantially revised draft in 2000 that was eventually challenged in court.  Then-Governor Gary Locke and former Attorney General Christine Gregoire co-sponsored a year-long mediation effort in 2002 that culminated in a third draft, which was issued for public comment in July 2002. That proposal had the endorsement of all of the parties to the lawsuit, including the Association of Washington Business (representing a coalition of business organizations, cities and counties), the Washington Aggregates &amp; Concrete Association, the Washington Environmental Council (WEC) and other environmental organizations – all of whom were parties to the lawsuit. The final version was adopted December 17, 2003 and became effective January 17, 2004.  Ecology made additional amendments to the Guidelines between 2004 and 2011 in response to changes in state statute. In 2011, Ecology amended the Guidelines in response to a 2007 statute (RCW 43.21A.681) that directed them to “adopt, by rule” guidance on geoduck aquaculture with advice from a Shellfish Aquaculture Regulatory Committee (SARC). Ecology adopted amendments to the Guidelines in February 2011 that include new provisions for commercial geoduck aquaculture. Ecology also completed additional housekeeping amendments to chapters 173-18, 20, 22, 26 and 27 WAC at that time.Creation and Participant SelectionAs part of a comprehensive update to the SMP of Kitsap County, a task-force of citizens with shoreline-related interests were to be selected to work with County staff to develop goals, policies, and to assist in recommending regulations on SMP issues that need to be updated.  In order to qualify for selection, the applicant must be a resident of Kitsap County and willing to commit the time necessary to complete the work of the task force; must be able to work respectfully in a group setting and contribute constructively to the dialog; must be open to a multitude of issues relating to the SMP Update; and and be willing to take into consideration the various needs of the community. No technical skills are required but certainly encouraged, and meetings may require up to three hours of sitting with breaks as appropriate.  The Kitsap County Board of Commissioners authorized the development of an SMP task-force and was funded to assist until June 30, 2011 or longer should sufficient resources be available. On March 8, 2010, the task-force plan was adopted and 20 citizens were selected by the Kitsap County Board of Commissioners, signed by then Chairperson Josh Brown and Commissioner Steve Bauer.  These members would be responsible for reviewing Shoreline Master Program procedures and guidelines; read and discuss information provided regarding shoreline uses and functions; participate and actively engage in meetings; and make recommendations based on information in the group discussions.  Federal, State and Local Natural Resource agencies and other stakeholders would be asked to share their expertise with the task force as needed. Once selected, the members would be obligated to participate in bimonthly meetings to discuss the community’s vision for shoreline usage; and make recommendations regarding policies and regulations for the SMP Update. Task force members are expected to learn about and gain an understanding of shoreline issues in order to make sound recommendations.  Those 20 citizens selected were as follows:James Aho Bob Benze Carrilu Thompson Sunny WheelerLinda Atkisson Ken Parker Susan Cruver Jessica CoyleDave Nelson Mike Ingham Michelle Filley Tom NevinsJennifer Forbes Zachary Halls Dan Fallstrom Art CastleMichael Maddox Don Seavy Rebecca Mars Mike EllisThese individual volunteers were selected due to the broad diversity of interest groups that they represent, ranging from local home-owners, teachers, students, attorneys, realtors, community activists, and organizations such as the Kitsap Alliance of Property Owners (KAPO).Vision Statement of the SMP Task ForceComply with legislative mandates including requirements for no net loss of shoreline ecological functions and values  Protect private individual property rights consistent with the public interest  Create a shoreline stewardship program that fosters reasonable and appropriate shoreline uses while protecting valuable and fragile natural resources  Engage a wide variety of stakeholders, citizens and interests in developing goals and policies.  Integrate and support County development plans, policies, and regulations  Ensure predictability, accountability, and efficiency during shoreline development review and decision making  Have a strong scientific basisFundingSince the creation of the Shoreline Guidelines in 2004, the Department of Ecology has worked with local governments to fund and support comprehensive SMP updates as mandated by the State Legislature, including the SMP update within Kitsap County. According to public records on behalf of the state, and the Department of Ecology, up to $650,000 has been allocated to Kitsap County in order to facilitate the SMP update; $520,000 for the first two fiscal years (7/1/09 – 6/30/11) and the additional amount of $130,000 for the third fiscal year (7/1/11 – 6/30/12).PublicationsEcology.

Participants gather and analyze data, engage in group discussions, and develop social science course material. Scholars also create projects and publish their findings. Major ProjectsPuget SoundOff Created in 2008,  Puget SoundOff  is a website for Seattle-area youth [15] . This website serves as a host for public discussion and deliberation. This website sees approximately 10,000 visitors between the ages of 13 to 21 per month  [16] . This forum is a product of collaborating between the CCCE,  The Seattle YMCA , and  the City of Seattle . Site visitors can post photos, create group discussions, and browse current job openings among other features Puget SoundOff has to offer  [17] . In 2009, Puget SoundOff won  The Public Technology Institute  award for “best web and government services” [18] . The Citizen Roundtable on Politics and Democracy The CCCE holds citizen roundtable discussions and deliberations. Community members gather to listen to presentations given by University of Washington professors. Members then discuss issues brought forth in the presentations. Discussion issues include “the problem of press dependence on the government, the impact of fundamentalist religion on contemporary politics, the privatization of public space, the transformation of US foreign policy, privacy and the internet,  the Motherhood Manifesto , and the US economy and its effects upon society” [19]The first citizen roundtable discussion was about the 2004 presidential campaign [20] . Since then, the CCCE schedules 5 roundtable discussion events per year [21] . The CCCE also hosts a  citizen roundtable blog  for community members to engage in further discussion and expression. The Global Citizen Project  The Global Citizen Project  serves as a source for people to “share ideas, inspiration and to create knowledge to help revitalize democratic politics” [22] . Through this site, the CCCE shares resources, links, and research showcasing “emerging activities of global citizens who are changing the nature of politics both nationally and internationally” [23] . This project encourages communication on a global scale by contributing to governmental deliberations.The Center for Communication and Civic Engagement  has a list of all current and past projects.  Influence, Outcome, and Effects  The CCCE has received local, national, and global attention for its research on changing communication mediums. As a result, the CCCE continues to hire qualified staff and students to contribute to its deliberative efforts [24] .  In 2009, the state of Illinois named the CCCE as a potential model for its  Institute for Policy and Civic Engagement at the University of Illinois, Chicago  [25] . Directors for the Institute for Policy and Civic Engagement met with Lance Bennett and other CCCE faculty to discuss better ways to foster deliberative communication and advocacy [26] .  According to a two-month survey in 2009, Puget SoundOff is one of the CCCE’s most viewed projects [27] .  Google Analytics , an online web tracking system, projects on average, Puget Soundoff visitors view 6.23 pages per visit [28] . Los Angeles and New York City are two of the top ten cities for Puget SoundOff visitors [29] . Puget SoundOff also sees visitors from over 108 countries and 6 continents [30] .  In 2010, the  National Science Foundation  rewarded CCCE director, Lance Bennett with a $730,000 grant [31] . The grant is for improving deliberation through Internet-based forums [32] .  Analysis and Criticism  The University of Washington's Center for Communication and Civic Engagement helps cultivate discussion on local, national, and global scales. Members of the CCCE also engage in deliberation by researching new communication technologies, analyzing data, and tracking political issues. Developing projects, such as The Citizen Roundtable on Politics and Democracy, also encourages citizens to actively participate in deliberative discussions. Whether it is through face-to-face communicating or online blog posts, the CCCE provides opportunities for people to voice their views by interacting with other scholars or citizens.Secondary Sources[1]The Center for Communication and Civic Engagement: Who We Are[2]The Center for Communication and Civic Engagement: Who We Are[3]The Center for Communication and Civic Engagement: Intellectual Agenda[4]The Center for Communication and Civic Engagement: Our Mission[5]The Center for Communication and Civic Engagement: Our Mission[6]The Center for Communication and Civic Engagement[7]Undergraduate Research[8]CCCE Directors[9]CCCE Staff[10]CCCE Faculty Affiliates[11]CCCE Student Advisors[12]CCCE Emeritus Student Advisors[13]CCCE Center Fellows[14]Undergraduate Research Projects[15]CCCE Puget SoundOff Project[16]The University of Washington’s Center for Communication and Civic Engagement—An Example for the Knight Commission[17]The University of Washington’s Center for Communication and Civic Engagement—An Example for the Knight Commission[18]CCCE Puget SoundOff Project[19]The Citizen Roundtable on Politics and Democracy[20]The Citizen Roundtable on Politics and Democracy[21]The Citizen Roundtable on Politics and Democracy[22]Global Citizen Project[23]Global Citizen Project[24]CCCE Newsletter[25]CCCE Newsletter[26]CCCE Newsletter[27]CCCE Newsletter[28]CCCE Newsletter[29]CCCE Newsletter[30]CCCE Newsletter[31]Department of Communication News[32]Department of Communication NewsExternal Linkshttp://depts.washington.edu/ccce/civiceducation/roundtable.htmlhttp://citizenroundtable.wordpress.com/http://www.uic.edu/cuppa/ipce/http://ccce.com.washington.edu/http://www.engagedyouth.org/http://mediaresearchhub.ssrc.org/university-of-washington-2/institution_...http://www.washington.edu/uaa/mge/apply/research/http://depts.washington.edu/gcp/http://pugetsoundoff.org/http://www.ci.seattle.wa.us/tech/https://citp.princeton.edu/http://ccce.com.washington.edu/projects/pitpi.htmlhttp://ccce.com.washington.edu/projects/nsfgrant.htmlhttp://ccce.com.washington.edu/news/assets/2009_newsletter.pdfhttp://ccce.com.washington.edu/news/news_and_events.htmlNotesIf you are a University of Washington student or faculty member and would like to participate in the Center for Communication and Civic Engagement, please contact  Lance Bennett .

Through the teaching of non-violent techniques and strategies, the Backbone Campaign looks first to give individuals the tools to have an effective political voice, and second to implement those skills in a manner that generates a dialogue between political leaders and those that they represent. Through the creation and utilization of “innovative messaging and political theater ...[as well as] creative tactics such as spectacle imagery and other festival arts, giant banners and puppets, flash mobs, music and other theatrical forms of non-violent direct action,” the Backbone Campaign believes that they can restore a political voice to the American public. “The Backbone Campaign awakens and inspires Americans to build a progressive movement, reclaim our government, and secure a future worthy of our children.” – Mission Statement viaMeet the Backbone CampaignHistory The Backbone Campaign was conceptualized and set into motion by a group of artists on Vashon Island—near Seattle, Washington—in 2002. Some of the initial goals of the project were to create signs to show politically motivated messages at freeway overpasses, and—on a more national level—market their creative skills and the concept of a Backbone Campaign to progressive movements in the Washington DC area. However, after being met with less than satisfactory interest, the artists switched their focus to their own community, as well as other similarly progressive, grassroots organizations around the country. In the Campaign’s inaugural year, they gave out a series of “Backbone” awards— featuring a golden spinal column —to the likes of Jim McDermott, Howard Dean, and Cynthia McKinney for their commitment to upholding progressive values in the face of great adversity. By 2004, the Backbone Campaign had created their own progressive platform, which they utilized to, “introduce progressive values and language into local and state party platforms through the 2004 caucus process and the 2004 DNC platform committee hearings” ( Meet the Backbone Campaign ). In 2004, the artists of the Backbone Campaign also created a  70-foot-long backbone puppet , with a progressive platform item on each vertebra, which was used at demonstrations along the West Coast, eventually making it to the Democratic National Convention in Boston. Along with the spine, Backbone artists also created the “Bush and Co. Chain Gang”—giant puppet heads made in the likenesses of  Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld, and George W. Bush, wearing prison uniforms and shackles . In their effort to continue to promote accountability, the Campaign also gave out a number of “Spine Awards” to politicians and activists who had done work on a community scale. They also created their “‘Thank and Spank’ citizen lobbying tools” that presented representatives with “Spine Cards” when they stood up for progressive values or policies, or “Spineless Citations” when they voted against progressive principles. In the eight years since, the Backbone Campaign has taken on many nationally relevant projects, and allied itself with similar organizations such as Move To Amend, the Puffin Foundation West, MoveOn.org, and Occupy Wall Street, in order to further achieve their goals.  Participant Selection  Supporters and participants involved in the Campaign’s work are quite varied, based on Backbone’s goal to provide training, strategies, and “creative tactics” to any who wish to communicate their discontent with politicians who refuse to stand firmly for the progressive ideals they’ve committed to, or with companies that aim to exploit citizens or the environment. Also, through their  Localize This!  Action Camp, the Backbone Campaign has made an effort to reach out especially to the Pacific Northwest’s outdoor-oriented progressives, with a series of climbing and kayaking-based actions.Major projects and eventsLocalize This!  Action CampThe  Localize This!  Action Camp is held every summer at a camping space on Vashon Island. For a week, participants are taught, “Grand Strategy &amp; Creative Tactics; Community Supported Organizer Skills; Action Planning &amp; Earned Media; Anti-Foreclosure, Eviction Protection &amp; Buy-back; Organizing from a Human Rights Framework; [Non-Violent Direct Action], Tripod, Blockades Training; Rappelling, Kayak Safety &amp; Water-Based Tactics; Giant Puppet &amp; Banner Building; Economic Democracy Strategies; Drumming, Flash Mobs and More.” The week generally culminates with an organized action relating to a current issue—2010’s action was a critique of the Supreme Court’s ruling that corporations could limitlessly fund political candidates, and featured a song and dance inside a Target, titled,  “Target Ain’t People,”  that generated over a million and a half views on YouTube.Shared Sacrifice My AssIn August of 2011, the Backbone Campaign helped to organize an action in Seward Park, on the shores of Lake Washington, aimed at challenging Washington’s most affluent individuals and corporations to “share [in] the economic sacrifices [of] working families” (“Shared Sacrifice”). The action involved songs and dancing, and giant signs held airborne by balloons—one of which showed a  partially covered behind, and the words, “SharedSacrificeMyAss.org.”  The sign was positioned across the lake from the Mercer Island estate of billionaire, Paul Allen, and targeted him and more of Washington’s wealthiest who were fighting the implementation of a new state income tax. For the project, the Backbone Campaign partnered with the Washington Community Action Network with the goal of showing the public that budget cuts for education and healthcare came as a result of middle and working class families having to take on too great of an economic burden. The action attracted extensive attention from local news sources, as well as from other national, progressive, grassroots organizations.For the People Rally &amp; SummitIn January, 2012, the Backbone Campaign teamed up with Occupy Wall Street for Occupy the Courts, in Washington DC, as a second annual protest of the Supreme Court’s decision granting corporate personhood. Although much smaller, the event’s predecessor stirred up a great deal of media attention in local news and led to articles in several progressive magazines, creating momentum for the 2012 action. According to Bill Moyer, Backbone Campaign’s Executive Director, the 2012 action included, “street theater, giant banners, and even light projections on the Supreme Court and the [headquarters] of the US Chamber of Commerce” (“Creativity &amp; Bold Action”). As a result of the publicity gained through this year’s action, the Backbone Campaign received interviews from Seattle’s National Public Radio affiliate and PunkPatriot.com.Action-In-A-Box: Corporate Personhood Action ToolkitIn late 2011, the Backbone Campaign collaborated with MoveToAmend.org to bring media attention to the debate of corporate personhood. The goal of the action was to encourage the action of other grassroots efforts and motivated individuals by making participation easy. To achieve this, the organization teamed up with a number of independent, supportive artists and organizations to create “Action-in-a-Box” toolkits. The toolkits included instructions and materials for a number of action-oriented projects, as well as information about the history of the fight against corporate personhood in America (“Corporate Personhood”).The 99% Choir Goes Christmas CarolingJust before Christmas in 2011, the Backbone Campaign partnered with the Other 98%, the Seattle Labor Chorus, and the Washington Community Action Network to bring a Christmas-themed action to the Bank of America Tower in Seattle, Washington, along with several other Bank of America and Wells Fargo locations. The carolers sung songs to bank-goers and personnel, like,  “We’ll Foreclose, We’ll Foreclose, We’ll Foreclose” and “Deck the Jails with Wall Street Bankers,”  and left fake foreclosure notices from the 99% on the walls, citing, “Bribery, Fraud, [and] Extortion” (Kouril).The Fight for Puget SoundIn July of 2008, after months of fighting, Glacier Northwest received the right to begin building a 400-foot pier, over state-owned aquatic lands, which would allow them access to the 192-acre gravel mine they had purchased on Maury Island (Brown). The Backbone Campaign and others in the opposition contended that the pier’s construction would have too many negative environmental impacts; but, after an investigation by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Glacier Northwest was allowed to continue. In the following months, the legal battles continued, but legislation to protect Maury Island continued to fail on the State level. During this time, the Backbone Campaign took an active role protesting, in both the community and in the field, against Glacier’s advancements. A group of kayakers—dubbed “The Mosquito Fleet,” and created to strategically hinder the progress of Glacier’s water construction equipment—made several appearances, earning local media attention. Through the start of 2009, actions led by the Backbone Campaign and the Mosquito Fleet to slow Glacier’s progress continued, but going into the following spring, newly elected Governor Christine Gregoire remained unresponsive to Backbone’s pleas for assistance. At the start of the summer, the Backbone Campaign headed a petition demanding Gregoire’s support, and warning of the intentions of that summer’s Action Camp. In July of 2009, with no compromise in sight, the Backbone Campaign teamed up with the Ruckus Society for another non-violent attack on Glacier’s mining and construction operation—during which, the Mosquito Fleet again did its job, hindering Glacier’s abilities and generating media attention. Going into August, the Backbone Campaign and its collaborators had organized a rapid response team available 24/7 for actions against any incoming Glacier watercrafts. At the End of August, Backbone’s efforts paid off, as U.S. District Justice Ricardo Martinez ruled against the Army Corps of Engineers’ original environmental findings. Over the next year, the battle for Maury Island continued in the courts, but after the King Country elections in November of 2010, CalPortland (Glacier’s parent company) announced its agreement with the Cascade Land Conservancy and King County to sell the land to the public. The result of the deal was the establishment of a 250-acre park—the largest protected shoreline in the Puget Sound—and a colossal victory for the Backbone Campaign and its supporters. (“Timeline to Victory”)BP/Arco BoycottIn the wake of the 2010 BP oil spill, the Backbone Campaign planned an action to boycott BP/Arco Stations in the Seattle Area, and to place a banner on the Interstate-5 Yesler overpass. The Campaign’s protest caught the attention of local news as well as the FOX Business channel.  Executive Director Bill Moyer went on FOX Business  to defend the boycott, and speak out against BP’s political sponsorships and American dependence on foreign and domestic oil. (“Boycott of BP-ARCO”)  Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction  The Backbone campaign is a collaboration between many individuals who donate their time and effort to promote the organization’s success.

The project is carried out at the Social and Health Management Department at the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Vaasa.BackgroundDeliberative democracy can be seen as especially beneficial when the contemporary problems of health care are tackled. One distinct problem is the complex and inevitable issue of ‘limited resources, unlimited demand’. The existence of this gap between the demands and available resources cannot be denied or avoided. At the same time as the resource problems are getting worse, people’s expectations for health care grow. At the municipal level, the decisions are made in the frame of representative democracy, i.e. based on the views of elected representatives and technocratic experts. However, as the allocation of scarce resources demands more and more compromises and sacrifices, it becomes meaningful to ask whether the public could be given a stronger role on tackling these highly wicked health care issues.  For example, the USA and UK have been implementing different forms of deliberative democracy. In Finland, so far these are almost non-existent. Few have been implement, but none of these have been targeted on health care issues. The objective of this research project is to gain scientific evidence of how and if the practices of deliberative democracy could be applied in the context of Finnish health care. The main research questions are as follows;  1) Can the applications of deliberative democracy serve as a way of expressing the citizen’s voice in Finnish health care? We also have to ask; 2) what are the multidimensional elements of deliberative democracy, and how are they utilized in the health care of selected countries?  These can be divided into three interlinked research tasks (RT): to analyze and understand the multidimensional elements of deliberative democracy (RT1); to analyze the utilization of deliberative democracy models in the health care of selected countries (RT2); and to create and test a deliberative democracy model applicable to Finnish health care on the bases of theoretical framework and empirical study (RT3). The additional theoretical framework for the study consists of complexity theory, the concept of wicked problems and the idea of collective intelligence.Research methods and materialThrough comparative multidimensional evaluation model (MdE) the systems, models and applications of deliberative democracy in selected countries, i.e. UK and USA, are analyzed. Research’s main data consists of citizens’ survey (random sample of 5000), interviews of municipal authorities and the scientific test. The data will be analyzed both statistically and through qualitative methods. Based on the theoretical framework, comparative data and the results of the survey and interviews a model of deliberative democracy for the Finnish health care context is created and tested.Developments so farPlease see the  website of the project.

This reflexiveness can signal emerging problems, enabling what we call anticipatory governance – the ability of society and institutions to seek and understand a variety of inputs to manage emerging technologies while such management is still possible. Through this improved contextual awareness, we can help guide the path of nanotechnology knowledge and innovation toward more socially desirable outcomes and away from undesirable ones.  History  In 2005, the U.S. National Science Foundation announced a set of major grants in nanotechnology in society, including the creation of Centers for Nanotechnology in Society at Arizona State University (CNS-ASU) and at the University of California, Santa Barbara (CNS-UCSB) to pursue scholarship on and methodological and theoretical approaches to the social studies of nanotechnology. With its $6.2 million award from NSF (# 0531194), CNS-ASU is the largest center for research, education and outreach on the societal aspects of nanotechnology in the world.  Specializations and activities  CNS-ASU pursues its goals through two cross-cutting  research  programs: real-time technology assessment (RTTA), including such activity as analyzing research and innovation systems, surveying public opinion and values, creating opportunities for public deliberation and participation regarding nanotechnology decision-making, and evaluating the impact of CNS-ASU activities; and two thematic research clusters (TRC) that investigate equity and responsibility, and nanotechnology, sustainability and urban environments. CNS-ASU also administers the NSF-funded  STIR project  (Socio-Technical Integration Research, #0849101), an international project that studies the extent to which collaborations between social and natural scientists working alongside one another in research laboratories may advance responsible innovation.Major projects and events  CNS-ASU organized the US's first large-scale public deliberative activity on a scientific topic - nanotechnology and human enhancement technologies. The National Citizens Technology Forum (NCTF), held in 2008, involved the full participation of 74 lay citizens in six locales. The citizens completed a pre-test, received a vetted background document, engaged in face-to-face and internet-mediated deliberations, wrote reports from each local group, and took a post-test. Central findings include both those about the substance of the citizens' views of nanotechnologies and human enhancement and those about the nature and quality of the citizens' deliberations. The general portrait of attitudes toward nanotechnologies for human enhancement that emerged was one that strongly suggests that popular unease with enhancement technologies exists alongside hope for nano-enabled therapies. The general portrait of deliberation that emerged was one that strongly supports the contention that lay citizens are capable of deliberating in a thoughtful way that can contribute to public discourse and even to policy decisions.  The full report is available online .  Funding  CNS-ASU is funded by the US National Science Foundation.

This move, that occured in 1965, ended a decade of bitter memories of the famous 1956 Uprising.However invading soviet forces were still in place, but at least distinction between the soviet and hungarian soldiers became possible. Naturally, this move was aimed at the general population to hide the oppressive nature of the regime,but interestingly it caused the most effect to those,who intended to wear these, the soldiers, or at least, a part of them. In Hungary, as in most countries those days, a mandatory draft systemwas in effect. According to this,all males between the ages of 18 and 36 were subject to military service. As with most mandatory regulations in most countries, it usually only applied to the poor. Party members' sonswere transferred to more convenient places, while those dubbed as 'enemies-of-the-system' were dispatched to near-labour camps,referred to as 'Engineering Brigades'. The difference between the poor and the rich, and between the sons of the ruling elite and the ordinary folk were so obvious, that it was crystal clear for everyone. To add more pressure for those, who served their country a system ofpolitical comissariat was working alongside each units. A political officer was operating at company-level -this meant that a party comissar overlooked the daily life of the units. At least one such spook was assigned to every 50-100 men. For an Army of some 120-200.000 it meanthell of a high level of suspicion, one might say. Needless to say, as oppressive regimes go, no opposition parties or even thoughts were allowed to exist, neither in the public, nor in the armed forces. These factors altogether created an atmosphere of suspicion and untrustworthyness. Hence these developments,social groups tended to stick together while on service.Because of the high level of surveillance they encountered, they were secretly aligned into small cells. The first of such groups was the 'Rural Brotherhood', composed of agrarian-background fellow countrymen. Of course, being subject to martial law as soldiers, they weren't keen to commit anything that might be seen as an open revolt or such. Over the decades these secretive groups transformed into secret societies, and divided along their common interests and goals. A number of these operated pretty secretive nets of cells at almost every unit. There were ones that operated in order to help each other to dissidate to the West, others were centered on defending each other against offences. Finally there were some, whose members were trying to make the most of their stay: writing memoires, engaging in philosophical discussions in order to 'Change the World'. Such groups would probably end up in discontent, but as its members were changed every one to three years, there were always fresh blood - and fresh ideas. After nearly fourty years,the Cold War came to an end, and these groups also - however their legacy continued. From around 1989,these societies were transformed their thoughts ontoa whole other theater: the post-Internet World. In August of 2001, thelast such society ceased to exist,with the discharge of its last members from the now democratic Hungarian Defence Forces. This last secret society was named  'The Rabapon-E Brotherhood '. (Its name derived from a strong industrial cleaning solvent that was used at the army barracks at that time.) The former Members of the Rabapon-E created the Freerz Community and spread the light to three continents. Before going online, the Freerz had Units in Australia, Canada, UK, Italy, Germany, Austria and Hungary. Specializations and activities  Freerz Community has specialist Units under development, but basically most Members are engaging in all kinds of tasks.  Major projects and events To name a few recent projects: There was a project a few months back where separate FRZ units (one in Australia, one in Canada, one in Italy and one in Hungary) researched immigration &amp; indigenous reaction to the immigration. Contrary to most such researches We did not focused on socio-political factors, but the access to resources by the various groups. The research concluded that the immigration and the violent xenophobic phenomenon are both based on the lack of access to resources and information. The exiles/refugees are usually denied access to resources and information at the starting point of their journey, while those sounding xenophobic voices are too lacking reliable information (and as such resources) about those coming into their countries. Of course there are many more circumstances that are effecting this issue, but We managed to prove valid points that were put into practice by some western countries immigration laws since. Also a Freerz Unit was specifically designed a framework structure for an international disaster relief/response model that could be quickly activated, logistically feasible and staffed with eager and trained volunteers. Parts of this latter project were implemented in the aftermath of the Haitian earthquake in 2010. Funding  The Freerz Comunity is a non-profit organization and has no funding plans.

Its aim is to help create a more direct and transparent democratic form of government, using the possibilities given by the Internet.  History  In a democratic system, the rules of social coexistence can only be valid if people, after having created their own laws, accept and observe them. In today’s representative democracies, the legislature doesn’t work like this. Citizens do not participate in the process of law making; they usually follow the events passively as a supporter for one of the political parties.  In view of such background we have decided to create an application specially built for the social networks which would take the importance of spontaneous organizations to a higher level by honoring the demand of voters for a greater say in the policy-shaping process and which would maximize the force of public pressure exerted on politicians while also prompting people to participate in public matters who have lost all faith in common representation built upon a consensus.  The Webvotr project has been established by a team of youngsters committed towards democracy and the development of new web technologies.  Major projects and events  Currently, we are working on a project called Webvotr, a Facebook Application with the goal of providing the possibility for citizens to: - be informed at regional, national, EU and international levels about the motions in Parliament and the decisions of the local governments that effect the citizens;  - to be able to discuss them and send feedback; - to get a more direct say in the central decision-making process through their own initiatives by organising referendums, e-petitions and demonstrations. The application aims to do this by using the mobilising power of the social web. Funding  At the moment we are privately funded and we are in the process of fundraising.

As a pioneer in the field of web-based dialogues, the company has sought to create and optimize cross-media communication between citizens and state for over ten years. Based on the belief in the power of good ideas that grow from the bottom, the company seeks to strengthen democratic processes through greater citizen participation. Zebralog has formulated a number of guidelines for 'good participation'.[1]  As a consultancy, Zebralog strives to enable private and public organizations to enter into a dialogue with citizens. As an agency, the company takes care of the technical implementation, and as an institute, Zebralog conducts research projects and provides expert opinions.  Origins and Development  When the founders of Zebralog met, the term ""online dialogue"" did not exist yet, at least not in Germany. At the end of the nineties, Matthias Trénel was investigating the success factors of discursive practices on the Internet at the Social Science Research Center in Berlin. Oliver Märker was working for GMD Research Center for Information Technology (now Fraunhofer Institute IAIS) in research projects to develop software that visualizes and structures argumentation. Hans Hagedorn was working as moderator of social discourse for the Hammerbacher consulting firm. When the three met each other at a workshop in 1999, entrepreneurial spirit was in the air. They were bursting with ideas and together developed visions of collaborative processes in politics, the Internet and society, as inspired by ideas from urban planning over psychology to IT.  First projects for the city of Esslingen and the Berlin Senate Department for Urban Development, as well as numerous publications followed. At this point of time, Daniela Riedel, who was working with Hans Hagedorn at the Internet Start Up City&amp;Bits, joined the team. In 2003, the newly expanded team registered their non-profit association under the name of Zebralog e.V. This allowed them to further develop online dialogues for the Berlin Senate Department for Urban Development as well as for other cities, state offices and ministries. Research institutes commissioned Zebralog e.V. with studies on e-participation. In 2007, the company started to transform the registered non-profit association Zebralog e.V. into a corporation and had become pioneers and experts in e-participation. To date, they are pioneers in shaping the digital society.Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingKnow who organized or funded this initiative? Help uscomplete this section!Specializations, Methods and Tools  Zebralog offers comprehensive expertise from a single source. The organization provides individual advice throughout the whole participation process: from conception to implementation and evaluation. [2] Experienced online moderators structure the discussion and promote issue-oriented dialogue. The dialogue is continued at meetings,  workshops  and tours of the site. By consolidating and evaluating the results, Zebralog produces a detailed, goal-oriented image that accounts for different perspectives.Major Projects and Events  Zebralog has conducted more than 100 participation projects, notably municipal dialogues,  participatory budgeting  and  eConsultations .  For example, theCologne participatory budgeting[3] has won several national and international awards. The city of Cologne introduced its first participatory budget in 2008, becoming one of the first cities in Germany to do so. Every year since then, the citizens of Cologne have been given the chance to voice their ideas as well as to rate and comment on others’ suggestions concerning the best ways to spend and save money. In cooperation with the  Fraunhofer  Institute IAIS (Dr. Josef Wehner), Zebralog designs and realizes the Cologne participatory budgets.  Zebralog was also involved in implementing thecross-media municipal dialogue ""Dresdner Debatte""aimed at large-scale citizen participation regarding the structural development of Dresden's urban areas, particularly the central square that surrounds the Frauenkirche (Church of Our Lady), an area known as the Neumarkt (New Market). The website  www.dresdner-debatte.de , an online forum open from June 8 to July 8, 2010, gave anyone interested in the debate a chance to weigh in with their opinion. Extensive information informed website visitors about the history and architecture of the Neumarkt. They could publish their ideas and wishes for the historic heart of the city by submitting their own proposal, or by joining discussions others’ proposals. In addition to the online platforms, an information box was set up on-site at the Neumarkt, in which citizens could ask questions and discuss their ideas and concerns with experts from the urban planning department of Dresden. In 2012, the project received a special award for ""sustainable participation"" at the administration congress ""Effizienter Staat"".  In 2011, Zebralog conducted an  eConsultation among students  on behalf of the Ministry of Innovation, Science, and Research of the Land North Rhine-Westphalia. Students of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) had the opportunity to raise their voices about study conditions at their university or college via the website (www.besser-studieren.nrw.de). More than 19,000 completed surveys and more than 14,000 student comments confirmed the necessity of offering this opportunity.  Zebralog has also written expert opinions, for example for the city of Vienna, and offers online platforms that help manage citizen concerns and complaints in cooperation with Mark-a-Spot.

They believe in complete freedoms of speech and openness, free from censorships, wire-tapping, and the inability to be anonymous. In reference to privacy laws, they hope to gain the same rights as their parents did 40 years ago (TEDxTalks). Those rights including, not being virtually monitored or tracked on the Internet and postal service. Ultimately, they want to be able to send information or letters on the Internet or by postal with ease and comfort of privacy, because 40 years ago this sort of tracking did not exist to such an extent.As for in the United States, The pirate movement also believes in eliminating the current welfare system and creating higher taxes but with a minimum income assurance, meaning that every person is given enough money to live off of. “This forces businesses to compete against the government and treat their employees well, as well as give them a decent wage. It also prevents any person from starving, going without healthcare, reduces violence and break-ins significantly” (McCrea).Their message is based on the idea of politics of protest, protesting to change the status quo. One can compare their missions of protest similar to those like the Greens who wanted to protest pollution and Liberals who protested the royal’s overbearing power control on the church. These protests and movements became established politics and policy makers all because they turned something into an ideology, similar to the Pirate Party (TEDxTalks).  HistoryThe Pirate Party originated in Sweden by founder Rickard Falkvinge on January 1, 2006, originally being named “Piratpartiet.” Non-supporters had giving them the name of ‘pirates’, in hopes of shaming them from the idea that they like sharing and copying (TEDxTalks). Falkvinge expresses that he became a politician by talking about politics in a pub and later increasing to a political leader that has parties present in over 50 countries.Upon creating the party, Falkvinge saw three objections he had from the European Government in 2005. First off, there was the software patents debate in parliament that would criminalize knowledge. Secondly, there was copyright monopoly harshening in Sweden. And lastly, the data retention direction in Sweden, which would make all cellular phones contain tracking devices issued by the government (TEDxTalks).The first steps Rickard Falkvinge took to starting the Pirate Party was making a manifesto on an online chat of a mere few sentences. Within his first day, the party consisted of about 300 activists and supporters. At this point in the creation of the party, elections for the European Parliament of 2006 were only eight months away. There was increase in support and activisms within those months and they received .68% in the first election. However, due to the lack of funds, Falkvinge was forced to beg for money and donations, ultimately being chastised by non-supporters and tabloids. For the reelections 18 months later, the Pirate party received 7.13% votes and gained two seats in the European Parliament (TEDxTalks).Specializations and activitiesThe official Pirate Party can be broken up into different sections depending on location and region around the World. This allows organization and ease when planning meetings or gatherings because people and members are relatively close together. Pirate Party International (PPI), a non-governmental organization founded in 2010, helps to connect the party together even at such a large spectrum (PP International). It reinforces guidelines and communication, as well as promoting the cause, for all Pirate Parties internationally. The PPI bridges the gap for all Pirate Parties and can help establish new local parties in select countries. Pirate Party members are extremely diversified, coming from different backgrounds, allowing the ability for deliberation within the group possible and accessible. There are currently 29 active members from five continents that assist to the needs and run the PPI organization (PP International). Within the members, there is a board of directors who deliberate on issues regarding the organization and external issues manages the PPI.The United States also has many local parties of pirates. They can be labeled as the United States Pirate National Committee (PNC) and then categorized more within states individually through membership. The PNC originated with the mindset of bringing the United States parties together, similar to the PPI. By having a centralized organization and committee, they can have collaborating and deliberation between local state parties and promote events properly.Within the PNC, there are also different levels of membership, member and observer states. Member states have established parties with delegates who attend the National Committee meetings. Members are authorized to have complete voting privileges at deliberations and have the authority to approve new members by a majority vote. Observer States are encouraged to attend national committee meetings but do not posses the same status as member states. Observer states can eventually gain membership but must establish an organization with enough activists and members. (United States Pirate Party).Participation SelectionParticipation in Pirate parties is voluntary, anyone can join. The best way to get involved is to sign up at one of the Pirate Parties websites, chat, contribute, or through social media. Some Pirate parties offer Student Internships, where students can get college credit for helping their pirate party. If you wish to ask them a question you can email them asking them about anything you like.Deliberation, Decisions, and Public InteractionJust like any other organization, Pirate Parties through out the world hold meetings via web chat where people can bring their ideas for the Pirate Parties forum, government crowd sourcing, platform, website, and campaigns. They have a public forum for new participants to introduce themselves to other participants. Find out about current events and get links to articles and commentary.  The meetings forum includes the months meeting agenda, and any other issues that need to be addressed. The political council forum is for extra meeting discussions on topics like civil liberties write up, privacy write up, protecting free culture, and democratic engagement. Along with other forums for decision making for standing committees, projects, parties, local events, and records/archives.Influence, Outcome, and EffectsIssues they hope to tackle are copyright law. Reinforce and protect fair dealing. Decriminalize non-commercial sharing and to limit copyright to commercial use of a product. Pirate parties believe the internet is a invaluable good, and hope to resist any censorship, and regulation of the internet. Part of their belief is that they feel this is a violation of our First Amendments rights, to be protected from having their mail read, especially over the internet. They seek to reform Election and Lobbying laws, limiting the amount of power and money politicians can receive in private donations. Tackling direct democracy and participation, without the fear of repression. Supports social economic justice and the value of the little people over large corporations the 1%.Analysis and CriticismPirate Parties have been known for their lack of solid Platform and coherence in sticking to policies. As well as admitting to having gaps in their resources, people worry they may be connected to neo-Nazi National Democratic Parties.

This organization, formed in 2010, was founded by individuals and groups upset by numerous incident involving the misuse and abuse of the ‘blasphemy laws’ and religion in politics. This organization is a combination of many groups and organizations throughout Pakistan. These groups include: Professionals, NGO’s, trade unions, student unions, political parties, and individuals. Citizens for Democracy works to promote the principles created by the Charter of Democracy and hopes to build upon the work of the 18th Amendment, political parties and stakeholders.  One of CFD's primary objectives is to create a democratic culture in Pakistan. Part of this focus includes work to counteract religion in politics and state affairs. To do this they must call upon all of its members to unite in a stand against the current usage of the ‘blasphemy laws’ and religion in politics.  Posting the tag line “Power to the people”, this organization wants to achieve results by empowering the people of Pakistan. To achieve the organizations goals, this organization has established core values and principles with which its membership can align. Using these as a guide, Citizens for Democracy opposes laws and customs that discriminate on the bases of race, religion, language, ethnicity, gender, class and economic status. This group backs all measures that defend innocent people from false accusations under the ‘blasphemy laws’. Some reasons people may be falsely accused are personal reasons, dispute, rivalry and professional jealousy. This organization also encourages the use of free speech, as well as, discourse and debate surrounding free speech. They also works against extremism within Pakistan societies. They do this, because extremism can threaten individual’s security and destroy state institutions that are democratic. Citizens for Democracy envisions Pakistan as a place where social justice prevails, there are equal opportunities, and the country can ensure security of individuals lives and property for their citizens. Essentially, this organization is hoping and fighting for Pakistan to live peacefully throughout all national, ethnic, religious, and other communities.  Among the goals that have already been presented, Citizens for Democracy wishes to bring the killer of Salmaan Taseer to justice, as well as, trying to guarantee that all cases of murder are treated as murder and not as religion or culture issues. They would also like to have no tolerance for violence of any kind, start the process of forming complaints against issues of hurtful speech in places of worship, and monitoring the media.  History  On December 19, 2010, this organization was formed at a meeting for Karachi Press Club. This event was held by Professional Organizations Mazdoor Fedrations &amp; Hari Joint Committee (POJAC). This group is an umbrella organization with 82 member groups. Since the creating of Citizens for Democracy, it has brought in two new chapters in Lahore and Ishamabad.  Citizens for Democracy was created originally to fight against the ‘blasphemy laws’, as previously stated. The ‘blasphemy laws’ are rooted in the Indian Penal Code of 1860, specifically in, Section 295-B and 295-C of the Pakistan Penal Code. This Penal Code was introduced while General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq was the leader. Section 295-B was specifically created to protect holy persons of only Islam, which is Pakistan’s state religion. Most recently, Section 295-C was created by the parliament in 1986. This made it a crime to make derogatory remarks involving the Holy Prophet (PBUH). The punishment for violation these two sections could be as extreme as life in prison or death.  In the more than hundred years before Section 295-C was created, there had only been fewer than ten reports of ‘blasphemy law’ cases. However, after Section 295-C was enacted in 1986, as many as 4,000 cases have been reported. Within Pakistan, authorities have charged around 650 people with offenses under the ‘blasphemy laws’. Around half of those cases charged people who were non-Muslims. From these laws, over 20 people have been sentenced to death and two thirds of the cases are in the Punjab Province of Pakistan.  Participation Selection  People are allowed to participate based on their own will, yet they have many calls to action on their website and in local newspapers. This organization not only wants individuals to actively participate, but also wishes to unite large groups through affiliation, as well. Citizen for Democracy provides Pakistani people with the opportunities to fight against how Pakistan’s government is being run currently. Their website details a lot of ways that individuals can get involved on many different levels. On a very basic level, for example, signing up for the blog to get email notifications on new postings. If someone wishes to take more of an active role, members are able to repost articles and posts on to other social networking sites. If the desire is to fully engage with the organization, members have the option to contact the organization directly to figure out ways to become more involved on the face-to-face/local level.  This website offers a lot of information for people who are interested in learning more about the organization as well. It provides news stories and articles directly related to their core principles and values. This includes information on activities of individuals, group, and other organizations, notable and relevant events (past and present), and ways for individuals to voice their opinions through comments on their website and Facebook, for example. Their website also highlights the events, awareness programs, and rallies that they participate in. These events are for those who want to participate and are used to build up support for the overall goals.  Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction  The primary method that this organization uses to empower its membership and drive change is that it presents the citizens with enough information for individuals to create an informed decision about how their country is currently being run and to offer ways on their website and other social networking sites to get involved if they want to support this organization. This organization not only, allows readers to post comments on the articles posted on the website, and post the articles to other social networking sites, but it also facilitates meetings and events. The meetings are open to any individual and organizations to attend. There is an event page that announces upcoming activities in advance or provides a summary or recap of recent events. Utilizing social media, Facebook pages have also been established to help people to get informed and also share the information with others. One specific item Citizen for Democracy is taking on is filing a formal complaint against Sultan Mosque cleric Munir Ahmed Shakir for provoking people to violently act out during his Friday sermon.  Influence, Outcome, and Effects  This organization has generated very positive results, because it has provided a way for citizens to demonstrate peacefully about their desires for democracy, tolerance, and justice. Citizen for Democracy is an alliance of many groups and individuals that all have a common desire to support the direction and influence the outcomes of this organization’s involvement across the nation. These individuals and groups come together to urge repeals of the ‘blasphemy laws’, pushing an amendment of these laws, discuss these topics with expert scholars on the topics, creating events, meeting with others who feel strongly about the topic and challenging the ‘blasphemy laws’ in front of the Supreme Court. These organizations have already come together with many positive outcomes, such as, bring people together, creating events to promote awareness and creating a website for people to come to that are interested. This is, because they provide citizens with opportunities to work together in a unified stance and demonstrate peacefully about the desires surrounding the topic.  As previously stated, Citizens for Democracy is a coalition of many groups that all influence the direction and outcomes of the organization. Some of these groups include Sindh High Court Bar Association, Pakistan Medical Association, All Pakistan Newspaper Employees Confederation, Mutahida Labour Federation, Karachi Union of Journalists, Pakistan Workers Federation, All Pakistan Trade Union Federation, All Pakistan Clerk Association, Democratic Labour Union State Bank of Pakistan, UBL Workman Union, National Bank Trade Union Federation, Karachi Bar Association, Pakistan Nursing Federation, National Trade Union Federation, Sindh Hari Committee, Govt. Sec. Teachers Association, Pakistan Hotel and Restaurant Workers Federation, Mehran Mazdoor Federation, All Sindh Primary Teachers Association, Sindh Professor Lecturer Association, Malir Bar Association (Karachi), Pakistan Trade Union Federation, Railway Workers Union Open Line Workshop, Mehran Railway Employees Welfare Association, and All Pakistan Trade Unions Organizations.  Analysis and Criticism  Unlike organizations that protest violently, Citizens for Democracy provides an outlet for citizens to voice their opinions peacefully. It provides both online and in-person ways for people to access education. Online it explains exactly what they do as an organization, the changes they are working to support, and they provide many articles to read to stay up to date about what is going on. Though there are many of these articles on their website, they do not add them frequently. There has only been one new article posted in the last month. Unfortunately, lack of current content can also adversely affect membership involvement, because there is less need to check the web site on a frequent basis.  Although this is a very good organization, it supports values and principles that are often controversial in Pakistan, so it faces challenges and also has its critics. One comment by Ali Kazmi is that people are lazy and that getting many people to fight against the ‘blasphemy laws’ and come up with their own ideas will be difficult. Right now they have many good ideas, but Kazmi says these ideas have been hand-fed to them and that this organization may not follow through. Another criticism Kazmi has of Citizens for Democracy is what he calls “perceived external enemies”. Pakistan citizens have a large focus on people, such as United States citizens, as being enemies, without specific reason or example. This can hurt the organization, as well, because it supports extremist view points.  Ema Anis has also criticized Citizens for Democracy. She said that she went to one of the group's events to see how this new organization worked. What she saw didn’t make her feel as though there approach was going to create change. She saw people coming in at their leisure to sign a petition that was sent to Pakistan governing officials about wanting to move away from extremist view points. Though she believes this is a nice idea, she doesn’t believe it has the power to create change. She believes petitions are easy to do, but active participation is hard to get.  Overall, this organization can truly help Pakistan conquer extremism and the ‘blasphemy laws’. It does have road blocks to face, but it have the power and backing to achieve their goals. None of their critics they have gotten so far seem to be detrimental to the organization or the causes they are fighting to support.  Secondary Sources  Anis, Ema.

Thus, their goal is to change the way we deliberate by emphasizing the need for important values and objectives within such conversations. This is achieved through an internet-mediated platform meant for respectful and credible deliberation. The DemocracyLab website fosters this type of environment through allowing participants to rank different values, objectives, and policies of a certain topic.  DemocracyLab users are encouraged to delve into the values behind an issue in order to understand and respect others’ thought processes behind proposed solutions. This idea of value-based decisions has been a unique aspect of DemocracyLab, which separates it from other online deliberation platforms. Using emotions and opinionated remarks can lead to confusion between those deliberating. Instead, values allow people to have a common ground of understanding as the foundation for their deliberation.  DemocracyLab also believes that technology has an extensive influence on making large-scale decisions. As the world of technology expands, more people are able to take part in online deliberation. DemocracyLab is dependent on the participation, knowledge, and opinions of citizens in order to bring everyone closer to the ideal democracy that America needs.  History  DemocracyLab was founded by Mark Frischmuth in July 2006. Frischmuth became interested in political deliberation after the 2004 Presidential Election, when George W. Bush was chosen to serve for a second term. Regarding the results, the media stated that “America voted on its values.” However, this statement did not resonate with Frischmuth, his friends, or his family. That election opened his eyes to a disconnect which existed between the values of the American people and those of the policies being implemented. This revelation was unsettling for him, and he was determined to make a change. Frischmuth then began to take steps toward creating a platform for value-based deliberation. He first sought wisdom and insight from family and friends, who encouraged him to pursue this end. So he applied for the 501 (c)(3) nonprofit organization through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and began to network and interview for the Board of Directors. Once approved, he created the DemocracyLab website. Once the organization started to gain momentum, Frischmuth sought out many respected people for feedback. One specific person who influenced Frischmuth was the founder of  AmericaSpeaks , Carolyn J. Lukensmeyer. She gave Frischmuth insight regarding how to further develop his organization.  A pilot project for DemocracyLab was then launched at the University of Portland, where students used the forum to facilitate deliberation and find a solution to relevant issues at the campus. This project allowed Frischmuth to see the website in action and revealed some shortcomings of the organization. As a means to act on these shortcomings, Claire Adamsick, the Communications Director of DemocracyLab, attended the  National Coalition of Dialogue and Deliberation (NCDD) in order to gain further insight on how to develop DemocracyLab and expand political deliberation amongst the country. As the organization continues to drive forward, more tests will be done to see how the website has improved and regressed.  There is still much room for DemocracyLab to grow into a fully-functional online platform for political deliberation. The current focus of the organization is on team building and developing the website. However, as DemocracyLab continues to grow, the hope is that this will shift to improving the means in which value-based decisions are made.  Open Source Software  DemocracyLab was founded using  Open Source Software , which is essentially free software that prevents nonprofit organizations from paying a hefty price for their fully operative websites. The users of the software are able to improve and edit the software by adding the appropriate code for the errors that they find within the program. Thus, every time the software is downloaded, it will ideally be updated and improved by various users to make it just as fast and reliable as other expensive software.  DemocracyLab has used Open Source Software as a means to build their website. Since it is a nonprofit organization, this reliable and free software has opened the doors to improve online deliberation and make the website easy to use for those who are engaged in the platform. This software has helped DemocracyLab become closer to creating a place where citizens, politicians, and leaders can use the site to make informed decisions that are representative of citizens' values.  Open Source Software is devoted to the creation of user-generated content and the ability to obtain it without cost. A primary value of the  Open Source Software Initiative  is free redistribution, and fights to make web use and software affordable. They also do not tolerate discrimination, and allow people of every age, color, and organization to access it.  ParticipantsAnyone is able to participate on the DemocracyLab online engagement platform, as long as they are connected to some kind of social media. Users can only access the forum by logging into their Facebook, Twitter, or Linkedin accounts. However, DemocracyLab stressed that they will not post anything on those social media sites without the permission of the user.  DemocracyLab can be found on  Twitter ,  Facebook , and  Meetup.com . These sites update followers on where they are hosting in-person events and on what issues are currently being deliberated. There are approximately 1,000 followers on Twitter, but this number continues to grow as new members join the movement toward better deliberation.  In order to participate in DemocracyLab, concerned citizens can go on to their website, democracylab.org, and click on the link “Get Involved.” Once on that page, the website lists the various ways to get involved. Citizens can donate money, follow DemocacyLab on Twitter, like them on Facebook, or contact the creators directly. DemocracyLab does not necessarily recruit participants, but instead gives everyone the opportunity to voice their opinions in a civil and respectful manner.Deliberation, Decisions, and Public InteractionsDemocracyLab encourages deliberation through providing an online platform where one can choose their most prevalent values, objectives, and policies of an issue, in order to arrive at a credible solution. They use a system of ranking in order to allow participants to identify the root values of an issue instead of allowing party biases to distort them. This form of deliberation is open to everyone who has access to social media.There is no means to come to a consensus while using DemocracyLab. The online platform is solely used to discuss issues with other concerned citizens in the community. The ability to know others’ opinions will hopefully encourage politicians and those in power to use DemocracyLab as a way to make sounds decisions.  When one enters DemocracyLab’s  online engagement platform , they are able to choose from a series of different issues to deliberate upon. Next, they are brought to a screen with pre-selected values that are representative of the problem at hand. The users can drag and drop different values into categories entitled: “of most importance,” “of least importance,” or “no opinion.” Once the values are classified, users can then rate their objectives and policies in the same manner. This system of ranking allows participants to state their opinions, but prevents the distortion of political party biases and strong emotional attachments from slipping in. In addition, participants are able to see what others had ranked as their most important values, objectives, and policies to help improve their analytic rigor.  Influence, Outcomes, and EffectsDemocracyLab’s ultimate goal is to create a more deliberative and democratic society through improving deliberation on social media platforms. They have made large strides towards this goal through their technological impact on the way people think and make decisions for their community. They have been influenced greatly by several political deliberation groups such as:  AmericaSpeaks ,  Delib ,  Everyday Democracy ,  Healthy Democracy Fund ,  Metagovernment.org ,  National Coalition of Dialogue and DeliberationParticipate DB ,  Policy Census Initiative , and  Ushahindi . DemocracyLab has implemented some of the themes and values of these groups as a premise for political deliberation. The organization is still in its beginning stages, so the effects are not apparent yet. However, DemocracyLab has the potential to facilitate some of the most imperative political deliberations on the internet.  Analysis and CriticismDespite the well-thought-out goals and ideas of DemocracyLab, some criticisms by its users have also come to light. One critique of the organization is that participants can only gain access to the platform through social networking websites like Facebook, Twitter, or Linkedin. This means that concerned citizens who do not use social media sites cannot participate in deliberation via DemocracyLab. Although social media could potentially promote participation (i.e. seeing “friends” using the site), it could also deter participants who prefer to be more private. DemocracyLab stresses that no information will be posted without your consent, but users may still be wary of connecting their political engagements to their mediated social life. Also, it would be beneficial to have more clarification on how to use the website. The “drag-and-drop” system of the values, objectives, and policies may be confusing for some users. More so, it constrains participants to only a few options. Many users of online deliberation platforms want to voice their opinions instead of being forced to choose from a list.  Despite these shortcomings, DemocracyLab seizes the opportunity for a diversity of voices to make sound decisions based through the ranking of values, objectives, and policies. It also fosters a respectful environment by preventing participants from posting vulgar content which is detrimental to political deliberation. Once DemocracyLab has further developed, it could be an ideal way for the community to be engaged in politics and make sound decisions regarding the future of their community and their country.

Americans Elect has focused on achieving three clear goals:Gaining nationwide ballot access for a third presidential ticket to compete in the 2012 race;  Holding the first ever nonpartisan secure national online primary at AmericansElect.org;  Fielding a credible, balanced, unaffiliated ticket for the 2012 presidential race.Problems and Purpose  Purpose: To offer more viable third party options to the American public.  The founders all felt that the status quo is broken; they are exasperated with partisan politics. They wanted a new solution and they felt like a radically new approach would reset the political scene. Two of their core ideas - the importance of a centrist, bi-partisan approach to the solving of our nation's problems and the possibility of an independent, unity ticket for the presidency.Problems: One of the many problems with Americans Elect is exposure.  The reason that the organization suspended itself until 2013 was they weren’t able to get enough American political interest in the general population for their vision. This same lack of interest eventually made them unable to champion a candidate to go on the ballot and declared “no candidate had reached the required level of national support to qualify for Americans Elect's online convention.” Nobody had come close to meeting the minimal threshold of 10,000 votes to win the Americans Elect online primary.Partisanship was a serious problem with the movement. Not too long after they dropped their plans to offer a third party candidate for the 2008 presidential election, they told the press that they would focus on other campaign issues. They then targeted some of their funding towards partisan advertisements in the years leading up to 2012, such as encouragement for the Simpson-Bowles commission to control deficit spending.The group has met with skepticism within the Washington beltway because there has been a backlash of criticism based on the traditional third party argument; people see this as another way to take away disproportional votes from one of the two main parties which could create a counterproductive scenario. The group, Americans Elect, failed to generate interest in possible campaigns from Sens. Joe Lieberman and Lamar Alexander, and its intensive outreach to a host of other prospective candidates, including former Nebraska Sens. Chuck Hagel and Bob Kerrey, didn’t yield much political “buzz” for its efforts.Buddy Roemer, former Democratic governor from Louisiana and former Republican presidential candidate, who on a prime facie basis, fulfilled the politically expansive profile Americans Elect was seeking, topped the list of ""declared candidates."" He had 4,354 on-line support clicks, placing him squarely in the lead of this race, but he failed to qualify for the Americans Elect candidacy before the group withdrew from the 2012 campaign. It was common conjecture that Americans Elect leadership determined that Governor Roemer’s pedigree and maverick positions (e.g. legalized gambling) did not fit neatly into the worldviews of the organization's donors.The most successful candidate on the ""draft"" side, was Ron Paul, who came the closest to the mark with 9,330 ""support clicks”. Ron Paul was considered a political outlier, whose nomination would undoubtedly never have cleared American Elect’s nine-member board of directors, which Phil Ackerman put together and bestowed $5 Million in seed money. The directors retain the right to vet and even veto the candidates to spare the organization embarrassment and even mutiny.History  The history of Americans Elect begins with Unity08, a political movement that attempted to reform the political system by giving voters a viable nonpartisan “third party option in the 2008 presidential elections."" The group was created by political figures, Doug Bailey, former President Carter Chief of Staff Hamilton Jordan, former New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman, and Gerald Rafshoon, and was made up of Democrats and Republicans who wanted to see a change in the status quo, transitioning away from highly polarized leadership and towards a future where Americans had more power to affect the political system. Unfortunately, Unity08 fizzled out with time after the founders, Doug and Rafshoon, quit the team to “draft Mr. Bloomberg” as a potential candidate for President as an alternative to the 2008 election calculus.  Peter Ackerman and Kahlil Byrd established Americans Elect in 2010 as a continuation of Unity08. The goal of Americans Elect was to create the first “nonpartisan, national online presidential primary."" They refined the “Field of Dreams – Build It and They Will Come” strategy to be different from the Ross Perot, Ralph Nader, John Anderson, and Theodore Roosevelt third-party models where the candidate came first, and the money and organization followed. What Americans Elect was trying to do was the reverse. Ackerman and Bird were out to build an organization and handle the tedious task of getting the party on the ballot in every state, all in hopes of enticing an “A” List candidate.Many were optimistic 2012 was the year because there was general unhappiness in the electorate over Congress and the legislature’s gridlock and lack of accomplishment. To not drum up enthusiasm for a third-party in a year like this when neither candidate was prohibitively popular, was almost resignation that a third-party renaissance in American politics will continue to be put off.Participant Selection  Delegates:  Every American citizen committed to improving the political process at the Federal government can join the process. Americans Elect delegates can be any registered voter who signs up online to choose a presidential ticket through successive rounds of Internet voting. Americans Elect’s open membership policies garnered just shy of eligible delegates to be included in the selection process.Candidates:  Much of the attraction associated with becoming a delegate is that delegates and not party leaders have full control of who is drafted as a candidate. Their criterion for possible presidential selection included proverbial qualifications such as being a United States Senator, a president of an organization with a large member base, a ranked military officer, Governors, Cabinet portfolios, etc. Such lofty credentials qualifications were not necessary in the end because all constitutionally eligible United States citizens are permitted to run for President of the United States.Nominee:  In order to qualify for the primary ballot, a single candidate with the qualifications listed above needed only 10,000 support clicks from ten different states. The initial phase of voting was intended to weed the competition down to six contenders. If any ticket received a majority they would immediately become the nominee. Without that being the case, the top two individuals who received the most votes would face off in another round of voting to determine the nominee.Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interactions  This group received substantial media coverage during the beginning of their organization. It slowly tapered off as time went on and a candidate didn’t emerge. Political movements are typically built around compelling personalities or causes, but not technology, and neither personality or causes materialized for Americans Elect. Despite widespread discontent with the two-party system and near-record numbers of people saying that they would be open to voting for a third-party candidate, the future of another major political party emerging after the failure of Americans Elect to field a viable candidate in 2012 appears impractical.The perception in many politico circles is this was a dubious end for a group that carried a number of high-profile backers in the political strategist and donor community and who, as of earlier this month, had secured ballot access in more than half of the 50 states. Elections in a Republic like the United States are winner take all with the Electoral College, so there will be a clear victor elected, without all the coalition-building that comes with a parliamentary system. Like any other secular industry selling homogenous goods or services with a high barrier to entry like commercial aircraft, high-speed mainframe computers and political parties, usually duopolies emerge, e.g. Boeing vs. Airbus, Cray vs. IBM, Republicans versus Democrats. The only dynamic that might not force voters into two camps may be non-secular in origin, which is something Unity08 wanted to avoid at all costs.There are lots of small “third parties” out there, but they rarely win major elections. The few political “independents” in Congress, like Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, are people who get elected not because of some structure someone else set up, but through their own political skill. And they end up caucusing with one party or the other anyway, as Senator Sanders caucuses with the Democrats.Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  There hadn’t been a credible third-party candidate since 1992 when Texas businessman, Ross Perot, garnered an impressive 19% of the popular vote and created a novel dynamic and uncertainty among the pundits in the race between President George Herbert Bush and Governor Bill Clinton. Ross Perot also ran for president as a third-party candidate in 1996, but his backing had dwindled to only 9% of the electorate.The defection of Bailey and Rafshoon supplanted Unity08 of much its mainstream support on behalf of a third-party strategy largely because the notion of “Draft Blomberg” was met initially with a fair amount of enthusiasm. However, a poll conducted by Quinnipiac University  found that 61 percent of New Yorkers thought Mr. Bloomberg had a “moral obligation” to serve out his full term, and Mr. Bloomberg’s reluctance to seize the possibility were catalysts in their “cause célèbre” to dissipate almost as fast as it was proposed.Americans Elect tried to immediately distinguish themselves from the fractionalized 2008 Bloomberg courtship. Right out of the gate, within its first few hours of business to select a nominee through a 2012 online primary, Americans Elect’s 360,000 delegates drafted 52 candidates for president, including well-recognized politicians such as Michael Bloomberg, Jon Huntsman, Buddy Roemer, Warren Buffett, Rahm Emanuel and Condoleezza Rice.What frustrated follow-on actions from advancing this impressive list was the manifest complexity of the process. The delegates could anticipate beginning three rounds of online voting to narrow the field to six candidates. The ultimate winner would be selected in June as the Americans Elect nominee and will appear on the ballot in November. Their running mate would have to be a past member of the opposing political party of the nominee. For instance, if George Stephanopoulos, a former Democrat, was the nominee, a Republican like Condoleezza Rice would be slotted as the vice-presidential candidate. That many conflicting ideologies on the same ticket projected a risky partnership; the actual task of governing for leaders who were political incompatible would result in something as dysfunctional as the Democratic or Republicans parties may do on their own.The result was a hardening of conventional wisdom that a third-party movement will not take much more than a pox-on-both-your-parties sentiment or a single-issue crusade for the effort to succeed. It will also require a compelling candidate and a convincing, comprehensive platform. And it will require money — perhaps several hundred million dollars — to compete with the financial power of the major parties. “This is a very, very major organizational undertaking,” said Larry Jacobs, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota. “It’s like building an army from scratch. And how you do that without significant resources — organizational resources, monetary resources, intellectual resources.” Unfortunately, in era of 30-second “sound bites,” over-complication contributed to failing to generate enough interest in the concept.Analysis and Criticism  At first Unity08 was a “media darling” story because their premise was so simplistic and its simplicity made the idea plausible. A group of political consultants, both Democratic and Republican, proposed a presidential ticket comprise of one candidate from each side of the partisan divide. The founders of Unity08 believed their best chance for momentum was to mine support from the prevalent dissatisfaction from the public’s view that neither the Democratic nor the Republican leaders are doing enough to put the country in the right direction.  Unity08 said it could win by stressing an outsider’s commitment to tackling problems the parties haven’t solved — partly because of the long run of divided government but also, the outsiders say, because both parties are motivated to emphasize partisanship in the cause of self-preservation. “Good and qualified people see politics as so poisonous today that they simply don’t want to participate,” explained Mark McKinnon, a former adviser to President George W. Bush and a major player in the Americans Elect movement. “It’s just damn difficult to break the iron grip of the two-party system.  The irony about Americans Elect to date is the view the only way to repair the perception of flawed democracy involves secret money. There also arises a serious question as to whether an organization whose stated aim is to participate in the presidential election — and has qualified  as a political party  on state ballots — can claim it is a nonprofit organization not required to disclose donors. Americans Elect argues that secrecy is necessary because its underwriters fear retaliation for challenging the political status quo. Its eventual nominee will comply with ordinary rules requiring disclosure and limiting contributions.  The one tangibly positive upshot of Americans Elect, is that it propelled one of its founders, Angus King, into the victor’s circle as the newest Senator from Maine. Angus King has served earlier as an independent Governor of Maine. True to his conviction, Senator-elect King ran as an independent candidate and earned more votes from registered Democrats than the official Democratic nominee.Secondary Sources  1.

The HRCCE designs and implements a deliberative forum in which their citizens can actively and efficiently collaborate with their government. The HRCCE motivate its citizens to be involved in their regions future issues and the Center’s goal is to make sure their public agencies are responsible and clear on issues. The HRCCE is a unbiased source where facts stand strong on even some of the most difficult regional issues. The center reaches out to the public so everyone has a chance to understand the issues that the region is dealing with and brings in the public voice that has long been over-looked.  Problems and PurposeThe HRCEE center plans to make big steps towards obtaining a more deliberative democracy in their region. Problems in today’s deliberation arise from public opinions not being heard and big companies and organizations usually running the show. The main problem is that the public depends on their government to follow through with decisions and implement them, and more than a few times, the public has been left frustrated and angry. The American belief is that public deliberation is directly tied with the government and that is not happening anymore. Too many times has the public felt like they are not a priority when it comes to the government making decisions and society demands access to the government through participation options. In partnership and combined ventures with the region’s public and private universities and local governments, the Center intends to expand a sturdy civic commitment program of research and practice customized to the southeastern Virginia region, structuring the region’s own lasting ability for civic enhancement.  HRCCE will provide an institutional resource within southeastern Virginia which public agencies may access either to help in designing participation plans an agency will conduct, or, as direct implementer of a participation program using small or large group facilitation processes and practical information skill.  There are three main aspects to HRCCE’s pathway;  First, the inclusion of citizens in the public choices related to their region’s quality of life and future improves the quality and sustainability of public decisions and supports responsibility and clearness.  And second, that citizens have both rights and duties to participate in the shaping of their community and all public decision making will be improved by the knowledgeable commitment of citizens.  Lastly, these prospective enhancements come from changes that occur over time. This is a new advance to public decision making and it requires a change in the relationship between citizens and government. The new advances come about due to our world changing. Deliberation is not what is used to be in our founding fathers’ times, there is so much change that has happened since. New technologies, new ways to communicate (i.e. the internet, email, blogs, twitter, etc.,) new issues, new media, basically a lot has changed. That change will come with new experiences and new admiration for the power of community teamwork.  HistoryThe origin of the Hampton Roads Center for Civic Engagement was an initiative intended and managed by Jim Babcock and the regional group - Future of Hampton Roads. The initiative had a main goal to basically strive for opportunities that would make the Hampton Roads region more willing to efficiently make the region connected and more willing to deliberate. Regions can be regarded as “economic engines” of the future so this initiative was to make sure that the future of Hampton Roads was going in the right direction and therefore the HRCCE was born.  The future of Hampton Roads, Inc. was founded in 1982 by a select few of Hampton Roads community leaders with a promise to improve the present and future quality of life for citizens of Hampton Roads. As a non-partisan and non-profit organization, the Future of Hampton Roads, Inc. depends mostly on individuals and businesses ready to support it financially and accepts no funds from political subdivisions.  Participant SelectionAnyone can participate in this organization, who actively wants to participate in diversifying deliberation. Whether you are a resident of Virginia, or a resident from another state, you may participate. Hampton Roads Center for Civic Engagement has many events outside of the state of Virginia and many online forums to participate. You can even participate through writing directly to them. The main resources and the most promotion will take place in Virginia because the main motive is directed towards the area of Hamptons Roads and their local and surrounding residents.  Deliberation, Decisions, and Public InteractionThe HRCCE looks out to different programs and agencies to provide opportunities for the public to promote and maintain more deliberative interactions between the public and the government. Programs like Deliberative Polling©, AmericaSpeaks©, Citizen Jury©, and Study Circles©1 and many others, have already been used by regions around the U.S. and even internationally. These programs do a great job of pin-pointing specific issues that are of legitimate public concern. The HRCCE’s plan is to bring these effective programs to the Hampton Roads region, while specifically customizing their function to the region’s public makeup which consists of 16 independent cities and counties, and to southeastern Virginia’s social and economic environment. HRCCE will supply an institutional source within southeastern Virginia which public agencies can access to assist in coming up with participation plans for an agency to conduct. By doing all this, the HRCCE plans to implement all these various resources and programs to achieve their end final goal of having a civil public population that knows how to deliberate based on many different factors like knowledge, interaction, respect, critical thinking, analyzing, reasoning, and understanding. The HRCCE is generating much help from these various programs to ensure that their citizens from Virginia and many surrounding cities have the chance and ability to learn in a way where public deliberation will be done in a way where it is the most efficient method.  The HRCCE makes sure it also works with other organizations to achieve the highest level of deliberation. In May of 2011, the HRCCE was invited to join the Kettering Foundation’s “family” of Centers for Civic Life. This invite resulted due to the HRCCE’s hard work to make sure their citizens are a part of public problem solving. This invitation consists of the HRCCE entering a “joint learning relationship” with the Kettering Foundation and also other Centers for Civic Life. What this means is that all these centers will be working together on various issues as research for problem solving and answering the Kettering Foundation’s two main questions: “What does it take for democracy to work as it should?” and “What does it take for citizens to shape their collective future?” as stated by the Kettering Foundation. One example of a active issue that the HRCCE Board is working on is the high school dropout rates. The different kinds of participant involvement that the HRCCE is using consist of conducting interviews and also encouraging the public to discuss in online surveys that are posted on the organization’s website.  The HRCCE is very active in making sure they utilize public-decision making by partnering with various different organizations. The HRCCE has also partnered up with the City of Virginia Beach to include citizens that want to make a change to the city’s future of transportation. Citizens of Hampton Roads and city officials have agreed with the HRCCE that they would like to see “Envision Transportation,” which is a community conversation on transportation choices in Virginia Beach, to grow into an endeavor to bring the local government closer to the citizens to continue to achieve public-made decisions. The citizens agree with the local government to analyze possibilities together when it comes to the future of transportation for Virginia Beach.  Influence, Outcome, and EffectsThe HRCCE is so people have a safe neutral place where everyone feels invited to the table. The HRCCE encourages, supports, and sustains activities and organizations that promote regionalism, and pursues the vision of a political union representing the region. Basically HRCCE’s main goal is to bring back a form of deliberation that has been lost through the years due to corruptness and just not bringing attention to the issue. The end effect that the HRCCE hopes to achieve is to have a system of deliberation that will provide the most richest reasoning and thinking when it comes to arguing about and agreeing on certain decisions. Just being able to deliberative with one another in a manner that is respectful and profession will automatically yield the best results.  Analysis and CriticismThe HRCCE hopes to create opportunities for everyone’s voice and opinions to be heard in Hampton Roads. Their main goal is to make sure they create a deliberative democracy and help their community make knowledgeable decisions with communal dialogue.  Even though the HRCCE creates the perfect atmosphere for respectful diverse deliberation, there are still problems that can arise. If there is a majority of one group in a certain communicative hall, the minority will feel overpowered and also this is going to have a little bit of bias because it is based in Virginia. Views and opinions will always be different according to what state you are residing in. The only problem here that can be a huge factor is the region. If this HRCCE organization primarily focuses on residents specially in Hampton Roads, how will those residents even see the different opinions and views from surrounding states and even further to the coasts? Hopefully the HRCCE will really take into consideration the surrounding regions’ ideas and thoughts into implementing their deliberation motives and methods.

Box  6,,Montevallo,Alabama,35115,United States,33.100675,-86.864156,Non-Profit or Non Governmental,,,,,,,,,,,,,educations,,,,"  Mission and PurposeThe David Mathews Center for Civic Life wants to educate organizations and communities on how to engage in deliberative discussion and its benefits of reaching collaborative solutions. Their mission is to, “foster infrastructure, habits, and capacities for more effective civic engagement and innovative decision making.” They believe that communities have the ability to address their own concerns by bringing together unique voices in lateral meeting formats to decide what they can do together, as opposed to asking authority figures to intervene and solve problems for them (McKenzie,“Rebuilding Our Community: What Should We do?”).The focus of their educational workshops is to improve communities’ ability to convene, work together to make creative decisions, and learn from the interactive experiences of forums and workshops. 
 In addition to educating the public on the deliberat­­ive process, the David Mathews Center also wants to foster democracy by bringing Alabama citizens together for deliberative conversations and helping them take action on an issue of community concern. These deliberative conversations focus on a range of important issues and allow for citizens to consider a number of solutions alongside their potential consequences, and then reach a working group decision. Origins and DevelopmentIn the 1990s, The Center was founded originally as the Alabama Institute for Community Leadership and Development. This institute hosted annual workshops to teach communities the skills necessary for deliberative discussion. These workshops based their structure on resources developed by the National Issues Forums. 
 The Institute became the Alabama Center for Civic Life in the early 2000s. The Center became a 501 (c)(3) and expanded their mission to working with communities on national issues in conjunction with local issues. 
 The Center was renamed to honor David Mathews in 2008. David Mathews served as the secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare during the Ford administration during which he worked on restoring public confidence in government and reforming the regulatory system (“David Mathews”). David Mathews is a former President of the University of Alabama and is currently President and Chief Executive Officer of the Charles F. Kettering Foundation in Dayton, Ohio(“About Us”). 
 Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 The Mathews Center is primarily funded by the Citizenship Trust and the American Village. The funds from the Citizenship Trust are shared with the Center for the development and education of citizens on the process of deliberation. 
 The University of Alabama’s New College funds the overseeing staff member and interns who work within the Jean O’Conner-Snyder Internship Program. This collaboration of the memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the Center and the New College in which the interns assist and participate in the many programs that the Mathews Center offers to the community at large. 
 Vendor contracts with community foundations also assist in the funding of the Mathews Center for forums in which they will participate 
 Due to the non-profit status of the Mathews Center they use Conveners, people who donate their time and services to put together forums. These 40 Conveners from 30 counties perform a wide range of tasks such as sending out press releases, finding locations for the forums to take place, sending out email invites and much more(McCauley,2012). Specializations, Methods and ToolsThe David Mathews Center for Civic Life wants the public to participate in and be educated about their role in democracy and how they can improve their ability to make creative decisions. To this end, the organization helps citizens build deliberative decision making skills and creates opportunities for citizens to discuss issues that are important to them. The Mathew’s center conducts forums and workshops for communities and hosts a research internship program alongside the University of Alabama’s New College. Its methods of engagement include issues forums, citizen congresses, innovation workshops, and various community service learning programmes. 
 Major Projects and Events 
 The Center’s signature programs are the Alabama Issues Forums (AIF), the Coaching Community Innovation Workshops (CCI), the Teacher’s Institute, Citizen’s Congress, the Jean O’Conner-Synder Internship Program, and their joint learning programs with The American Village. Alabama Issues Forums (AIF):The Alabama Issues Forums (AIF) bring Alabama citizens together in deliberative discussion to prioritize their issues of concern and then reach attainable solutions that can be maintained. These discussions discourage the divisions created by debate and encourage “actively listen[ing] and think[ing] through real solutions to issues, while also considering the trade-offs and consequences associated with the actions discussed.” (“Signature Programs: Alabama Issues Forums”). The AIF is based on the belief that, “ordinary citizens can and do make a significant impact on the issues that concern them and that opportunities for deliberative decision-making strengthens their work” (McCauley et al. “2009-2010 Alabama Issues Forum Report”). 
 AIF uses National Issues Forums (NIF) materials and issue maps created by The Center to foster deliberative experiences. The issue maps are created for the participants to use as a reference for how to talk about the issue they are discussing. These provide a framework for “careful weighing of attractions, bothersome aspects, costs, consequences, and trade offs among different courses of action”(“Signature Programs: Alabama Issues Forums”). The maps provide important background information and three possible solutions, each with pro and con arguments. These issue maps allow for participants to see alternative perspectives prior to the deliberation taking place (McKenzie et al.“Dropouts: What Should We Do?”). After the forum has been completed,The Mathews Center then provides annual reports to the public describing the information that they gathered from the AIF that reflect how citizens are thinking about issues in the areas of “citizen responsibilities, education, economic development, and public health”(“Signature Programs: Alabama Issues Forums”).This information is gathered through post-deliberation reflections and questionnaires completed by the participants. 
 The 2009-2010 AIF used the NIF issue book entitled, “Democracy’s Challenge: Reclaiming the Public’s Role,” to discuss why citizens are not participating in public life or engaging in their communities as much as they have in the past 50 years. They addressed these issues of concern in 21 communities across Alabama with over 400 citizens. 
 The 2010-2011 AIF, “Our Community, Our Future: The Role of Citizens in Solving the High School Dropout Situation,” was decided upon by the people of Alabama when asked what community issues concerned them. Approximately 1,000 citizens in 30 counties participated in 40 forums to deliberate the dropout situation in Alabama. The issue was further explored through a Citizen’s Congress in June of 2010 to develop an issue map for the AIF, “Dropouts: What Should We Do?” . The center provided neutral moderators and recorders for every forum and each deliberation was carefully recorded. Seven major themes developed out of the 40 deliberations which revealed “a statewide dialogue with cross demographic agreement” on numerous important aspects of the dropout issue. After the deliberations, communities committed to take action through projects or initiatives to help solve the issue.The Center aims to encourage and increase civic engagement by acting as a forum for the community to gather, come up with a creative and tangible solution and take collective action. They want participants to move from the deliberation in to securing commitments to act on their solution, one of the seven democratic processes that the Center utilizes and believes in(McCauley,2012). An example of action that was taken after this forum involves a group of high school students, Future Problem Solvers, from Russell County. These students created a community resource situation website that provides links to resources that could assist students who need help in order to graduate high school. These students also interviewed a number of high school dropout and created a documentary based on their findings and they have also produced a number of skits that are used in middle schools to educate younger students about the issue(McCauley,2012)(“The Central High School Dropout Project”).The Mathews Center was one of three sponsors for an event titled, “Making Community Decisions about Alabama’s Dropout Situation.” The event encouraged deliberation and the solutions that resulted from the AIF by connecting organizations that focus on eliminating the dropout rate with citizens and communities, enabling civic action. 
 The 2012-2013 AIF focus is on the issue of bulling which was identified as a problem during the 2010-2011 AIF. The Center compiled research to create an issue map entitled, “Bullying: What is it? How do we prevent it?” in which three frameworks detailing potential actions and consequences guide the participants through the deliberation. The Center participated in the 2nd Annual Auburn University Anti-Bullying Summit, “Be a Hero, Take a Stand” by holding a workshop entitled,“Citizen’s Congress: naming and Framing the Bullying Issue.” The workshop provided The Mathews Center with the framework for their AIF issue map. The AIF deliberative discussions are using the issue map to come up with creative solutions to the bullying problem in Alabama. Coaching Community Innovation Workshops (CCI)Coaching Community Innovation (CCI) workshops are “designed to improve community capacities to make innovative decisions, secure commitments to act together, and learn from experiences”(“Coaching Community Innovative Workshops""). CCI workshops take place annually and include moderator and convener development workshops, reporting-out events, naming and framing workshops, and civic networking events. 
 Moderator and convener development workshops consist of a shortened forum experience, a discussion on moderating techniques, and a mock forum in which participants practice their moderating and recording skills. The shortened forum is an opportunity for participants to observe the moderator’s techniques. The following discussion focuses on the DMC Moderator Development Handbook which outlines the aspects of moderating, questions to encourage deliberation, and provides ways help manage conflict. After the discussion, participants practice what they learned by participating in a mock forum in which participants take turns moderating and recording. The workshop ends with reflections on moderating and convening. 
 Naming and framing workshops allow for participants to define and raise questions about a problem, and then create a framework for decision making in which the community will deliberate. The naming process begins with discussing the many pieces involved in an issue and then discussing the relationship between the public and the issue at hand while taking personal concerns into account. To frame the issue, the discussion then gets centered on three approaches during which the citizens approve the framework and come up with suggestions to improve it. The participants then come up with examples of solutions and the consequences that might result. Teachers’ InstituteTeachers’ Institute provides teachers with, “the understanding, skills, and tools to enhance lifelong civic learning and increase student engagement in the classroom”(“Teacher's Institute""). Teachers practice deliberative skills, problem analysis, and moderator development exercises through an extended series of interactive sessions. The Mathews Center holds one annual Teachers’ Institute at the American Village in Montevallo, Alabama. 
 Teachers participate in a shortened forum as an introduction to deliberation, they listen to presentations on how to incorporate deliberation into the classroom, and participate in discussions about the content that they were learning. They participate in a mock forum in which they practice their moderating and recording skills and the Institute concludes with teachers discussing ways that they can use deliberation in their schools. The Institute emphasizes the connection between teaching, learning, and democracy and how incorporating deliberation into the classroom can increase “civic engagement and ownership of learning”(“Teacher's Institute""). 
 The Teachers’ Institute wants participants to learn and implement deliberation into classroom learning about current events and prepare students for participation in a democracy. Teachers learn to apply NIF in the classroom to national and state standards and also practice deliberation, problem analysis and moderator development. The Institute also provides teachers with the experience of deliberative conversation in a decision-making forum, they try out different ways to teach students deliberation, and the teachers study a variety of testing methods to use when fostering civic learning in the classroom. Citizens’ CongressCitizens’ Congress is an event that brings citizens together to focus on issues of concern in Alabama. Large discussions allow participants to name and frame a problem by, “sharing what they hold valuable in relation to the issue, identifying community-based approaches to addressing the issue, and sharing and actively listening to a variety of viewpoints on the issue”(“Citizen's Congress”).The Mathews Center then uses the information gathered at the event to create an issue book or map to help deliberation during an AIF. 
 Citizens’ Congress helps the Center name and frame an issue prior to every AIF. It is a biennial event that is open to public. 
 A Citizens’ Congress took place on June 23, 2010 at the American Village where citizens were invited to help assess the dropout issue from the 2010-2011 AIF. 170 citizens participated in creating a decision making tool for the AIF. 
 Another Citizen’s Congress took place at the “Be a Hero, Take a Stand” Summit in June, 2012. The congress focused on naming and framing the bullying issue by taking their values and relating them to the bullying problem, discussing community solutions, while sharing and listening to diverse voices which were compiled into an issue map to be used during the 2012-2013 AIF. The Jean O’Conner-Synder Internship ProgramThe Jean O’Conner Snyder Internship Program, started in the 2008-2009 school year, is a community-based research internship program directed by The Mathews Center and the University of Alabama’s New College. The program takes students from surrounding universities and provides them with learning experiences in which they “research the use of deliberative practices to develop an on-going community capacity to address common concerns”( “Interns”). 
 The students work with communities in the state to develop community-wide deliberation. The interns represent a diversity of majors and their research projects examine the possibilities for encorporating deliberation into their fields of interest. Joint Learning Programs with American VillageThe Mathews Center works with the American Village to create community learning programs for the thousands of students and teachers who visit the American Village annually. 
 Various retreats, workshops, and the Teachers’ Institute take place at the American Village. 
 “Founded in 1995, the American Village serves the Nation as an educational institution whose mission is to strengthen and renew the foundations of American liberty and self-government by engaging and inspiring citizens, leaders and stewards”(“Mission &amp; Goals”).

Its main responsibilities include evaluating the 2010 United States Census in order to determine new  Senate ,  Assembly  and  Board of Equilization  districts for the next decade. [3]  History  Prior to 2010, redistricting in California was conducted by the California legislature. Since the party that controls the Assembly and Senate will appoint its own members to the redistricting commission, the entire process was marred by partisan politics. In fact, between 2000 and 2010 the  California Congressional Delegation  was so safe that only one seat switched parties in 255 races. [4]  It was for this reason that a group of concerned citizens desired for an independant commission to take over the redistricting process. These citizens began a campaign for a voter-approved redistricting commission and hired  Kimball Petition Management  to collect the signatures required for ballot submittal. As an initiated constitutional amendment, 694,354 signatures were required for qualification. These signatures were submitted to election officials on May 6, 2008. On June 17th, 2008, the California Secretary of State announced that a check of the signatures established that the measure had indeed qualified as Proposition 11.California Proposition 11 (2008) Election Results [18] (As of 11/14/12)Yes 6,095,033 50.9%No 5,897,655 49.1%  The commission was created in November 2008 following the passage of  Proposition 11  in California (also known as the  Voters First Act ). The passage of this measure created the commission and tasked them with redrawing the Senate, Assembly, and Board of Equalization districts in California. In 2010,  Proposition 20  (also known as the  Voters First Act for Congress ) was subsequently proposed. Proposition 20's passage assigned the responsibility of redrawing the state’s Congressional District boundaries to the California Citizens Redistricting Commission as well. The Commission faced opposition from incumbent California politicians because ""many safe seats in the Legislature could suddenly become competitive."" [6]California Proposition 20 (2010) Election Results [19] (As of 11/14/12)Yes 5,743,069 61.3%No 3,636,892 38.7%  The passage of Proposition 11 and 20 authorized changes in the  California Constitution  which required that the commission have 14 members, comprised of three groups of registered voters—5 who are registered with the largest political party in the state, 5 who are registered with the second largest political party in the state, and 4 who are not registered with either of these parties. The commissioners were selected in November and December 2010 and were required to complete the redistricting by August 15, 2011. [9] Actions by the commission to adopt district boundaries required the approval of nine commissioners, including at least three “yes” votes from each of the three groups of commissioners. [9]  Commission Selection and ProcessesCommissioner ApplicationAfter the passage of Proposition 11 in November 2008, the  California Bureau of State Audits  (BSA) adopted the stipulations to the Constitution on October 20, 2009. This paved the way for the Applicant Review Panel to be randomly selected on November 16, 2009. The website  wedrawthelines.ca.gov  opened with an application to be on the commission. The application opened on December 15, 2009 and was available through February 16, 2010. Soon after, the BSA decided to add new regulations which stipulated that the first eight commissioners selected would interview and choose the remaining six.  The  California State Auditor  estimates that over 30,000 applications were received for the commission. After preliminary eliminations of incomplete applications and those not taken seriously, a secondary application was sent out to those who applied on February 17, 2010 and was available until April 19, 2010. 5,000 applications were resubmitted and from those a three-member panel from the BSA reviewed the applications and conducted interviews to establish a pool of 20 Democrats, 20 Republicans and 20 applicants from neither major party. This list of 60 names was then forwarded to the  California State Legislature  on September 29, 2010.  After the 60 finalists' names were received, the  California Assembly Speaker , the  California Senate President Pro Tempore , and the minority leaders of both the Assembly and the Senate jointly reduced the pool to 12 members within each pool as required by law. The Legislature sent this list of names on November 12, 2010 back to the State Auditor who then randomly drew three Democrats, three Republicans and two applicants from neither major party to become commissioners. These eight commissioners were notified of their selection on November 18, 2010 and were quickly tasked with selecting the other six commissioners from the remaining pool by December 15, 2010.Selected CommissionersExecutive DirectorDaniel ClaypoolDemocratsGabino Aguirre - Former farm worker from Santa Paula, CA  Angelo Ancheta - Law professor and legal scholar from San Francisco, CA  Maria Blanco - Vice-President of the California Community Foundation from Los Angeles, CA  Cynthia Dai - A social venture consultant from San Francisco, CA  Jeanne Raya - A commercial insurance agent from San Gabriel, CARepublicansVincent Barraba - Founder of an online marketing company from Capitola, CA  Jodie Filkins Webber - A self-employed insurance litigation defense attorney from Norco, CA  Lilbert ""Gil"" R.

[13]Map Drawing ProcedureThe Voters First Act of 2008 and the Voters First Act for Congress of 2010 amended  Article XXI section 2(d)  of the California Constitution to establish criteria that the Commission was obligated to follow as it began to create the new districts: [3]Population Equality - All districts must comply with the United States Constitutional requirement of ""one person, one vote.""Federal Voting Rights Act  - All districts must ensure equal opportunity for minority candidates to be elected.  Geographic Contiguity - All areas with a district must be connected. An exception is made for islands and peninsulas/isthmus.  Geographic Integrity - All districts must minimize the division of cities, counties, neighborhoods and communities of interest. A community of interest is defined as a population area that shares similar social and economic interests.  Geographic Compactness - All districts must not bypass nearby communities for more distant communities.  Nesting - Each Senate district shall comprise two whole Assembly districts. Board of Equalization districts shall be comprised of 10 Senate districts.Ensuring TransparencyIncumbents, candidates or political parties could not be consulted during the district drawing process. Article XXI section 2(d) of the California Constitution also required that the Commission ""conduct an open and transparent process enabling full public consideration and comment on the drawing of district lines."" [14] Taking this into consideration, the Commission facilitated 34 hearings across the state and had 2700 citizens offer public testimony.  Organizations such as the  League of Women Voters ,  California Forward ,  Common Cause , the  California Chamber of Commerce (CalChamber) ,  Equality California ,  Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) , the  Asian Pacific American Legal Center , the  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) , the  Silicon Valley Leadership Group , and the  Sierra Club  also offered testimony to the Commission. The Commission's  website  also received 20,000 public comments that were taken into consideration. [13] [14]Map ControversySince the process was so transparent, public testimony was often partisan in nature. These citizens hoped to influence the Commission during the hearing process to ensure that the new districts would be favorable to their political affiliation. In a very controversial article, investigative journalism publisher  ProPublica  found evidence that the  California Democratic Party  coordinated with members of the community to manipulate the process. [7] The  California Republican Party  was quick to call for an investigation, despite the fact that many members of the media believe the California Republican Party to have conducted similar efforts. [5] In response, the Commission issued a press release to ensure the public that it ""had its eyes wide open"" and ""were not unduly influenced."" [7] The State Auditor conducted a brief investigation and determined that even if the testimony was of partisan influence it was the first amendment rights of those citizens to do just so. Thus, no action needed to be taken and any further complaints could be taken up with the courts. [10]  In 2012, the opponents of the California Redistricting Commission decided instead to take their concerns to the ballot box. [10] On November 13, 2011 several concerned citizen sponsors turned in 504,760 signatures to qualify a ""map repeal"" measure to the ballot. If passed, this measure would ask the California Legislature re-draw the State Senate districts while leaving the other maps intact. On February 24, 2012, the  California Secretary of State 's office announced that the measure indeed qualified and would be classified as Proposition 40; although the language was very confusing to the average voter. [10] A ""Yes"" vote meant that the districts would be kept while a ""No"" vote would ask the California Legislature to redraw the districts once more.  While originally the California Republican Party took a stance against this proposition it was decided in Mid-July that they would abandon their ""No on Proposition 40"" campaign. [11] The Republican Party believed that after seeing primary election results the new districts were sufficient and switched their endorsement to ""Yes on 40."" Thus, both the California Republican and Democratic parties campaigned in favor of 40 to the point in which it was approved in the November 6, 2012 General Election. [11]California Proposition 40 (2012) Election Results [20] (As of 11/14/12)Yes 7,002,203 72.1%No 2,711,824 27.9%Commission Result Certification  The California Citizens Redistricting Commission certified its new district maps on August 15, 2011. [9] It was put to a vote using the ""supermajority"" that was stipulated by Article XXI section 2(c) and 2(g) of the California Constitution. Maps for the State Legislature passed each with a 13-1 vote. Maps for the Congressional districts passed with a 12-2 vote. [6]  Courtroom ChallengesVandermost v. BowenIn January of 2012, the  California Supreme Court  declared that the State Senate redistricting maps generated by the California Citizens Redistricting Commission were constitutional; finding them in compliance with both the  United States Constitution  and the California Constitution. [21] The justices also ruled unanimously that pursuant to 2008's Proposition 11, the new maps could be used in the 2012 General Election (Even if Proposition 40 qualified for the ballot, which it did).  In response to the filing of additional lawsuits, the  United States Department of Justice  granted preclearance of the Commission's maps under Section 5 of the Federal Voting Rights Act. [8] This streamlined the map implementation and ensured that they would take effect during the June 12th,  2012 Presidential Primary  even if litigation was still pending. [8]  Long Term Impacts  While it can be difficult to judge the impact of non-partisan redistricting right away, independent studies completed by the  Public Policy Institute of California , the  National Journal , and  Ballotpedia  have concluded that California now has some of the most competitive legislative districts in America. [1] This creates a breadth of opportunities for elected officials to face their constituents and ensures that elections are more focused on substance than turnout.  After the November 6, 2012 presidential election many in the media and the political community are using the California Citizens Redistricting Commission as precedent for future independent redistricting commissions. While its results may have caused some longtime incumbents to lose primary races, it opened up a ""new broad base of constituents"" as stated by newly elected Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell who beat 30 year incumbent Pete Stark. [12] While the article agrees that the immediate impact has been impressive, ""it will take a few elections to truly judge the effectiveness of California's new voting and redistricting reforms."" [12]  Funding  Under Proposition 11, the Legislature would continue to appropriate funding for the redistricting of U.S. House of Representatives districts. In addition, this measure authorizes funding (outside of the Legislature's budget) for redistricting efforts related to legislative and Board of Equalization districts.

704,organization,Pirate Parties Across the World,https://participedia.net/organization/704,Description not available.,0,2012-11-13,2012-11-14,1754,ashleydavis,https://participedia.net/user/1754,1754,ashleydavis,https://participedia.net/user/1754,en,,,,,,United States,37.09024,-95.712891,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human, national, governance,," Mission and Purpose  The Pirate Party’s goal is to change laws that are compromising copyrights and the rights to privacy. They believe in complete freedoms of speech and openness, free from censorships, wire-tapping, and the inability to be anonymous. In reference to privacy laws, they hope to gain the same rights as their parents did 40 years ago (TEDxTalks). Those rights including, not being virtually monitored or tracked on the Internet and postal service. Ultimately, they want to be able to send information or letters on the Internet or by postal with ease and comfort of privacy, because 40 years ago this sort of tracking did not exist to such an extent.As for in the United States, The pirate movement also believes in eliminating the current welfare system and creating higher taxes but with a minimum income assurance, meaning that every person is given enough money to live off of. “This forces businesses to compete against the government and treat their employees well, as well as give them a decent wage. It also prevents any person from starving, going without healthcare, reduces violence and break-ins significantly” (McCrea).  Their message is based on the idea of politics of protest, protesting to change the status quo. One can compare their missions of protest similar to those like the Greens who wanted to protest pollution and Liberals who protested the royal’s overbearing power control on the church. These protests and movements became established politics and policy makers all because they turned something into an ideology, similar to the Pirate Party (TEDxTalks).  History  The Pirate Party originated in Sweden by founder Rickard Falkvinge on January 1, 2006, originally being named “Piratpartiet.” Non-supporters had giving them the name of ‘pirates’, in hopes of shaming them from the idea that they like sharing and copying (TEDxTalks). Falkvinge expresses that he became a politician by talking about politics in a pub and later increasing to a political leader that has parties present in over 56 countries.  Upon creating the party, Falkvinge saw three objections he had from the European Government in 2005. First off, there was the software patents debate in parliament that would criminalize knowledge. Secondly, there was copyright monopoly harshening in Sweden. And lastly, the data retention direction in Sweden, which would make all cellular phones contain tracking devices issued by the government (TEDxTalks).The first steps Rickard Falkvinge took to starting the Pirate Party was making a manifesto on an online chat of a mere few sentences. Within his first day, the party consisted of about 300 activists and supporters. At this point in the creation of the party, elections for the European Parliament of 2006 were only eight months away. There was increase in support and activisms within those months and they received .68% in the first election. However, due to the lack of funds, Falkvinge was forced to beg for money and donations, ultimately being chastised by non-supporters and tabloids. For the reelections 18 months later, the Pirate party received 7.13% votes and gained two seats in the European Parliament (TEDxTalks).Specializations and activities  The official Pirate Party can be broken up into different sections depending on location and region around the World. This allows organization and ease when planning meetings or gatherings because people and members are relatively close together. Pirate Party International (PPI), a non-governmental organization founded in 2010, helps to connect the party together even at such a large spectrum (PP International). It reinforces guidelines and communication, as well as promoting the cause, for all Pirate Parties internationally. The PPI bridges the gap for all Pirate Parties and can help establish new local parties in select countries. Pirate Party members are extremely diversified, coming from different backgrounds, allowing the ability for deliberation within the group possible and accessible. There are currently 29 active members from five continents that assist to the needs and run the PPI organization (PP International). Within the members, there is a board of directors who deliberate on issues regarding the organization and external issues manages the PPI.The United States also has many local parties of pirates. They can be labeled as the United States Pirate National Committee (PNC) and then categorized more within states individually through membership. The PNC originated with the mindset of bringing the United States parties together, similar to the PPI. By having a centralized organization and committee, they can have collaborating and deliberation between local state parties and promote events properly.Within the PNC, there are also different levels of membership, member and observer states. Member states have established parties with delegates who attend the National Committee meetings. Members are authorized to have complete voting privileges at deliberations and have the authority to approve new members by a majority vote. Observer States are encouraged to attend national committee meetings but do not posses the same status as member states. Observer states can eventually gain membership but must establish an organization with enough activists and members. (United States Pirate Party).Participation SelectionParticipation in Pirate parties is voluntary, anyone can join. The best way to get involved is to sign up at one of the Pirate Parties websites, chat, contribute, or through social media. Some Pirate parties offer Student Internships, where students can get college credit for helping their pirate party. This will also allow Pirate Parties to continue being very popular amongst the younger generation. Individuals can also get involved by managing Pirate Parties Internationals social media sites by volunteering part time. responsibilities for volunteer social media networkers will help develop an on going social media plan. While also updating, planning, and strategizing emerging trends and opportunities. Volunteers must monitor, track, interpret and leverage all social media trends. Main function is to supervise and regulate Pirate Parties International's social media and platforms.  If interested parties wish to ask them a question, you can email them asking them about anything you like by going to their website.Deliberation, Decissions, and Public InteractionJust like any other organization, Pirate Parties throughout the world hold meetings via web chat where people can bring their ideas for the Pirate Parties forum, government crowd sourcing, platform, website, and campaigns. They have a public forum for new participants to introduce themselves to other participants. Find out about current events and get links to articles and commentary. The meetings forum includes the months meeting agenda, and any other issues that need to be addressed. The political council forum is for extra meeting discussions on topics like civil liberties write up, privacy write up, protecting free culture, and democratic engagement. Along with other forums for decision making for standing committees, projects, parties, local events, and records/archives. One of the events the Pirate Parties International puts on is Pirate Con. An annual national convention of all pirates around the World. That holds conferences in London, UK. At Pirate Con people have the opportunity to watch debates and find out what's going on in Pirate Parties. The participants input is used as a platform that helps shape the Pirate Parties agenda in Parliament and other countries. Pirate Con allows people to get involved in many ways. From discussions, trainings, networkings, and sharing their personal experiences and advice.  Influence, Outcome and Effects  The issues pirates hope to tackle include copyright laws, reinforce and protect fair dealing, and decriminalizing non-commercial sharing and to limit copyright to commercial use of a product. Pirate parties believe the internet is a invaluable good, and hope to resist any censorship, and regulation of the internet. Part of their belief is that they feel this is a violation of our First Amendments rights, to be protected from having their mail read, especially over the internet. They seek to reform election and lobbying laws, limiting the amount of power and money politicians can receive in private donations. Tackling direct democracy and participation, without the fear of repression. They also support social economic justice and the value of the little people over large corporations, the 1%.  Analysis and CriticismPirate Parties have been known for their lack of solid platform and coherence in sticking to policies. As well as admitting to having gaps in their resources, people worry they may be connected to neo-Nazi National Democratic Parties. Pirate's are known to copy, paste, and share on the internet. They stand by their civil liberties and choose to rise up and protect their beliefs and now have 2 seats in European Parliament, 15 seats in the Berlin parliament, 150+ seats in local councils across europe, and presently in 56 countries across the world. One major criticism is that people in Hollywood don't believe that there is anything noble about pirate parties or pirate bay, because they illegally steal copyright content and accept money for what they do. Another Criticism of Pirate Parties is that people see Pirate Parties working to reinvent politics. Some say that Pirate Parties are Glorifying hackers as a significant force. While others accuse members of the Germany Pirate parties to be members of the right wing extremist National Democratic party of Germany (NDP). As we know Pirate Parties are ""opposed to pointless storage of telephone and internet connection data of all citizens. That existing copyright law is just as out moded as the current patent system. Rejecting all forms of web censorship or warning messages on illegal web content.""  Pirate Parties transparent participation is easily accessible by supporters and opposers in the ever so controversial parties web chat meetings on their website. People can immediately see what is said and being done in all Pirate Parties meetings.  Secondary SourcesMcCrea, T. (2012, October 17). US Pirate Party Captain and PPI board member.

In many areas of the U.S., minority populations are still discriminated against. For instance, people of color are refused of public services or political participation. According to statistics from United States Census of Bureau, the State of California is composed mostly of people of color and white Hispanic (60.3%) rather than white Americans (39.7%). However, they are still considered a minority population because they are often underserved, neglected, and discriminated against. They still suffer from unequal treatment on jobs, lack of homeownership, lack of higher education.  The main focus of the Greenlining Institute is to arouse the public’s awareness of issues related to racial discrimination and inequality by instituting change, on both an institutional and state scale. The Greenlining Institution provides resources such as training and funding to people of color; additionally, it gives them ability to speak for themselves and also help other people. The Greenlining Institute empowers minorities to speak for themselves and help other people of color. In a word, it not only gives people of color fish but also teaches them how to fish.  History  The Greenlining Institute was founded in San Francisco in 1993 by Robert Gnaizda, John Gamboa and in conjunction of members of diverse ethnic groups: Asian American, African American, and Latino American. The members committed themselves to fight against redlining activities and institutional discrimination, and advocated for social change. After several informal discussions, they first found the Greenlining Coalition with around twelve members. Now the Greenlining Institute has over forty members.  Participation  The Greenlining Institute provides the opportunity to over 100 young college graduates a year to receive leadership skills and gain insight into discrimination facing minority populations. College graduates can apply to the institute’s training program, or fellowship and internship opportunity, via online application and selection, as it says on its institute website, is fair and open to everyone. These participants are given the chance to become directly involved in Greenlining Institute's research and event planning. By involving more youth in social movements and making more people learn about current issues, the Greenlining Institute gives the young equipment of power and skills advocating solutions for problems.  The  Greenlining Coalition  composed of nearly forty member corporations and organizations that all aim to achieve common goal to build an equal society and more opportunity for people of color.  Deliberation, Decision, and Public Interation  The Greenlining Institute holds two-day Economic Summit every year. The Economic Summit is not just literally about economics. It also includes about other topics such as social justice and politics. Mostly, the institute invites leaders from government, banking, nonprofit and community groups to address problems related to these fields and find possible solutions. (The Greenlining Institute) Yet, Economic Summit is sometimes open to the public as well. People can get free admission tickets via  Eventbite  website. Deliberation process is basically to invite presenters, often those leaders, to introduce problems and present their views or stand to other participants. And, in these summits, moderators were often faculty from the Greenlining Institute. Participants of The Economic Summit will brainstorm and work together to develop an agenda.  The Greenlining Institute helps public interaction by conducting researches and publishing useful information to equip citizens, especially minority communities, with more knowledge.For example, it translated California Voter Guide into three languages: English, Spanish, and Chinese. California Voter Guide does help deliberation, decision, and public interaction. For one, provided in three languages, the guide provides more accesses to people of non-native speakers to learn of the election and therefore also help provide equality of opportunity to participate in the politics. For another, California Voter Guide invokes California residents’ awareness of the importance of this election. It offers information that is free and therefore makes people of lower incomes have an access to participate. California Voter Guide helps more people have more knowledge of the election and therefore helps the people make better decisions. Except educating citizens, the Greenlining Institute also questioned politicians for minority communities. For instance, Orson Aguilar, the executive director of the Greenlining Institute, published a news article on how candidates answered and viewed questions raised by the Greenlining Institute about poverty and people of color in the United States. The Greenlining Institute, during the presidential debate, also asked candidates to provide envisions for solving these problems. And, the answer for questions from candidates was “pathetic”, according to timeunion.com and the Greenlining Institute. What the Greenlining Institute was doing is to call presidential candidates’ attention to face the racial issues facing in the United States. And, since it was during the presidential debate, the Greenlining Institute also raised awareness of the audience of the debate.  Influence, Outcome, and Effects  The Greenlining Institute established Leader Academy in 1996, an institution to train young leaders. And, in order to ensure diversity of California public school, the Greenlining Institute uses Facebook, Twitter, and other online sources to connect people of color. Moreover, in response to recent increase in textbooks and tuition, the Greenlining Institute tried to make higher education more affordable by influencing or lobbying politicians and educational institutions. Also, The Greenlining Institute had been successful in using telecommunication technology. The institute collected funds to educate those underserved and low-income communities on the use of telecommunications technology which could help people deliberate and speak up for themselves. (The Greenlining Institute)The Greenlining Institution conducts and publishes many researches in many areas including politics, economics, and education on its own website which is free-access and therefore the public is welcome to learn more about issues and the institution. The Greenlining Institute provides a-year- long fellowship opportunity to youngsters of completed undergraduate degree. The fellowship program will give youngsters opportunity to participate in discussion of policies and therefore make those students have deeper understanding of policies and some related issues and realize importance of the policies and issues.  Analysis and Criticism  The Greenlining Institute has been accused of being money-oriented. According to Consumer Watchdog, the Greenlining Institute favored the side of those corporations and organizations donated much money to the Greenlining Institute. On the one hand, the Greenlining Institute claims itself a non-profit organization working for minority communities. On the other hand, it was accused of not heading to its aim. The followings were examples of incidents the two sources raised. For one, the Greenlining Institute supports Proposition 33 which claimed to be adverse to low-income, new drivers and college students due to surcharge from insurance companies. Consumer Watchdog website argues the Greenlining Institution’s support of Proposition 33 is due to receive of funding from Mercury Insurance Company’s chairman, George Joseph who funded and sponsored Proposition 33. The Greenlining Institute is criticized for not making choices based on helping minority communities but on amount of donation it receives.  Another example is an argument between FTCR (The Foundation for Taxpayer &amp; Consumer Rights) and The Greenlining Institute on the Proposition 9 which rose by FTCR claiming to prevent utility companies, especially those private ones, from surcharging customers and also provide an additional rate reduction. (Smart Voter) The Greenlining Institute was on opposed side of this proposition. Consumer Watch Dog website claimed that the Greenlining Institute did not support Proposition 9 was because of receiving much money from the stakeholders, utility companies.

708,organization,The Center for Voter Deliberation of Northern Virginia ,https://participedia.net/organization/708,Description not available.,0,2012-11-14,2022-07-31,1844,"""Kelly Clarke""",https://participedia.net/user/1844,421204,"""Nina Sartor""",https://participedia.net/user/421204,en,Info@VoterDeliberation.org. ,Info@VoterDeliberation.org. ,,,,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Definition  The Center for Voter Deliberation of Northern Virginia is a non-profit whose main objective is to organize community deliberations with people in the local area. The institution was established in 2009 and was one of the first of its kind. Using a web-based blog platform, they make community members aware of the deliberations they are sponsoring in the area. Blog entries on their website are posted detailing the subject of the deliberation and time and place at which the deliberation will occur and how to become a participant. Subjects of the deliberation are locally chosen. Currently, another function of the website is to make people aware of important news and happenings regarding deliberations occurring worldwide, so the creators regularly post entries regarding vital news about deliberations. The CVDNVA prides itself on being non-partisan and entirely volunteer run.Since their creation in 2009, their motto has been “a chance to be heard is a reason to listen.” The founders, Bill Corbet and Beth Offenbacker, designed this organization with the goal of trying to educate the public on the importance of participation in political life. In the Northern Virginia area, the creators became aware that there was distinct interest in being involved in deliberative discussions on important issues but that there was a lack of opportunity for them to do so. The Center for Voter Deliberation in Northern Virginia ideally wishes to give people that chance, a chance to give their representatives real and constructive feedback on policies and issues in the national and local area. With the formation of this organization, students and community members now have that option, the option to participate in a real deliberation on actual issues.Purpose and ProblemsSince its founding in 2009, the purpose of the Center for Voter Deliberation in Northern Virginia has always been to give people in the community a chance to voice their opinions on a variety of issues facing the American people. It is rooted in the idea that people need to come together and talk about issues, this way they can come to a consensus and give their representatives more accurate information on what the people want. The idea is that America would move towards a more deliberative form of democracy.While the Center for Voter Deliberation of Northern Virginia does give the community an influx of new ways to engage in deliberation, it requires that the participants to seek out their website and find time in their busy schedules to volunteer and participate. Time community members most likely don’t have to spare. Since there is no compensation for their time, the center has to count on people to be willing to participate without an incentive.History  The Center for Voter Deliberation was created with the hope of working with other organizations in the area to design and carry out deliberations on locally selected topics. The founders intended for this to be a way for the community to move towards a more deliberative democracy, a democracy where people think, talk, and act together. For the past few years, CVDNVA has organized numerous study circles, public forums, and deliberations. They developed this organization with the design that with a more educated and involved community of voters participating in the American system, then democracy will thrive. Through the deliberations organized by the CVDNVA ideally the informed voters will be able to make better decisions and improve the community. The Prince William Study Circles was even the winner of the Virginia Statewide Neighborhood Organization of the year award in 2009 (Brookshire 2009).Participant Selection  The structure of this organization is dependent on it being non-partisan; therefore participation is volunteer based. In an effort to be inclusive of all those eligible to vote, participation is open to anyone living in the community and willing to participate. For the convenience of participants, deliberations usually take place in public areas such as a library or cafe. Their desire to remain a non-partisan organization requires that a participant’s personal views are not taken into consideration when selecting participants. Therefore they are asked no questions about personal beliefs before being selected to participate. The ultimate objective is to foster discussion between regular citizens who want to discuss issues that are affecting them. Being passionate about issues is very key to the success of these forums.In addition, the online deliberations on Second Life are open to anyone. On their blog, they will post information about times and the issues that will be discussed and then people who want to participate need to create an avatar on Second Life and then return to The Center for Voter Deliberation website and register their avatar on the blog entry.Deliberations, Decisions, and Public Interaction  The Center for Voter Deliberation of Northern Virginia strives to promote deliberations among neighbors in their specific community. Deliberations are often small consisting of around 15 people. The deliberations typically take place in public spaces, like colleges and libraries. There is always a trained facilitator that The Center for Voter Deliberation in Northern Virginia appoints to moderate the session. The first forum planned by this organization took place on April 3rd in 2009. Residents and local experts convened to talk about the choices presented in a  National Issues Forum  (NIF) which frames the issue of Health Care for the purpose of public deliberation. There were four deliberations that took place at the locations of the Prince William Campus, Big Bear Café in Washington DC, Bus Boys and Poets in Washington DC, and Prince William Area Commission on Aging. The forums that took place in Washington DC were much larger and the participants were more liberal overall than the ones that took place in Northern Virginia. Facilitators from CVDNVA helped moderate the deliberation for ninety minutes on three solutions as to how to handle the health care problem. The forum attracted 155 people in total. They didn’t arrive at a consensus, but surveys showed that people wanted lower costs and fewer people uninsured.  Furthermore, they co-convene the Prince William Study circles which currently organize seven study circles in their city which are made up of 15 diverse residents. The study circles are six hours long and moderated by a member of the Center for Voter Deliberation of Northern Virginia. The goal is make a decision on local issues and try and take action. According to the assistant dean of Prince William university life, “We decided to get the community talking and to have a respectful, honest and productive conversation about neighborhood issues. The whole point of the circles is to empower the community to take the initiative” (Musick 2010). The study circles were formed to help community members take action and improve their community.  Since then the organization has entered into the arena of online deliberation as well using a forum called Second Life. People interested in the Deliberation will register on the website and then log into second life at the specific time posted on the website. Second Life is a 3D virtual chat rooms used for many things, deliberations being one of them. While it is online, it allows people to interact just like they would at a real meeting. Before the deliberations, orientations on how to use Second Life are given on specific days because knowing how to use the forum is critical to the success of the deliberation. Once participants are signed up on the day of the deliberation, they are assigned a table and small group within the virtual realm. Each table has a CVDNVA moderator there. Usually the online forums are also sponsored by other organizations around the country in order to create a larger deliberation. For example, The Center for Voter Deliberation of Northern Virginia was one of the 6 sponsors for an online America Speaks’ National Discussion “Our Budget, Our Economy.” During this virtual online deliberation, there was an introduction section, then three choices were discussed, then benefits and trade-offs, and then a wrap up section during the deliberation.  Decisions are most often made through intense discussion of several solutions and then participants attempt to come to a consensus on how to move forward and take action to improve their neighborhood.Influence, Outcomes, and EffectThe Center for Voter Deliberation of Northern Virginia was created with the idea that creating opportunities for people to deliberate on issues would help to educate the public not only on issues but also on how important it is for every citizen to be involved in politics. American citizens are so fortunate to have the opportunity to have a say in the government but so many people do not take advantage of this chance to make a difference. The American democratic system has so much possible potential. By giving people an opportunity to discuss and work through issues, and hear other people’s stances on current problems facing their neighborhood, this helps them to make an informed decision and know exactly how to take action. A well-informed public is critical to creating a more deliberative democracy and a better America.Analysis and CriticismThe Center for Voter Deliberation of Northern Virginia is a way for citizens who want to become more politically active to have an opportunity to do so. Through blog entries they alert the community to deliberations they are sponsoring and to exciting news regarding deliberations all over the world. Barriers to deliberation using this organization could include inequality. Discussion norms could cause people’s opinions to be swayed by participants with a gift for speaking and persuasion. One side of the issue could be portrayed in a better light based on who said it and how it is said. An additional barrier could include the spiral of silence. People commonly feel less of an enticement to speak up if they feel like the majority of the group has common beliefs they do not share. Especially since these deliberations are technically non-partisan when the participants are selected they do not control for the possibility of a majority of the group sharing similar political beliefs.Secondary Sources  Brookshire, C.

The Alliance oversees the World Wide Views initiative which attempts to realize the group's mission through time-limited, global consultations on issues being debated or negotiated in international policy forums such as the UN. [1] The Alliance was also established to develop a method of simultaneous, multi-site public consultation. The method - simply called  World Wide Views  - was used for the first time in 2009 and twice more in 2012 and 2015.[2]  Origins and Development  The WWV Alliance was originally established by the  Danish Board of Technology  in 2009 to conduct the  World Wide Views Citizen Participation Project on Global Warming . Due to the success of the Project and the shared values of the partners, the Alliance continued its work on a second  Citizen Participation Project (on Biodiversity)  under the umbrella World Wide Views initiative. Since the first Project on Global Warming, the WWV consultation methodology has been used twice more: first on the topic of Biodiversity in 2012, and then on the  topic of Climate and Energy in 2015 .[1]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingKnow how this organization operates internally?

The project seeks to create a greater intellectual understanding and commitment to participate in the civic life of the United States.  Focused on undergraduates at public colleges and universities, the American Democracy Project has created a collaborative network of 199 public colleges and universities, representing more than 1.7 million students, that are member institutions of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU). The three-year project, sponsored by AASCU in collaboration with The New York Times, will provide opportunities for participating campuses to engage in activities and projects designed to increase the number of undergraduate students committed to meaningful civic actions."" *  Participant Selection  Participants include over 250 colleges and universities who are members of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU). Forty-seven states (except Hawaii, Idaho, and Wyoming) plus the District of Columbia are represented by participants in the ADP. In order to become a member of the ADP, the campus must be members of the AASCU. Potential members must also apply for membership with a letter of interest submitted by the university’s president to the National Manager of the ADP, Jennifer Domagal-Goldman. The benefits and opportunities stemming from involvement with the ADP are incredibly helpful to the students- and there is no membership fee for either student or institution. The ADP seeks to conduct conferences and meetings to better the policies and educational resources to students across the nation.The ADP is a collaboration with the New York Times. It is partnered with the Center for Deliberative Democracy at Stanford University, the Center for Democracy and Citizenship, the Center for the Study of Citizenship at Wayne University, CIRCLE, Epsilen, the National Conference on Citizenship, the New England Resource Center for Higher Education, Public Agenda, The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, The Democracy Commitment, and the Yellowstone Association.  Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction  The American Association of State Colleges and Universities, “holds an annual meeting, sponsors seven national civic engagement initiatives and provides a national platform for AASCU faculty, staff, and students to foster informed, engaged citizens for our democracy.” **Special Days in Action: The ADP participates in days of action during several days per year. These are holidays emphasizing civil action, including holidays such as Earth Day, 9/11, and MLK Day.For example, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the American Democracy Project collaborated on Tennessee’s largest naturalization ceremony in celebration of Constitution Day in 2012. Three hundred people took an oath of national allegiance to the United States of America on the 225th anniversary of the signing of the Constitution.Civic Engagement in Action Series: The Civic Engagement in Action Series are nationwide and campus-wide activities for undergraduates to promote civic engagement. The series focus on national issues and examine American problems and conflicts.America’s Future: Protecting the Fiscal Health of Our DemocracyThe objective is to give undergraduates an awareness about America’s current fiscal situation, educate them about the financial future and assist them (and policy makers) in order to develop solutions that will end, or at least lower, the national debt and deficit. This is important because students need to be aware of the increasing rise of both federal debt and deficit since 1980, and the effects America’s fiscal situation will have on future generations.Campus and Community Civic Health InitiativeThe objective is to find ways to assess both campus and community civic health, and develop a program to improve the assessed health. It also plans to determine how college/university campuses support community civic health. Civic health includes involvement in community groups, discussion of politics, discussing local issues, volunteering, service activities, and political action. This was started in June, 2012 as an effort to improve both campus and community civic health. This is a signature program for the ADP’s 10th anniversary in partnership with the National Confederation on Citizenship.Civic AgencyThe objective is for all citizens, no matter their financial statuses, ethnicities, religions, or geography, to come together and develop the idea of a civic agency. Civic agency is a set of skills needed for collective action. The intent is to change civic decline into centers of civic renewal. This initiative is in partnership with the Center for Democracy and Citizenship.Deliberative Polling®The objective is a multiple part process where campus subjects are tested through “Deliberative Polling” strategies on public issues. The first part includes a random, representative sampling that polls specific public interest topics. Some members of the sample are then invited to deliberate the issue in a public forum, then after the discussion, are asked the original question. Changes of opinion illustrate opinions based on true deliberation and information. Practices created from the Deliberative Polling tests are then used to educate undergraduate students about these issues. This will promote active members of society once these students earn their degree.eCitizenship: New Tools, New Strategies, New SpacesThe objective is to determine how our democracy is transformed by technology, and to educate students about this technology. Strategies are created to teach students about using social media for a “civic purpose.” eCitizenship recognizes the increasing importance of technological tools like blogs, Facebook, or wikis. This is a three year initiative partnered with the Center for the Study of Citizenship at Wayne State University and thirty-five institutions. A sub-initiative is the Informed Citizen Project.  Informed Citizen Project: This is centered on ADP’s civic participation on the World Wide Web. Undergraduates need to be critical of the media and information consumed from that environment. It seeks to develop media and information literacy in regards to civic engagement, and create new programs in college-level media for graduates to be engaged citizens.Global Engagement InitiativeThe objective is to both identify and analyze long-term policies regarding population, resource management, technology, information, economic integration, conflict and security, and governance. It is the only international initiative in the ADP, seeking to educate students about global challenges, and how to make informed judgments. It is partnered with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Stewardship of Public LandsThe objective is to educate participants (faculty members) on the history and science of controversies in public lands, especially Yellowstone National Park. These faculty members will then return to their colleges and universities, where they will develop programs for their students regarding Yellowstone or local public lands. Public lands, such as national parks, throughout the US are sources of contention over ownership rights, environmental issues, potential sources of energy, and general use of land. This is in collaboration with the Yellowstone Association, which supports the preservation of the national park.Political Engagement Project​The objective is to teach students about politics, public policy, and how to become involved in nonpartisan issues. Through this project, undergraduates should develop skills useful in democratic participation, taught in non-partisan and non-ideological environments. The Political Engagement Project emphasizes the importance of involvement in both political and nonpolitical activities.  Meeting Process  The American Democracy Project engages and several different forms of meetings throughout the year. Some of the meetings are annual, while others are conducted more in a conference style focusing in either one specific area or in accordance with one college specifically. The annual meeting typically occurs in October, gives a chance for a larger group of contributors to discuss national issues and take steps toward establishing leadership. Also, once a year, the ADP and The Democracy Commitment meet to convene and discuss their goals for the following year. The American Democracy Project also hosts individual meetings and conferences across the nation throughout the year.2012 Annual Meeting began place on October 29, 2012 and lasted until October 31, 2012 at The Roosevelt in New Orleans, Louisiana. The theme of this year’s event was “Addressing the American Challenge” The meeting focused on addressing the challenge of providing transformational leadership for colleges and universities to help better the achievement gap among students. The 2013 Annual meeting has been set for October 21-23, but the location and general agenda have yet to be announced.  American Democracy Project/ The Democracy Commitment 2013 National Meeting will take place June 6, 2013- June 8, 2013. This will be their third annual meeting. The theme of the meeting, 21st Century Citizens: Building Bridges, Solving Problems, focuses on, “educational experiences and civic skills needed by today’s graduates.” These experiences and skills are necessary for both civic engagement and in the workforce. More than 500 attendees are expected which will include college and university administrators, students, community members, and faculty members. The ADP/ TDC National Meeting will have sessions where topics such as global citizenship, political engagement, 21st century citizenship skills, and service-learning are discussed. These sessions will be in the format of lightning rounds, poster presentations, round table discussions, concurrent presentations, workshops, and panels.  Council of State Representatives (CSR) took place from March 21 to March 23 in 2012 in the nation’s capitol of Washington D.C. In attendance was the American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU) Council of Representatives. Representatives from all 50 states were present and the goal is to advocate for higher education policies for the AASCU institutions.  2012 Academic Affairs Summer Meeting was held in San Francisco, California from July 26 to July 28. The meeting was expected to “focus on the critical tools and elements that are necessary to create a 21st century institution... examining issues such as data analytics, ... working with for-profit providers, ... models for campus-wide internationalization” ***Influence, Outcome, and EffectsThe Democracy Commitment is modeled after the American Democracy Project. Unlike the ADP, it focuses on community colleges throughout the nation. This is to create an awareness for community college students about civic learning, and to foster a participation in democracy.  Film Your Issue is partnered with the ADP. This is a contest for home filmmakers to create a video about issues important to them.Secondary Sourceshttp://www.aascu.org/programs/ADP/http://www.fhsu.edu/adp/http://americandemocracy.illinoisstate.edu/http://www.gcsu.edu/adp/index.htmhttp://www.nytimes.com/ref/college/collegespecial2/coll_aascu_mission.htmlhttp://adpaascu.wordpress.com/http://www.mtsusidelines.com/mtsu-to-play-host-to-states-largest-naturalization-ceremony/http://adpaascu.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/adp-ncoc-campus-community-civic-health-initiative_description.pdfExternal Linkswww.filmyourissue.com Notes  * The mission statement is taken from The New York Times.

Its focus lays in building leadership within smaller community to advance social change. The group supports individual, institutional, and community advancements to improve issues on inequality and injustice through its programs.  The CEL has strived to maintain its status as one of many organizations that encourage societal involvement and promote parity within the United States for twenty years. Its main office is currently located in Seattle, Washington and they are operating few programs such as Gracious Space, Community Learning Exchange, and Nourishing Networks. Following its foundational values, the programs continue to motivate people to engage in greater interests of the society by educating them.HistoryDr. Bill Grace, the founder of CEL began his first social justice actions at an early age and earned a doctoral degree by researching how people utilize their personal passion into taking civil actions. During his doctoral research, he encountered a girl who shared her personal experience of how she became a social activist herself. She explained how her experience as a child - as Dr. Grace did – affected her most in shaping her motivation in leading desegregation in Puget Sound schools.  This greatly enlightened him that raising awareness should begin from the younger generation so he became an educator. He developed the 4-V model which is the keystone of the Center and serves as a guideline for its leaders to place Values, Vision, and courage to critique as their top priorities.  When CEL was finally founded in 1991, Dr. Grace stated that it was founded to be a “catalyst for creating a just society.” While most early leadership organizations in the United States during the early nineties promoted a leadership development model which focused at individual level, Dr. Grace distinguished his center by adding on a different principle of advancing leadership at a group level.  The Center enjoyed its quick expansion throughout nation in its early stage through a strong partnership with the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. Since its establishment, the Center has been dedicated in practicing the rudimentary concepts of Collective Leadership and frameworks for community advancements. Its effort still lay in fostering creative ways to promote harmony of diverse groups of people within a community.  In 2005, Dr. Bill Grace has stepped down from the Executive Director role and is currently continuing his social work through teaching.Mission and PurposeThe purpose of CEL is to direct local communities in a better direction by sharing its core values with the community members in order to cultivate leaders. CEL has worked with various local communities beyond boundaries and ever since it was founded it has worked with more than 15,000 participants from 30 different states. Its mission and purposes are clarified by defining Ethical Leadership, the 4-V Model, and Collective Leadership.Ethical LeadershipThe most basic definition the Center offers for Ethical Leadership is “knowing your core values and having the courage to live them in all parts of your life in service of the common good”.  A list of insightful questions that may help one to strive toward achieving higher level of Ethical Leadership is listed here:  · Will you be the same person at work? At home? In the community?  · Will you have the courage to live out your values when there is pressure to compromise or rationalize?  · How do your values contribute to the common good?The 4-V ModelThe diagram below is what Dr. Grace calls the 4-V model.Value , which is located at the top of the triangle, is what the leaders should base their actions on. Not only do they have to firmly believe in their core ethics, but also they have to commit to them by beginning to modify their daily lives at home and/or at work. Dr. Grace regards this as the integration of both the external and internal values that actually produce an outcome.Vision  enables the leaders to widen their perspectives and “frame” their services. This incorporates the ability to predict how their actions can potentially affect their community in what specific ways. Dr. Grace argues it is crucial for a leader to truly know him or herself because without a thorough self-reflection, it will be virtually impossible to have a vision for a greater entity.  Voice is the instrument that is necessary to pronounce the visions of the leaders. They need to persuade the public with a rhetoric that is appealing and convincing, but also with credibility. Dr. Grace explains that this is a part of “finding one’s voice” to express and deliver their ideas and visions more effectively. It is useful to confirm coherence frequently between Vision and Values because it is possible that the Voice could alter the original intent.  Virtue is located at the center of the model because it is fundamentally another name for Ethical Leadership. Doing what is considered as right and good is clearly part of this component nevertheless this is the overarching glue that binds the former three V’s. The virtuous character, also known as integrity, cannot be attained without transforming one’s values into actions or without an ultimate goal for the entire group. It is suggested that the leaders ask themselves  “How are my values, vision and voice keeping up with the common good?”Collective LeadershipThe official website of CEL defines Collective Leadership as “a way for diverse groups of people in our communities to hold purpose, direction, and action cooperatively”.  The Center supports individual, institutional, and public transformations based on the desire to create a more healthy and inclusive society. The Center emphasizes Collective Leadership from each community member and encourages expanding the individualistic perspective of “I” to a wider angle that is geared toward “We”. And it stresses the potential power “we” create is stronger than an individual one. Consequently Collective Leadership maintains equality by decreasing the distinction between “you” and “I.” Collective Leadership includes willingness to listen to anyone who wants to contribute to the society even if that means they have opposing points of view. It advocates sharing ideas and valuing them because any single idea could be fostered into a stimulant that can possibly bring forth changes. Also, Collective Leadership encourages people to use their individual talents for the betterment of the bigger group. According to  The Collective Leadership Storybook: Weaving Strong Communities , the four common patterns that define and facilitate a new form of social chemistry and Collective Leadership are as followed:  · We take time to form deep relationships with each other.  · We cross boundaries that keep us from working with other who share our purpose.  · We trust community wisdom and tap into it to find the answers it holds.  · We know our story and together imagine the narrative for our community.Additional conceptsService, Polis, and Renewal are three additional key factors that contribute in developing quality Ethical Leadership.Service  is the bridge between Vision and Values because a true, selfless Vision is to be discovered only after providing service that support one’s Values.Polis  is a Greek work that means city and it constitutes the English word  politics . And this is the product of a leader doing the work of articulating the Vision with a Voice in a public context.Renewal  is considered as the last step that takes places while Voice transforming into Values. This is when the works done by a leader actually renews or modify the society’s original state as a result of Polis.ProgramsThe Center has created different types of programs throughout the years including The Confluence (1999-2006), Kellogg Leadership for Community Change (2002), and Youth Leaders of Promise as one of its earliest launching programs. And since 2005, Bill Grace Leadership Award has been given to those citizens who lead the Puget Sound area of Washington with focus on social, environmental, and economic justice. There are several events throughout the year that take in forms of conferences, training courses, and open-conversation sessions. Currently the Center is offering following programs:  Community Learning Exchange (CLE)  The goal of CLE is to foster mutual support for diverse groups of people through sharing diverse perspectives of people with various backgrounds. The CLE program was first established by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation in 2002 and the major contribution of the program comes from sharing knowledge amongst the local citizens while creating personal connections. The program also focuses on school improvements and boosting the high school graduation rate of African Americans in the area. This program provides resources such as 3-day programs and weekly podcasts online.Gracious SpaceThis program is interesting because one of the Center’s publications is named after this program, hence it can be said that this program is an influential portion of what the Center stands for. The Center offers a description of the program as “a simple yet powerful approach” which sets an atmosphere where they invite “strangers” to cooperatively solve problems without biases and judgments. The purpose of Gracious Space is to teach the general concept of safe environment for communication among the local citizens. This program creates an environment for the group members to invite more strangers for more active communication and to discuss what they have learned on specific local issues to arrive at best solutions. The coaching sessions are available every quarter in Seattle area or through personal appointments.Nourishing NetworksThe goal of Nourishing Network is to ease hunger in local communities. The organization’s website says, “Give a man a fish; you have fed him for today. Teach a man to fish; and you have fed him for a lifetime”. This nourishing network concentrates on supporting locally-owned solutions to fill out the existing economical gaps that leave people hungry and provide them with the skills, tools, and resources to sustain themselves. The Center believes that the solution to hunger and nutrition lay in localized networks and that it can be solved if people collaborate. Community members can participate by contacting the program coordinator directly or registering through the blog. Currently, this program is implemented in these areas in Washington State:  · North Shore  · Kirkland  · Issaquah  · Lake Washington School District  · Redmond  · Bellevue  Convening &amp; Dialogue  The Center provides Convening &amp; Dialogues program for deliberation of local members on specific local issues. The Center believes that through the dialogue, it can create conditions for both personal and collective transformations. The program designed and implemented hundreds of gatherings across the country. Through this program, the Center helps people and groups to address complex social issues such as poverty, racial, and educational inequality.Participant Selection and Deliberation Process of ProgramsCEL accepts every type of people as participants within the local area regardless of their racial, age, or educational differences to further advance similar goals for the greater good of the community. The program participants are able to simply call the program coordinator and then they are asked to fill out a short survey about personal values and behaviors. The survey does not ask for the participant’s demographics because they do not select participants by any discriminating means. In so doing, the Center intends on becoming a deliberative organization by advancing one of the criteria of democratic process by respecting any person. It also promotes analytic rigor through the internal journey Dr. Grace endorses. It allows the participants to examine underlying values, which is the very top of the 4-V Model. Lastly, throughout the Center’s programs, the citizens volunteer to evolve as more qualified leaders.  Especially the Community Learning Exchange is very deliberative in that the participants are educated for three days. First the Center teaches the concept of Gracious Space, core values of center, and what activities they are engaged in to create better way for local community. After that, Center’s committee members ask participants compelling questions regarding sensitive issues that their local communities are facing. After each participant has enough time to reflect on the issues, they discuss it together. Throughout the discussion, participants first cultivate relationship and are asked to open up to think about local issues in new ways as. The Center suggests various ways to improve their local community life.Public interaction and PublicationsIn general, the Center makes efforts in publishing free downloads available online for extra resources besides the publications for purchase. They are assimilating to the new technological mediums such as the tablet PCs and e-reader software, which is a way to cater to broader public. They have online forums and weekly podcasts that are broadcast, but the online forums are the more important factor because this is where they give space to the public to openly criticize the Center and its activities. Some of the publications that are currently on sale are:  The Collective Leadership Storybook: Weaving Strong Communities  This book describes the key values of working together that encourage Collective Leadership.  Courageous Collaboration with Gracious Space  In the midst of this rapid changing and increasing diversity within communities and organization, the Center published this book to encourage collaborations as providing frameworks of the Gracious Space.  Gracious Space  The Center not only provides programs of Gracious Space, but also published this particular book with more rigid understandings of Gracious Space. This book explains what Gracious Space is, how it can be used, and how to create it in your community and work place.  Ethical Leadership: In pursuit of the common good  This book is a biography of the founder, Bill Grace, and describes the key values he has developed.  And Kellogg Leadership for Community Change: Crossing Boundaries Strength Communities  This book focuses on more in-depth concept of Collective Leadership, community change, social advocacy and evaluation.Analysis of Influences and OutcomesThe Center seems as though it is an organization operating in an ideal circumstance and has been appraised for creating fair and safe communicating space for the general public. The CEL program was also successful with raising high school graduation rate and assisting spreading the concept of Ethical Leadership in various states such as Montana, New York Texas, and Minnesota. There was a report from Texas that student participants of Gracious Space and CLE were more aptly prepared to enter higher education including Ivy League institutions. There was statistics from Minnesota that the graduation rate of Native American students in public high schools jumped from 18% to 50% after participating in CEL’s programs. Similarly the African American youth population in Michigan graduated with the rate of little over 60%. Additionally, Gracious Space members successfully passed an initiative that created a $133 million-funding to build new schools in the low-income areas of Hispanic communities in Southern Texas.  It is worthwhile to note that the presence of the Center in these areas directly or indirectly influenced these rates. It has been reported that the public compliments that the Center provides networking opportunities between the White community and the minorities as well especially throughout the discussions.  The Center works effectively to improve some of these social issues drastically but it has limitations in that it is a non-profit organization, thus it lacks support to fund enough scholarships at times. Nonetheless this problem is yet to be solved for any non-profit organization around the world.Secondary SourcesDale Nienow, Roger Erskine, Melissa Hamsaki, ed. “The Center for Ethical Leadership Project Annual Report”.

713,organization,Davenport Institute for Public Engagement and Civic Leadership - Pepperdine University,https://participedia.net/organization/713,Description not available.,0,2012-11-14,2012-11-14,1769,tovarm,https://participedia.net/user/1769,1769,tovarm,https://participedia.net/user/1769,en,24255 Pacific Coast Highway Drescher Campus ,,Malibu,California,90263,United States,34.032766,-118.703765,Non-Profit or Non Governmental,,,,,,,,,,,,,planning,,,," Problems and Purpose  The state of California is criticized for not being engaged enough in politics. In addition, it has some of the lowest civic engagement rates in the nation. “ Nationwide, California is ranked among the bottom five in voter registration rates and 46th in the percentage of people who talk about politics with their family and friends a few times a week or more” (Zocal Public Square). Civic engagement is an ongoing issue in California, specifically in the lens of the large political engagement issue when it comes to voting and voter registration. Another area where it is lacking is in social civic engagement such as in volunteering and in speaking with others about politics. What may account for this is that there is found to be an inverse relationship between levels of ethnic diversity and civic engagement according to Sociologist Robert Putnam in his study called “E Pluribus Unum”. Michael Alvarez, a political scientist at the California Institute of Technology claims that there is a social disconnect fueled by the size, population, and diversity of the state which affects the ability of citizens to be connected.  The Davenport Institution for Public Engagement and Civic Leadership at Pepperdine University works to engage the citizens of California in the policy decisions that affect their everyday lives to ultimately help solve California’s public problems. They believe that the states municipal and education leaders are seeking ways to involve the residents of their communities in the important issues they confront (Davenport Institute). Thus, this produces more creative policy solutions and encourages the citizens to be more engaged and committed to the work of self-governance. They work with governments, special districts, regional governance associations, and non-profit organizations to support and promote this civic engagement.  The institute works with city governments, school districts, and civic organizations in three ways. First, it serves as a matchmaker and consultant between municipalities and professional firms. This is how it is able to connect creative leaders with others who might be looking for a local solution to the particular policy issue. Secondly, it acts as a sponsor working directly and indirectly to support citizen engagement projects financially by dedicating a substantial portion of their annual budget to grant-making. The Davenport Institute offers communities financial support up to $25,000 to carry out legitimate engagement projects through their Public Engagement Grant Program. They also bring in outside funding. The third way is by the institute serving as a promoter and advocate for the process of civic engagement through speeches, op-eds, and other opportunities like the “A Place in the World” conference hosted with the Pepperdine School of Public Policy. The Executive Director or Board Members are also available and can be contacted to speak about citizen engagement in the communityHistory  The Davenport Institute was formerly known as Common Sense California. It was founded as a multi-partisan and non-profit organization in 2005.Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction  The institute created a half day training seminar where participants learn the “Civic Engagement Spectrum”; from informing to involving residents, when your city, region, or school district is ready to engage the public, how to develop a positive engagement campaign, important attitude and behavior changes for elected officials, staff, and residents. Lastly, they will learn the five main criteria for judging an effective civic engagement process.  For this particular event people who should attend are city staff (City Managers, Planners, etc.) elected officials (Mayors, Council Members), school district leaders (Supes, School Board Members), county/regional officials and staff. The purpose of this event is to promote public involvement on important decisions that can lead to solutions when managed effectively.  The institute also hosts conferences such as the “Deliberative Democracy in America” which took place on February 23-24th, 2007. It was an opportunity to explore important ways of furthering democracy in California. It was co-hosted with the Pepperdine University School of Public Policy, with the sponsorship by New America Foundation. Those who attended the conference heard from experts and practitioners about deliberative democracy. Leaders of social, cultural, business, nonprofit, and political systems in the state spoke on how they believe tools of deliberative democracy might be useful in California, and what limitations or challenges they observe. On the second day of the conference, they carried out a deliberative exercise that would consider several specific approaches they could take in California.  Davenport has several blogs where citizens can get involved in talking about local issues. In Common is the institutes' Participatory Governance Blog where people can find information about the latest resources, studies, programs, and discussions about Civic Engagement in California, nationwide, and globally. Golden Governance is a joint project between the Davenport Institute and the National Conference on Citizenship (NCoC). Here cities, towns, and counties across the state can rethink about how to approach some of their challenges with the help of public participation. This is a space where local leaders and members of the community are able to share their success stories and work together to provide services and solve problems. The blog Big Society Watch keeps readers up to date on the highlights of the ideas, programs, and controversies about British Prime Minister David Cameron’s “Big Society” agenda which includes his plan to de-centralize services to the local level of government and how this can be related back to civic engagement and local government programs in the United States. The last blog is called Government 2.0 Watch. It offers information relating to how governments around the world use social media, mobile apps, and other technological innovations to interact with their residents  The Davenport Institute also participates in state public engagement projects on multiple government levels; citywide, regional, and statewide projects. They cover a wide range of categories including budget and service prioritization, healthcare policy, participatory budgeting, housing, land use, and transportation. In 2009, for instance, they worked on a project concerning Santa Cruz Online Budgeting. At this time Santa Cruz was “faced with a $9.2MM budget deficit” (Public Policy Pepperdine). Dick Wilson, City Manager, worked alongside Peter Koht, his Economic Development Coordinator to come up with a way to engage the public. The result was the creation of a “Budget Crisis” website which allowed citizens to voice budget reduction suggestions that could “be voted up or down by fellow citizens”.  Influence, Outcome, and Effects  The institute believed that the “Deliberative Democracy in America” conference led to a greater understanding of deliberative democracy by both policy makers and opinion leaders in California. In the recent years, they have witnessed a growth in “participatory budgeting” efforts and municipalities attempting to do the same. Many other cities are considering projects like these. The Davenport Institute conducted the 2008 Citizen Engagement Grant Program. They offered financial aid and consultative support to cities and school districts for legitimate engagement efforts. In three months, they received over 70 submissions from around the state for civic engagement project on subjects ranging from budgeting to school district visioning.  The Santa Cruz Online Budgeting project was said to be a “success in engaging the public” because they received many suggestions. According to the summary, however, only “8% of the city population participated”. In the end 48 positions were cut to reduce costs.  Analysis and Criticism  The events and the outcomes of the numerous projects taken on by the Davenport Institute there is seemingly a lack in participation by regular citizens of the community. Those who are participating, who are invested in coming up with solutions, and becoming engaged tend to be former elected officials, local activists, and city officials. Much of this is due to the fact that the conferences and trainings put on by the organization are largely targeted at these particular demographics.  Ultimately, the institute succeeds in creating opportunities for local leaders to learn about civic engagement and at educating them on how to outreach to residents of their own communities to get them involved in political deliberation. In this sense, the institute mostly influences the participation of regular citizens on California issues indirectly.Funding  James Irvine Foundation’s California Democracy Program  W.K.

The project calls for heavy community involvement and feedback about issues that are most relevant and important to the Tasmanian community. The plan currently includes 12 goals and 155 benchmarks indicating the most important community issues expressed in deliberative discussions in 2000, 2005, and 2011.[1] These goals and benchmarks are monitored and reported on by a Progress Board, consisting of nine members (although legislation was passed by Parliament in 2012 to repeal the employment of the Progress Board, and instead use government agencies to report progress in an effort to reduce state funding to the plan). The plan also requires the Progress Board to issue reviews and recommendations for any addition, alteration, or deletion of current goals or benchmarks in order to ensure the plan is operating at maximum potential and securing a prosperous future for the Tasmanian community.  Problems and Purpose  Tasmania Together was originally created to placate controversial topics in the community, such as the 1998 decision to reduce the number of parliament seats, the decision to permit gambling machines in hotels and bars in 1997, and a conflict about clear-cutting rainforests.[2] The premise was based on another commission called  Oregon Shines , based in the U.S. state of Oregon, which had similar motives to appease conflict by seeking community input.  The purpose of the Tasmania Together plan is to ensure a harmonious and prosperous society for the state’s collective community. It promotes an open government model, which allows citizens the opportunity to freely participate in decision-making based on their views, ideas, and priorities. The system is meant to be cooperative and innovative as to encourage deliberation among citizens and eventually use their suggestions to create a safe and healthy lifestyle for the community as a whole. The plan currently has 12 goals (listed on its website) it seeks to accomplish by the year 2020, when the project’s initial run is complete:  1. A reasonable standard of living for all Tasmanians.  2. Confident and safe communities.  3. High quality education and training for lifelong learning and a skilled workforce.  4. Active, healthy Tasmanians with access to quality and affordable health care services.  5. Vibrant, inclusive and growing communities where people feel valued and connected.  6. Dynamic, creative and internationally recognized arts community and culture.  7. Acknowledgement of the right of Aboriginal people to own and preserve their culture, and share with non-Aboriginal people the richness and value of that culture.  8. Open and accountable government that listens to and plans for a shared future.  9. Increased work opportunities for all Tasmanians.  10. Thriving and innovative industries driven by a high level of business confidence.  11. Value and protect our biodiversity and natural heritage. Sustainable management of our natural resources.[1]  History  In May 1999, Tasmania’s then-Labor Premier Jim Bacon appointed 22 community members from diverse backgrounds to develop a government-funded plan for the state’s future. In July of that year, 60 additional individuals were invited to a three-day conference to research and draft a proposal. The draft was completed at the end of 1999 and sent to 14,000 community members with a request for feedback. A number of deliberative meetings and consultations followed to address comments and criticisms and revise the draft.[2]  The final draft of the plan was published in October 2000 and included 24 primary goals and 212 benchmarks. In order to oversee, report on, and revise the progress of these goals, the government passed theTasmania Together Progress Board Act 2001  , which required the employment of a group of citizens to carry out these duties. The act also mandated the plan be reviewed and revised (if necessary) quinquenially by asking citizens about their past, present, and future priorities and if the plan is adept at meeting those priorities.[2]  A revised plan was published in June 2006 after a number of citizen forums occurred for the first five-year review during 2005 and yielded 12 modified goals and 143 benchmarks. The second five-year review took place in 2010, included over 5,000 citizen participants and yielded a number of key issues to be addressed moving forward while maintaining the core values of the plan. A report on the review and its resulting recommendations was issued to the Tasmanian Parliament in 2011.[2]  In October 2012, the Tasmanian Parliament enacted legislation to repeal the requirement of a Progress Board to oversee the plan. TheTasmania Together Progress Board Repeal Bill 2012  , was passed in order to reduce spending. The Progress Board cut was estimated to save an estimated $1.1 million per year in funding, and was instructed to disband after its final meeting in 2012[4]. Resources of the Board will be redirected to support the priorities of the Tasmanian government after it is disbanded. These priorities include data collection, performance reporting, community consultation and community engagement.[4] Projects such as the “Stats Matter” project (a joint initiative between the government and the Australian Bureau of Statistics which intends to maximize strategic capacity of data collection) and The Tasmanian Government Framework for Community Engagement (which will assist agencies in effective deliberation with communities) will receive the funding taken from the Board. The Tasmanian government believes disbanding the Board is the best course of action to enhance community engagement.[4] The abolition of the Progress Board was met with controversy and concern about the future of the project, with the Tasmania Together chairman suggesting there would no longer be a “spin-free-story” about the plan’s progress and instead be heavily influenced by political agendas.[3]  The initial run of the project is set to end in 2020.  Participant selection  All Tasmanian citizens are encouraged to participate in deliberative discussions and contribute to the Tasmania Together plan through community surveys and verbal feedback. However, a governing board charged with overseeing the plan was established by theTasmania Together Progress Board Act 2001  . The act mandated the Progress Board to consist of seven members who represent a broad spectrum of the Tasmanian community. These seven were appointed through public nomination, taking into account a collective balance of gender and regional demographics. Two additional members included a representative from the University of Tasmania and a person appointed to fulfill the requirement of theState Service Act 2000  .  The Progress Board had the power to carry out any administrative functions necessary in order to ensure positive performance and development of the Tasmania Together plan. It was responsible for researching and collecting data about the goals and benchmarks and then monitor and monitor and report on progress toward achieving them. It also is tasked with developing relationships between different community sectors and revising the plan if necessary.  A bill issued to the Tasmanian Parliament in October 2012,Tasmania Together Progress Board Repeal Bill 2012  , disbanded the Tasmania Together Progress Board. This legislation was passed in the interest of using its resources to fund other projects and create policy to benefit the Tasmanian community. In passage of the bill, the government ensured the priorities of Tasmania Together would continue to address issues Tasmanian citizens maintained as important.[4]  Deliberation, decisions, and public interaction  The project has encouraged strong community involvement and feedback since it’s creation. It promotes a by the people, for the people attitude and welcomes any and all positive participation to secure a healthy future for the state. The project is required by law to hold five-year review sessions and adjust goals and benchmarks as necessary to cater to the priorities and interests of the Tasmanian community as a whole.  Decisions about these adjustments are primarily made through citizen participation. For it’s 10-year review in particular, Tasmania Together held a number of deliberative forums between September and December 2012. This public consultation process saw over 5,000 responses, including 2,178 individual questionaires, 658 online questionairs, 96 written submissions, 1,000 telephone surveys, 1,000 forum attendees, and 334 contributions from students through the  Tasmania Together Youth Challenge .[5]  With the data collected through the 10-year review forums, the Progress Board evaluated the responses of Tasmanian citizens and developed recommendations for additions, amendments, and deletions of the plan. They made significant changes to the plan’s benchmarks in order to greater suit the needs of the public and ensure consistency. They also reviewed how these revisions could be implemented by 2015 and 2020, respectively.[7] Parliament subsequently approved these revisions.  Tasmania Together also has a  website  with information about the project that has been collected since its inception, including previous reviews and revisions of the plan, reports about community involvement, and reports to parliament about the program’s progress. The website also lists a number of ways community members can  get involved , such as becoming a partner of the organization (which allows for more authoritative comments on the benchmarks currently under consideration), changes they can make in their own lifestyles ( for which the organization provides an informational pamphlet ), and through the Acknowledgement Program (which recognizes people who have made substantial contributions to the community). The organization also has an annual youth challenge for Tasmanians under 20 which challenges participants to investigate and evaluate what is important to them concerning the future of the state. . Tasmania Together also has a social media presence on  Twitter  and  Facebook  in order to reach community members of all ages.  Influence, outcome, and effects  In 2011, the Progress Board released a pamphlet outlining the outcomes from the 10-year review consultation process, titled  “Speak Today Shape Tomorrow.”  The pamphlet addressed the project’s goals and benchmarks and recognized key themes that were of major concern to the public during the deliberative forums, including financial strain, health services, education, safety, and sustainability. The Progress Board in turn took these issues into consideration and made new recommendations to the Tasmanian Parliament, which were approved in November 2011.[6] The Tasmanian Parliament is not required to take any specific action in implementing new policy based on the recommendations of the Progress Board, but actively endorsed the goals and benchmarks presented in 2011. The project is intended to continue to grow and evolve to suit the needs of the Tasmanian community until the end of its initial run in 2020.  Analysis and criticism  While the project as a whole is mostly recognized as a positive and beneficial model for the Tasmanian community, it has been criticized on occasion for being too broad and, at times, too ambitious. One of the goals of the project is to completely rid the state of poverty by 2020, which may be excessive and unrealistic. There is also no indication or scale of importance dictating what goals need to be achieved with the most haste, leaving those decisions up to governmental policy-makers who are heavily influenced by partisanship.  The Tasmanian government also heavily funds the project, leaving it susceptible to political bias. While it was necessary for Tasmania Together to initially be funded by the government in order to create a substantial presence and impact, it would be more reasonable moving forward to be run on public support as to prevent partisanship when adopting or adjusting policies. Furthermore, with the repeal of the Progress Board in 2012, there is no oversight to make sure the government is not acting on self-interests, and without these checks and balances, the project will no longer be community-driven.

This organization wants all Oregonian voices to be heard. Majority of people want to be a part of the decision making process, but don’t know where to start. As well, there are people who know how to share their opinions and take part in the decision making process, but don’t always feel like their voices are being heard. Another one of Oregon’s Kitchen Table goals is to resolve these issues and incorporate all Oregon voices into the decision making process. This organization allows for citizens to connect to real decisions in Oregon.  Furthermore, this organization wants to work with the public to create thorough consultations that don’t have a spin on them. Resulting in creating decisions that reflect what Oregonians really want. The more participation the more decision makers can see how Oregonians think. Oregon’s Kitchen Table wants to help identify public priorities in order to make the best decisions. Citizens face tough issues and Oregon’s Kitchen Table wants to establish a simple, easy, online, and in person space for Oregon citizens across the state to face these challenges. This is a collaborative problem solving process.  In addition, Oregon’s Kitchen Table recognizes that governmental trust is low and that input from everyone is very important. They want to bridge the gap between Oregon citizens and decision makers. Overall, as one of the project managers Sarah Giles stated, “Oregon’s Kitchen Table wants to increase public interest in participating in public issues at the local, regional, and statewide level.”HistoryOregon has been working for many years to get citizens involved in public issues, especially after a concerning report that came out in 2010. Phil Keisling, a former secretary of state, stated that, “forty percent of 1.2 million Oregon citizens eighteen to forty were not registered to vote.” This shows how difficult it has become to get basic communication between government and their citizens. Now Oregon is experimenting with a new tool, Oregon’s Kitchen Table. Originally Oregon’s Kitchen Table started off as an experiment in the College of Urban and Public Affairs at Portland State University, launching on May 4th, 2012. The initial pilot was launched on June 11th 2012 and ran until June 22nd 2012. The first results from the first consultation were posted on August 15th 2012. The remaining results were sent out in three sections every two weeks. This pilot was statewide. After success, they started the second consultation on November 8th 2012 and will run until December 15th 2012. The second consultation was created just for Curry County.  This year is also the ten year anniversary of the partnering of the Policy Consensus Initiative and Portland State University which formed the National Policy Consensus Center. This is where Oregon’s Kitchen Table was created.  The name of this organization came from James Geringer. James was a former Wyoming governor and currently is PCI’s (Policy Consensus Initiative) Co-Chair. Geringer stated, “My background reflects a time when folks would get together to resolve an issue or agree on something by dropping by the house, leaning on the hood of a pickup truck for a chat, or going inside for coffee and a visit around the kitchen table. Typically, when we agreed on a course of action, a handshake or a simple nod sealed the deal. Issues were resolved and commitments were made around the kitchen table.” After this the concept developed, the now called Oregon’s Kitchen Table, would be a place to take our dinner conversations and ideas out of the Kitchen and into the public.Specializations and activitiesOregon’s Kitchen Table specializes in public issues and the state’s budget plan. Specifically the Oregon’s Kitchen Table focuses on helping the governor create Oregon’s ten year plan and the 2013-2015 budget. Oregon’s Kitchen Table focuses on certain outcome areas that need to be addressed. In the first consultation there were four outcome areas. Education, healthy people, economy and jobs, and environment issues were discussed in the first consultation. The first consultation was statewide, but the second consultation was specifically for Curry County.  The second consultation is addressing the county services and financial problem (revenue shortfall). The main part of Curry County’s economy comes from agriculture and timber/logging. The issue being faced is the county is losing revenue and governmental funding for the timber/ logging industry. This is resulting in a decline in the timber industry and state revenue. Unfortunately, like most places, Oregon and Curry County have been slow to recover from the economic crisis. The county needs to find another way to fund or come up with alternative solutions for increasing revenue and that’s where Oregon’s Kitchen Table comes in. The second consultation was created to help solve problems like these.How it Works:There are many ways you can contribute to Oregon's Table. The First, take a seat at the table and sign up online. Second, spread the word! Tell your friends about Oregon's Kitchen Table. They need your help reaching out to the community. Also, contact your legislator. Making the legislators aware that this project is important to themselves and their people is a crucial step in making a difference. As well, people can make a donation to Oregon's Kitchen Table. They operate through public and individual funding. Anything helps and they appreciate your support. Lastly, share a photo! Oregon's Kitchen Table has a flicker and facebook page where you can sumbit photos of people at your own kitchen table.Oregon’s Kitchen Table is both an online and in-person space for Oregon citizens to deliberate and have an impact on the decision making process. There have been two sets of consultations. Oregon’s Kitchen Table started off as an experiment. The pilot was statewide and the first consultation was conducted all online. First, the governor and the Department of Administrative Services asked for the public’s opinions and invited them to help prioritize and give input on what they wanted to see happen. This input was for the ten year budget plan and the 2013-2015 budget for Oregon. Next, the advisory board at Oregon’s Kitchen Table creates a series of questions that will help reflect the citizen’s opinions and show how they want things prioritized. These are called consultations. The advisory board is made up of highly regarded leaders that represent all communities throughout Oregon. This group is non-partisan, non-profit, and private which gives them a chance to create consultations that are not biased and don’t have a spin on them. The board also provides information to educate the citizens on the issues and decisions that have to be made. Once the advisory board created a consultation they released it to the citizens that signed up to “sit down” at Oregon’s Kitchen Table. This first consultation was released on June 11th 2012. After that, citizens got a period of time to participate in the online consultation (answering questions, prioritizing, and giving input on what they want to see happen). Once the consultation closed (June 22nd 2012), Oregon’s Kitchen Table reviewed the results and made them available for decision makers, media, and the public. The results were sent out in three sections. This gives citizens a chance to fully take in and comment on the results. Additional results were sent out every two weeks. Each results section had two columns of responses. One was the Oregon Kitchen Table members and the other one was the randomly selected representative sample of Oregonians. To make the results more representative of all Oregonians they ran the consultation twice. Once for people who participated in Oregon’s Kitchen Table and then they gave it to a random selection of Oregonians. In the end, the governor uses the consultation results and feedback to help make decisions that will represent what Oregon citizens want.  The second consultation has been modified slightly. This consultation is not statewide. It was specifically made for Curry County. As well, this consultation is not only online there are opportunities where people can participate in face-to-face deliberation as well online. This consultation was available November 8th 2012 and it will run until December 15th 2012. The rest of the process for this consultation is the same.  Through this process Oregon’s Kitchen Table helps educates the public and creates a real space for deliberation.Participation:Who can participate? Everyone is allowed to participate. They are really looking for Oregon Citizens from all across the state. This way they can collect data from the entire state with a more representative sample. Since Oregon’s Kitchen Table is just getting started, the number of participants is on the lower end. Currently 1,614 people have taken a seat at the table (participated in the first consultation). Oregon’s Kitchen Table is happy with these numbers, but the more participation the better. Given that the organization is still in its growing phase, they run additional consultations with a random sample across Oregon. This way they can ensure more accurate results. Also, so results are not distorted, each participant is even a unique ID and URL for every consultation. This way each citizen can only participate one time per consultation.  Oregon citizens are not the only participants in Oregon’s Kitchen Table. The governor and state departments also play an active role with this organization. The governor takes the results from the consultation, responds to the results, and uses the input in his decision making. Also, as is the case in the second consultation, departments or the state ask Oregon’s Kitchen Table to run a consultation. Curry County specifically asked Oregon’s Kitchen Table to run a consultation for their county.  As well, there are multiple ways an Oregon Citizen can be involved. They can take a seat at the table (participating in the consultations), spread the word to get more people involved, and make the legislators aware that this project is important. Also, Oregon’s Kitchen table has created multiple media outlets for more participation. This would include a facebook page, twitter page, a website, and an e-mail.Having an online consultation can cause difficulties such as; people who want to participate not having internet access, people with disabilities, and language barriers. Oregon’s Kitchen Table has thought about these issues and is working through them. One thing they have done is partnered with libraries for people without internet access. Also they have set up assistance hours at local libraries and colleges for the second consultation. At these assistance hours member will do all they can to make it simple and possible for all citizens to participate. They help with the signup process, creating an e-mail, answer questions, and more.Major projects and eventsWith the help of partners including, American Leadership Forum, National Policy Consensus Center, Policy Consensus Initiative, Program for Public Consultation, Rural Development Initiatives, Oregon’s Kitchen Table is able to host and promote their events through word-of-mouth exposure and financial assistance. These partners also help assist the users of Oregon’s Kitchen Table, who provide access to informational and financial resources to try and provide high quality discussion. Also, Oregon's Kitchen Table is partnering with libraries, to help serve those in lower income areas, and do not have access to internet and other resources to participate in the disscussion of politcal issues.Currently, Oregon’s Kitchen Table hosts ongoing rounds of participation and discussion for various political issues. Once the round ends, they gather the information and publish it for viewers to see how their local area feels about various issues. Based on their website, it seems that anyone can sign-up and join in whenever they would like. Although this program is fairly new, it also seems as if Oregon’s Kitchen Table is beginning to spread the use of its organization by targeting a few various counties as well. Currently, it is Curry County’s turn to deliberate on their issues, and they have about a month to do so. For the Curry County deliberation, Oregon’s Kitchen Table is partnering with several locations such as libraries and schools to assist those who need help accessing resources to help them make informed decisions and opinions.Additionally, Oregon’s Kitchen Table uses resources through social media sites, such as Facebook and Twitter to further and promote their project. With the help of these sites, Oregon’s Kitchen Table keep those interested in participating aware of upcoming events, and dates for the next deliberation period.FundingOregon's Kitchen Table relies on funding through a list of groups, including non-profit organizations, civic leaders, local and national state government leaders, and individual donations. The organization focuses on being formed off of a non-partisan basis through College of Urban and Public Affairs at Portland State University, and in turn, the University is a primary funder of the Oregon’s Kitchen Table. Another large name funder is The State of Oregon’s Department of Administrative Services (DAS). The DAS’s mission is primarily to serve the people of Oregon through government, which works to make legislative decisions and inform the people.  The organization also relies on funding by other independent, charitable foundations, including the Johnson Family Foundation, Circle Foundation, Ford Family Foundation, Oregon Community Foundation, &amp; Meyer Memorial Trust. The donations and assistance from these local foundations help the Oregon Kitchen Table to continue to spread their organization and provide a solid monetary foundation. Oregon’s Kitchen Table makes sure there is a diversity of funders to make sure the results are not geared toward one specific group.As far as funding by citizens go, the website for Oregon’s Kitchen Table lists a section for their general public to take action, and provides a link for anyone to provide a monetary donation as well, making it easy and accessibly for further contributions.  PublicationsThe Oregon's Kitchen Table organization emphasizes itself on being an outlet for voices to be heard, and input to be used and shown as a result. They have done this by publishing their findings for public viewers, as well as for the government and legislators to see. Titled “Oregon’s Kitchen Table – First Consultation Education Outcome Area and Justice System Findings”, the program seeks to encourage deliberation, as well as wanting to show the direct impact its citizens and participants are making in Oregon politics.These publishings are provided for groups and individuals to see the results of those who deliberated with Oregon Kitchen Table. In this first set of published results, which consisted primarily of tallied results from a survey about the local government’s budgeting, Oregon’s Kitchen Table was able to divide these issues into a few sub-categories, which included, education, healthy people, the economy and jobs, and healthy environment issues.The findings consisted of results from 2,790 Oregon residents who participated in the discussion, as well as an additional 423 who took a survey. Overall, the creators took these results, and made a seven page document with information and analysis for those to see. This document had several different pieces of content to help readers decide their opinions on various issues in Oregon, as well as help government legislators view what issues are most important to its constituents. The information in this publication came in a few different forms, and was organized in order for viewers. This included, summaries of the issues at hand, tables that show data from survey questions, quotes from participants, and various sources cited. To see the full results click  here .Oregon’s Kitchen Table has been featured in other news, educational &amp; political sites’ publications as well. Featured in Policyconsensus.org, they state that the goal of this program is to “provide leaders with high-quality feedback on issues that matter to Oregonians”. Despite much coverage on this program, not every publication on Oregon’s Kitchen Table has been positive. According to a large Oregon political blog, the writer vocalizes their opinions on how Oregon’s Kitchen Table doesn’t address the much tougher issues, and shows disappointment with how many important policies were left off of the survey given to citizens.

[6]  In general, the Bertelsmann Stiftung's work is ""grouped into programs, each of which is led by a member of [the] Executive Board.""[7] Projects are grouped by topic and activity, a list of which is available on the foundation's  website . The Board of Trustees, made of individuals interested in the organization's work with ""leadership experience and insight into social progress,"" acts as an advisory and controlling body. [7] In accordance with the articles of incorporation, the Board of Trustees supports the ""foundation’s ongoing development, oversees its executive management and, together with the Executive Board, makes decisions on matters of key importance.""[7]  Bertelsmann Stiftung is a privately operating foundation, so it funds its own philanthropic projects and initiatives via the Bertelsmann Group.[4]  As per Mohn's original conception, the ""foundation works in an interdisciplinary manner with researchers and experts in the field and maintains close contact with public and private institutions,"" striving to strengthen civil society.[2]  As a non-profit foundation, it is overseen by the district government of Detmold and engages in tax-privileged activities exclusively and directly in accordance with the relevant tax regulations.[5]Specializations, Methods and ToolsThe organization's ""objective is to promote research and understanding in the areas of religion, public health, youth and senior affairs, culture and the arts, public education and career training, social welfare, international cultural exchange, democracy and government, and civic engagement.""[8]  With each project, a proposed model or solution is developed, which the organization aims to then implement, with the help of relevant expert knowledge.

764,organization,Partido da Terra (Party of the Earth / Party of the Land),https://participedia.net/organization/764,Description not available.,0,2012-12-26,2017-04-01,2021,jevans,https://participedia.net/user/2021,2021,jevans,https://participedia.net/user/2021,en,,,,,,Spain,40.46366700000001,-3.74922,Non-Profit or Non Governmental,,,,,,,,,,,,,environment, governance,,," Mission and Purpose  The platform of the Partido da Terra encompasses eight types of sovereignty, based on the application of direct democracy at all levels:  citizen sovereignty , which calls for a political reform based on  direct democracy ; territorial sovereignty, where a  localist  administrative reform that builds upon  communalism ,  libertarian municipalism  and  cellular democracy  is proposed; environmental sovereignty, defending a  self-sufficientsustainable living  with the application of  appropriate technology ; food and energy sovereignty, calling both for  food sovereignty  through  local food  consumption and sustainable agriculture ; economic sovereignty, proposing  community-based economics  including some  cooperativist  elements of  distributism  and  green economics ; social sovereignty, introducing a  communitarianethics of care ; cultural sovereignty, emphasizing  Galiza 's Atlantic connections and  bioregionalism ; and linguistic sovereignty, with an explicit support for linguistic  reintegrationism  and closer ties with the  Lusophone  or Portuguese-speaking world. The party also has an advanced platform regarding Peak Oil.  History  The Partido da Terra held its founding meeting in  Santiago de Compostela  on July 25, 2011 and was formally registered in the Spanish Ministry of Interior the same week. The party includes mostly independent members but also incorporated the  Galician Ecologist Movement  (Movimento Ecologista Galego), a registered  green party  founded in 1983 by  Constantino Rábade .  In March 2012 it contested the  Elections to the General Council of the Principality of Asturias , but only in the Western electoral district where the  Galizan -speaking  Eo-Navia  region is located, gaining no seats. In October 2012 it contested the  Galizan Parliamentary Election  obtaining 3,164 votes (0,22%) and ranking as 7th extraparliamentary party out of a total of 26 groups running in the elections.  Introduction to Party Platform  The concept of sovereignty was usurped by the State as an exclusive and absolute attribute, even in the cases where it is alleged that sovereignty resides in or emanates from the people. Today this sovereignty, appropriated by States, linked indissolubly to capitalism -be it State or private-, is used to maximize the flow of production-consumption-taxpaying (with the corresponding consequences in the ecosystems), this payment allowing States or associations of States to increase their power and influence and to compete in the international arena against other State bodies. In order to maximize this flow, State intervention, supporting business corporations, is permanent in the legal, economic and diplomatic fields, both at international and internal level, which lately has become quite obvious because of the amount of public money destined to save the corporations and the financial system from failure through nationalizations, aids, tax breaks and other State activities.  Today the couple State-capitalism programs the whole life of the individual through the promise of welfarism and finishes by eliminating any autonomy and freedom of conscience of persons and communities in which they are inserted.  For this reason, we in the Partido da Terra consider it essential to recover our real sovereignty: our sovereignty to decide as citizens, reclaiming our right of direct deliberation and sovereignty as a means of expressing the political and legal will; our sovereignty to organize politically and administratively our territory and communities, making possible the link between people and land; our sovereignty to exercise responsibility towards the environment in which we are inserted, conserving it and improving it for future generations; our sovereignty to produce the healthy food we need and the clean energy which guarantees our quality of life; our sovereignty to work and exchange fairly the fruits of our effort and determination; our sovereignty to care for our own, for our communities and for ourselves; our sovereignty to be ourselves, cultivating the creative spirit that characterizes us as a people; our sovereignty to express ourselves in the language which is our own, taking our word to all continents.  But sovereignty is nothing without sustainability, without striving for the necessary balance with individual people, with other peoples and with the environment, guaranteeing a framework of community and ecological relations which ensure continuity in time through responsible management and the preservation of our resources. That is why we call for the direct participation of people in political life, taking account of their active responsibility. That is why we defend sustainable ways of life, generalizing the application of proposals of ecological design and appropriate technologies for habitation, transport, productive processes and waste management. That is why we adopt the proposals of food sovereignty, local production and sustainable agriculture launched by the agrarian movement. That is why we call for a new community economy, based on ethical consumption and the autonomy of the worker which allows us to design our own alternatives to the global crisis. That is why we proclaim the ethics of community care which reinforces the links between individuals, families, communities, managing and foreseeing their needs of support and social care. That is why we opt for the logical traditional cultures, for the preservation and cultivation of our heritage and for the linguistic integration in the domain which is natural to us.  The programme proposals which follow are not free from the contradictions inherent in a political project which, defending direct democracy, aims at participating in a system where power is assumed by professional “representatives”. In this scenario, where power is distributed in such unequal way, experience demonstrated that democracy, in its strictest sense, becomes superficial. That is why our proposals are directed to decentralizing power, returning it to people. We appeal for the restructuring of the concept of politics as an active citizens’ practice, emphasizing local power, where direct democracy has its foundation.  However, we don’t give up participating at all levels of the present representative “politics”, trying to inject in the institutions almost an anti-political way (in relation to what today is understood by “doing politics”) of managing governance, public service and decision-making. We want to propose a real paradigm change which restores the essence of democracy, in its only literal and legitimate sense: that of direct democracy.  Nevertheless, it is not our intention to eliminate the existing parliamentary institutions (parliaments and council chambers), but to turn them into tools for confederative management where the delegates from sovereign assemblies may make decisions in the framework of the imperative and revocable mandate, that is where the citizens can assume full responsibility for the management of their problems, developing solutions in a collective way.  We consider that, as the Partido da Terra, we can influence today’s institutions, favouring the establishment of a transition into tomorrow’s institutions, but we don’t intend to control the former or the latter, even because from our point of view the parties, as they are understood today, are not only unnecessary but they are also counterproductive. The principal way of influencing which we aim at exercising from the Partido da Terra is not the control but the diffusion of ideas and practices through example. Our objective not being to take power (nor the benefits and privileges that it accords today to those who detain it) but the mobilization and liberation of energies and creative potential of our communities, of our members, of our society, the proposals here presented are designed for all. The home of the Partido da Terra is made up of our communities.  This programme is not, and does not try to be, comprehensive. Although we care about everything, we don’t claim the primacy of our opinion on any question or particular group of interests. No aspect of life is beyond our preoccupations, but we do not pretend to define everything as political nor to achieve a consensus on everything, be it in the party or in society. We don’t conceive of any linear progression for homogeneity or heterogeneity, but we try to assume and defend the elements of commonalty and diversity which best contribute to the realization of our proposals.  The close reading of this programme will evidence the presence of three internal tendencies which are complementary in the Land Party: one conservative tendency which tries to create the future conditions perpetuating and invigorating the traditional values and practices of our society, which favour the transforming principles here advocated; an innovative tendency which stimulates the adoption of new practices and values; and an integrating tendency designing future alternatives which reconcile the differences between the other two. All the persons making up the Land Party try to contribute to all three tendencies, deciding on and trying consensus solutions according to the concrete problems.  The programme here presented is necessarily a text which is incomplete and a collective (re)creation, which tries to be enriched by the critique, contributions and proposals of civil society, bodies and individuals, beyond the Partido da Terra. We hope that its public presentation is a dynamic and bidirectional process, gathering and adding up multiple perspectives. And, as a non-comprehensive text, the programme will be complemented with specific political documents in which we aim at widening and detailing many of the proposals that are here enumerated briefly, as well as others equally important which lie beyond the dimensions of this programme. We trust in the cooperation of everybody.  Major projects and events Funding  The Party's by-laws explicitly prohibit receiving any kind of governmental subsidy and members elected to office are also prohibited from earning any salary, as the Party defends that politics should be deprofessionalized and based on direct democracy assembly decision-making. Party-members pay no dues and are expected to work localy (at parish and county levels) to disseminate the platform. The Party has no bank account or tax registration and election campaigns are organized at a zero or close-to-zero budget. In the first major elections contested by the Party (October 2012) the total budget was 120 euros, including the distribution of thousands of seeds.Publications  Edições da Terra (Publishing House):  http://www.partidodaterra.net/edicoes-da-terra/O Peteiro (magazine):  http://www.partidodaterra.net/peteiro/(Free PDF download in both cases)  External Links  Website:  http://www.partidodaterra.netFacebook:  http://facebook.com/ptgalizaYoutube:  http://www.youtube.com/user/ptgalizatvNotes ",1,0,0,0,0,

GE-reports is also available as an app and has a connection to administrative ticket systems.Since the beginning of 2015, the city of Mannheim has also had an individualized defect detector from wer | denkt | was GmbH. Citizens&#39; concerns are managed via the 115 service center. External organizations can be granted one-time access to the system for processing a defect report or complaint for the duration of the processing time.  http: //mannheim.mängelmelder.de/The city of Friedrichshafen and the regional council of Bodenseekreis have a common concern portal with “tell it”, which is also connected to the 115 service center. In addition, “tell it” has its own apps. In addition to diverse, individualized categories, a voting function is integrated into the application, with which the concerns expressed by citizens can be assessed.  https://sags-doch.de/bms#pageid=1Reference participatory budgetsThe science city of Darmstadt is carrying out a participatory budget for the sixth time in a row in 2017, which it is continuously developing together with wer | denkt | was GmbH. A special feature here is the close integration of analog and digital participation options and the provision of content in easy language.  https://da-bei.darmstadt.de/In Monheim am Rhein, citizens have been able to participate annually in the preparation of the municipal household online since 2012. In particular, the investments and highlights that the city will discontinue are the subject of lively discussion.  https://www.monheim.de/index.php?id=5301Reference card-based participationWith the help of crowd mapping, the asparagus city of Lampertheim integrates its citizens into the planned urban redevelopment on the “Sag&#39;s doch mol” platform. On an interactive map on which the area to be designed is highlighted, suggestions and suggestions can be noted using a marker. Crowdmapping is the first part of a process that will take several months to transform the inner city in an attractive way.  https://sags-doch-mol.de/page/stadtumbauIn the spring of 2016, the city of Friedrichshafen gave residents the opportunity to submit contributions to the “Noise Action Plan Level 2” on its “say it” platform via a card-based online participation. During the participation phase, users could select a location on the map and participate with their contributions, indicating the source of the interference, the type of noise and the desired measures. The determined noise values for different types of noise for day and night can be shown and hidden on the map to provide citizens with information.  https://sags-doch.de/discuss/lapReference project listSince the beginning of 2017, the city of Konstanz has been supplementing its public participation offer with a list of projects. Project profiles compiled by the city as well as the respective possibility of online participations are arranged according to city districts.  http://konstanz-mitgestalten.de/topic/vorhabenlisteSince 2015, the science city of Darmstadt has been informing its citizens with a list of projects about planning and projects in the city. Here, projects are integrated in which your participation can be carried out. The list of projects implements a crucial point of the jointly developed &quot;Guidelines for Citizen Participation&quot;.  https://da-bei.darmstadt.de/topic/vorhabenlisteReference citizen surveyA change of timetable in the summer of 2016 caused controversial discussions in the city of Pfungstadt. The city took the concerns and complaints of its citizens seriously and launched an online citizens&#39; survey on the use of public transport. In addition to frequently used routes and general usage habits, the survey also gave the opportunity to express wishes in the design of public transport.  http://buergerbeteiligung.pfungstadt.de/Wer | denkt | was GmbH asked the citizens about their general satisfaction and interests on paper as well as online on behalf of the asparagus town of Lampertheim. There were social, political and economic focal points. The representative citizen panel started with the survey in 2015, so that in future the survey should be repeated every two to three years.  https://sags-doch-mol.de/page/buergerbefragung2015At the start of the Integrated Urban Development Concept (ISEK) of the City of Friedrichshafen, citizens were able to participate in an online survey on the platform &quot;tell it&quot;. The main topics were, for example, quality of life and living in Friedrichshafen. The citizens&#39; survey forms the basis for the development of an ISEK for the next 15 years.  https://sags-doch.de/discuss/isekBest practice example: Darmstadt community budgetSince 2012, the city of science Darmstadt has been carrying out its community budget with wer | denkt | was GmbH in close cooperation. The procedure has been evaluated several times and optimized in cooperation with citizens. Wer | denkt | was GmbH conceives the procedure together with the city ombudsman and takes over the technical implementation, the moderation as well as the process support and advice. In 2016, the participatory budget was carried out for the fifth time. A focus was placed on the districts and quarters as an immediate everyday and living space, in that all ideas and suggestions were assigned to the respective districts and were accessible via a district map. Another focus was on the various options for submitting ideas on site and coordinating existing suggestions. For example, the top 3 ideas for each district and for the city as a whole were determined separately in an online and offline vote. All Top3 ideas were literally mapped in their own magistrate templates and politically advised.As in previous years, information on the individual product areas and the procedure as well as the budget was provided on the citizen participation  portal of  the city of science Darmstadt (  www.da-bei.darmstadt.de  ). A flyer, the press and advertisements on buses and trains were used to draw attention to the participatory budget. As every year, the open household implemented by wer | denkt | was GmbH provided a very convenient and quick introduction to the topic.Best practice example: Friedrichshafen noise action planNoise action plans are generally used to regulate noise effects and problems, they define goals, strategies and measures to reduce noise pollution. However, the subjective noise perception of those affected often deviates from the measured or statistically determined noise levels. Therefore, the city of Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance decided to involve its citizens directly in its noise action plan level 2 and to have a say - so that not only the determined parameters, but also the people spoke.The active involvement of the citizens via an interactive mapping of the noise  action plan  level 2 took place on the online platform “say it” (  www.sags-doch.de  ). At the center of the participation process was an interactive map that provided information and planned measures for individual noise points, but also made contributions and comments possible. Various noise maps (day / night, rail noise / street noise) could be shown there. By clicking on an affected area, the measures already implemented and planned were displayed. During the participation phase from February 26 to March 31, 2016, users were able to select a location on the map and participate with their contributions, indicating the source of the interference, the type of noise and the desired measures. Posts already published were visible to all visitors to the platform and could also be commented on.In addition to the participation on the map, users were also able to post in the forum “Seen elsewhere: best practice” - a way of presenting good ideas from other municipalities and countries that might also be conceivable in Friedrichshafen to reduce noise. The second forum offered space for &quot;praise and criticism&quot; with the aim of collecting suggestions for improvements to the platform and the process.Another special feature of the procedure was that contributions received by letter, e-mail, telephone or via the general citizen information system “say it” were integrated into the platform. Citizens who are not active online were also able to participate.  ",1,0,0,0,0,

The integration of the country in the EU negotiations and the inability of successive governments of the Republic caused a systematic wastage of natural resources and disposal of agricultural, industrial and fishing. The impregnation of private interests in state organs and entities influenced by the government, has been a dominant and rule breaking in nuclear policies of our collective life a costly practice and generating costs increasingly unbearable for the citizens in taxes and administrative fees on access to services public. This indifference has resulted in increasingly high level of abstention, which culminated in the election of 2011 the President with the overcoming of the number of abstentions on the number of voters, with this clearance, we citizens, we have been facilitating the opacity in accountability, which is installed between the heads of state organs. The requirement for reversing these trends, compounded with the policies articulated with the troika representing the international creditors of the adjustment program, had in September 15, 2012 a massive demonstration of people angry and willing to say ""enough"" to the madness that settled . The urgent resumption of hope in the future people progressively better, expose them firstly to all kinds of demagogic promises that politicians have used in professional and calls for a collective response at the local, regional, national and EU level. The role of political parties in a democratic society can not kidnap citizens' participation in public life in favor of a closed partidocracia itself and blind and deaf to the aspirations of citizens. For all these reasons, the Motion + D intends to fight for the mobilization and organization of citizens based on the number of program lines and act in a manner consistent with the principles and policy instruments specified in this Charter Founder. The Movement + D incorporates in its aims and objectives and the moralization of political regeneration and the scheme constituted on 25 April 1974, by valuing all practices of mobilization and intervention in public life of citizens, on the assumption that "" the State is all of us.

Jefferson Action is the 501(c)(4) partner of  the Jefferson Center.Origins and DevelopmentIn 1974, Minneapolis native Ned Crosby founded a think tank called  the Jefferson Center for New Democratic Processes,  Jefferson Action's partner organization. Named in honor of Thomas Jefferson, who believed that the American people are the ultimate source of power in our democracy – and that they will make the right decisions if they’re educated on the issues.

Help uscomplete this section!Specializations, Methods and ToolsUsing the  Citizens Jury method , Jefferson Action holds Citizen Election Forums to develop specific policy recommendations and ensure that politicians and candidates respond the important issues their constituents have identified.Major Projects and EventsIn 2012, Jefferson Action embarked on an ambitious project to influence the conversation in a hotly contested congressional race. The project, named Reclaim November, used the Citizen Election Forum to evaluate Congressional candidates in Northeast Ohio.[1] Due to redistricting, two incumbent members of Congress were pitted against each other in Ohio's 16th Congressional District, Betty Sutton (D) and Jim Renacci (R).  Jefferson Action partnered with community groups, the media and academic institutions to hold three Citizen Election Forums in Ohio's 16th Congressional District. Each forum brought together 24 citizens randomly selected from the district assuring a demographically representative sample. These citizens studied the complexities of the economic issues facing the people of Ohio and evaluated the candidates responsiveness to addressing those issues.  Both Jim Renacci and Betty Sutton agreed to participate in the forum. After spending more than an hour talking to each of the candidates, the Forum participants issued an evaluation of the solutions the Representatives presented on the economic issue troubling Northeast Ohio.  The project received significant media attention, with more than 80 news stories in four months, including a dozen front page articles in the districts two most influential papers. The Reclaim November Ohio project also had a significant impact on the vote. Internal polling done by Jefferson Action showed that as much as 2.5 percent of voters reported the project influenced their vote. Jim Renacci, the winner of the election had a 4.2 percent margin of victory.  Jefferson Action approached Tina Nabatchi of Syracuse University to do an independent evaluation of the Reclaim November Project. She found the project excelled in a number of areas including overall participant satisfaction--both in terms of the overall outcome and the fair, unbiased way in which the project was conducted. Additionally, Dr. Nabatchi found that participants in the project had increased knowledge of the issues and on trust with government.Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

The nation state is no longer the appropriate political form in which to define democratic decision-making and active citizenship, equality between people, the respect and extension of rights. The nation state is not the appropriate political form to promote a responsible politics for the environment, ensure political control over the economy and an equitable distribution of wealth, or promote peace between people. European Alternatives seeks to promote alternative forms of political subjectivity and collective political action.  European Alternatives believes that social and political change requires artistic and cultural engagement as much as other forms of engagement: social and political change being understood by the organisation as a complete renewal of society which is not limited to any one domain or sector.  European Alternatives does not believe that Europe can be defined in geographical or ethnic terms, neither by borders nor roots. Europe must be understood as a space of exchange, of experimentation and of dialogue.  History  The organisation was officially born in 2007 in London and started with the organisation of the London Festival of Europe, bringing to London a series of free public events and artistic happenings promoting imaginative thinking about Europe’s future and its relation to the rest of the world, to mark the 50th anniversary of the  Treaties of Rome . The Festival became transnational and took the name the Transeuropa Festival in 2009 ( www.transeuropafestival.eu ). It was organised in 2010 in London, Paris, Rome and Cluj-Napoca (Romania), where offices were opened. Local groups of volunteers were created by members in about 15 cities in Europe. The Transeuropa Festival was then organised in 12 cities in 2011 and in 15 in 2012. The organisation worked on other projects, such as campaigns, film, European Citizens' Initiatives, transnational projetcts led by local groups on topics such as migrants' rights, Roma rights, LGBT rights, basic income, common goods.  Organizational Structure and Funding  European Alternatives has offices in London, Paris, Rome, Cluj-Napoca and has members in 15+ countries. Most projects are funded by the European Commission (Europe for Citizens, Youth in Action, EACEA), as well as by private funders (Allianz, Mercator...).  European Alternatives was awarded the Charlemagne Prize by the European Parliament for The London Festival of Europe, a civil society prize from the EESC for Transeuropa festival and a prize from the German Federal Agency for Civic Education.

We enable you to interact with large target audience, crowdsource the data analysis and improve your performance. Our solution is effectively integrated in governments, local authorities, conferences and enterprises. It already changed decisions.  Insights was founded in 2009. It was built on the experience accumulated by its founders and partners from a wide variety of places: government offices, local authorities, business entities, civil society, academia, and technology companies. For about six months we dealt with the development of operating procedures with the assistance of 15 partners with extensive experience in the field.Our PlatformOur platform enables decision makers to communicate and consult with large groups easily. Currently there are dozens of tools used for managing collaboration ranging from forums, virtual votes, feedback forms to electronic surveys. Unfortunately, these tools are very limited in their ability to formulate relevant insights to questions presented during consultations. They also fail to give participants an attractive and interactive experience, with authentic feedback. Insights proposes an alternative:Qualitative Analysis  – by integrating our ""crowd-sourcing 2.0"" method, our web-based platform analyzes answers to open questions to reflect knowledge and not mere preferences.Personalized Feedback  - for the first time, we integrate decisions into the consultation process and offer personalized and immediate feedback to each participant.Multi-Channel Collection  - our communication interface collects answers and communicates through various sources - text messages, emails, web, meetings, conferences etc.Bridging Gaps  - by constantly forming virtual panel groups, our social website creates a tangible and continous connection between decision makers and stakeholders.Crowd Wisdom  - our web-based platform integrates all components of James Surowiecki's novel book: diversity, independence, decentralization and aggregation.Our technology embraces creative solutions to problems encountered by government and business entities. It ensures that every idea and contribution will be reviewed properly and promotes long-term commitment and interaction with your entire target audience which brings value to decisions.Our CustomersOur technology is already in use by several ministries, municipaities, organisations and conferneces in Israel, among them the  Ministry of Finance , the  Ministry of Environment , the  Ministry of Trade &amp; Labour , the Municipality of Tel Aviv-Jaffa , the  Municipality of Kfar Saba ,  Appleseeds Academy ,  TheMarker  and other organisations. Here are some numbers to describe its outreach and success:More than 500 stakeholders took part in devising Israel Green Growth's policy.  The new policy addresses all key insights from the consultations . The consultation website includes hundreds of contributions made directly on the web or typed in the 9 roundtables we operated.The Mayor of Kfar Saba  adopted 90 per cent of the 10 insights  summarized his consultation on the city's leisure policy. The outreach was significant - any fifth citizen was offered to take part during events or through phone calls and text messages. Overall, 1,500 out of 20,000 participated.Tel Aviv Municipality changed its focus following a wide consultation on its youth community center. Around 10,000 were exposed to the process, out of which 1,100 participated  through facebook, meetings and our special landing page. Most insights were adopted.  During ""Israel 2021"" conference, led by TheMarker, a leading newspaper in Israel,  around 400 participants answered the conference's question  on how to lead change in Israel. Their insights were processed and published. Half of all the pariticipants entered the website.Our Founding PrinciplesInsights' success is measured by our impact on decision-making and our ability to turn participants into partners. Aside of our outcome indicators, there are several founding principles guiding us: We are relentlessly focused on outcomes, not processes. Consultation is a tool for leading effective and lasting change. Turning it into a ""normative"" obligation will only hinder its purpose. We trust decision makers. Our platform seeks to strengthen their capacity to make better decisions, interact wisely with large groups of stakeholders and raise their legitimacy. We believe in integrating ""content"" with ""process"" capacity. Running a decision-making process is a profession. , but it cannot be detached from expertise in the field itslef. We perceive every participant as a costumer. Those who are willing to contribute their time for consultations must be heard and get an update on their impact. We work hard to make policy accessible and comprehensible. In order for collaborative decision making procedures to succeed, stakeholders must understand them ",1,0,0,0,0,

It was originally submitted by  Jeffrey Abelson .""Song Of A Citizen"" is a non-profit, non-partisan collaboration of prominent thinkers and artists seeking to shine a bright spotlight on what we feel is the true root cause of our increasingly dysfunctional democracy -- the alarmingly low levels of civic and political literacy and sustained engagement by the average citizen in America. Our debut effort is an innovative series of Video Op-Eds for the internet featuring an array of nationally renowned political philosophers, authors, poets, journalists, historians, civic engagement experts, and deliberative democracy leaders -- each offering a different take on what it really means to be an engaged and effective citizen in modern times -- how we-the-people are measuring up -- how we can do better -- and why we must.  Project Description  Structure and Process  An ever expanding array of thinkers and artists brainstorm ways of communicating this critical message that politicians and pundits rarely discuss in public. Project initiator Abelson then refines the ideas, develops a creative approach, and works with participants to fashion their individual videos. Once complete, Song Of A Citizen engages with various civic engagement and other organizations to leverage all tools of social media to spread the word and generate awareness of the videos.  Impact  The solution can be found only in hearts and minds of ordinary citizens. It will take a decade or more to measure progress in that mysterious domain. Song Of A Citizen has no interest in directly impacting policy or political decisions. It exists solely to motivate citizens to acknowledge that that is their job, and provide tools and encouragement to help them get on with it.  Detailed Information Broader Context Not ""was"" but ""is"" and will be -- part of a series of Deliberative Democracy projects sponsored by major deliberation organizations -- which are organized for the express purpose of empowering citizens to generate a consensus about various policies, and turn their talk into action at the policy level.

It helps to builds the administrative capacity of local governments and to strengthen channels of communication between national and sub-national bodies to further devolve power to the local level, ultimately aiming to improve the quality of life for Tanzanians.[1]Origins and DevelopmentThe Ministry of Regional Administration and Local Government (MRLAG) was established by Article 8 (1) 145 and 146 in the 1977 Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania. In 1982, the Parliament of the United Republic of Tanzania passed the Local Government No 7 (Cap 287) Act and the City Authorities Act No. 8 (Cap 288), giving the Minister dealing with regional and local government authority over the establishment of District, Village, Minor, and Local Authorities. In 1990, the Ministry was renamed ""The Local Government Ministry, Social Development, Cooperation and Marketing."" In 1998, the work of the Ministry was transferred to the Prime Minister's office, renamed the Ministry for Regional and Local Governance (MRLG), and its work divided amongst two departments, one each for Regional and Local Government. In November 2000, the MRALG's work was transferred to the Presidential Office, becoming the PORALG. Five years later in December 2005, the Ministry was transferred back to the Prime Minister's Office before returning to the Office of the President in 2015.[2]Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingSince 2015, PO-RALG has been headed by a Minister, to whom the Permanent Secretary reports. Its various divisions focus on administration and human resources; government communication; procurement management; policy and planning; and finance and accounts, a unit headed by a chief accountant. [3] Finally, there is a chief internal auditor responsible for internal affairs.

Mmari, Permanent Secretary of PO-RALG in 2005, argued that “local communities once empowered, have shown themselves capable of managing and accounting for funds disbursed to schools,” which seems to suggest some positive impacts of the organization’s decentralization efforts.[9] As a result of the PO-RALG’s education management initiatives, school fees for primary education were reduced, enrolment rate increased by over 30% from 2000 to 2004, and gender parity increased.[9] However, at the time of writing in 2005, Mwesiga also recognized the remaining work to be done to “sustain the successes.”[9]Similarly, Suleiman Ngware positively evaluated the Local Government Reform Programme implemented by PO-RALG, highlighting its successes while acknowledging the complexities of its goals of democratization, empowerment, and improved service delivery.[10] Ngware highlighted the impact on neighbouring nations as well, noting that delegations from Malawi, Zambia, Uganda, Kenya, and Nigeria have sent delegations to view the reform implementation and subsequently borrowed from its programme.[10]PublicationsDoes this organization publish reports, studies, or other media?

It is about crowd sourcing legislation, deliberative and participatory democracy and citizens initiatives. It is a non-profit organization based in Helsinki, Finland. It helps citizens and NGO's with national citizens' initiatives, EU citizens initiatives and develops the online services for collaborating, sharing and signing the initiatives. In March 2012 the Finnish Parliament passed the Citizens’ Initiative Act. The Act allows any citizen to present a law to Parliament, providing they can get the support of 50,000 citizens. If a proposal gains more than 50.000 signatures within six months, then the Parliament is obliged to discuss and vote on the initiative. However, there was no ministry to accompany the Citizens Initiative i.e. no one to help citizens to weigh options or draft the text for proposals. The Open Ministry tries to fill this gap and to help people make laws. The site allows Finns to submit proposals for legislation, which are then debated and refined by the site’s membership. The Open Ministry doesn’t have opinions as an institution. The Open Ministry doesn’t present any ideas or have any opinions itself. Issues dealt with have included: copyright, gender-neutral marriage, bullying in schools, open data, one official language.  http://openministry.info/http://avoinministerio.fi  ",1,0,0,0,0,

Activities of the INM are rooted in the core concepts of social justice and inclusion, respect for democratic values and the principles of sustainable development, in a spirit of open-mindedness and innovation. In its activities, the INM adopts a structured, deliberative three-pronged approach to contemporary issues: making needed information available, fostering informed  debate  and bringing forward proposals for positions or action.Origins and DevelopmentThe Institute was established in 2003 by a group of academics and figures from civil society brought together by Michel Venne, then (1990 to 2006) a journalist at the Montréal French-language newspaper, Le Devoir. The founders of the Institute believed that there was a crucial need for an institution that could effectively inform public debate and promote citizen participation on issues relating to the place, the role and the needs of a small nation like Québec in a globalized world.  The “New World” is first and foremost the Americas, the physical territory of which Québec is part. The expression also evokes the idea of world renewal, as exemplified by the spirit of explorers and discoverers. Another of the goals of the INM is precisely that: to explore and open up new horizons and celebrate successes, but also to look long and hard at the shortcomings, failures and needs of Québec society, relative to the rest of the world. The INM’s work is based on the firm conviction that the renewal of ideas entails citizen participation, because the introduction of new ideas cannot be the sole prerogative of experts or interest groups.Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingKnow how this organization operates internally? Help uscomplete this section!Specializations, Methods and ToolsActivities of the INM centre around three key themes.Key Theme 1: Development of Citizenship SkillsThe INM works to foster “citizenship attitudes” and contribute to the development of citizenship skills for individuals and organizations. It develops transferable expertise, conducts ongoing monitoring of citizen participation and organizes activities designed to  educate , train and mobilize individual Quebeckers or support their involvement in community action, in particular through its annual Summer and Winter Schools for young people between the ages of 15 and 35. The Institute runs information campaigns and takes public stands on questions of participation and democracy. In addition, through its consultancy service (INM services-conseil), it also provides services to help organizations, businesses and institutions establish quality “participatory spaces”. The Institute’s organizational services are based on the best collaborative practice models known.Key Theme 2: Promotion of ongoing debate on key issues for Québec societyThe INM advocates ongoing debate on key issues for Québec society. One illustration of this position is its creation of an open and easily accessible Agora or citizen think-tank. Quebeckers learn about participation by personally engaging in discussions on important public issues, knowing that the results of those discussions can potentially influence public policy or private initiatives. And the more they participate, the more they want to pursue their participation.  The Agora has five basic components:Ongoing observation of the evolution of Québec society and identification of issues that call for debate (in particular, through an advisory panel of publicly respected figures and publication annually of the almanac: L’état du Québec (meaning: The State of Québec – not available in translation), an annual overview of Québec society;  Information-gathering and, where relevant, production and dissemination of the information people need to participate in informed debate on current issues (preparation of theme-based kits on subjects such as health, the economy, culture, demography, mining development);  Organization of deliberative democracy activities ranging from simple  round-table discussions  to structured exchanges over a period of several months, known as Strategic Rendez-Vous;Dynamic  and engaged facilitation of a web-based forum for discussion;  Active promotion of the ideas, projects and proposals arising from the discussions and debates it initiates, by communicating them to the general public and to policy-makers and by encouraging further reflection on outcomes (using instruments such as reports, reviews, publications, declarations, etc.).Key Theme 3: Promotion of citizen participation, an essential component in the exercise and development of democratic rightsThe INM conducts a range of structured reflection and promotion activities on issues relating to democracy and citizen participation. It collects and makes available information on the current state of knowledge on democracy and citizen participation. It brings together diverse  stakeholders  for discussions on public participation, consultation mechanisms and the relationship between participatory and representative democracy. It engages in public debate on the way institutions are evolving and on the exercise of democratic rights, prepares advisory briefs and may, on occasion, take positions on questions of public policy, private sector initiatives, or current issues or events involving citizen participation, the way democratic institutions function, or the organization of participatory processes. The Institute also promotes citizen participation through its involvement in national or international issue tables or coalitions of relevance to its mission, and through its public presence and as part of a communications strategy that uses both traditional news media and  social media  to reach different target networks.Major Projects and EventsKey Theme 1: Skills development for individual citizens and for organizationsWorking with individual citizensCitizenship Schools: Summer and Winter SchoolsSince 2004, the INM has offered Summer Schools on Citizenship to young people between the ages of 15 and 35. Over a five-day period, they can hear presentations and participate in round table discussions, seminars and  workshops , all designed to enhance their knowledge or understanding of the major issues of our times and help augment their citizenship skills.  In a convivial and relaxed atmosphere, some five to seven hundred participants discuss current issues and define the kind of world they want to live in.  In winter, Québec college students between the ages of 17 and 20 can attend the Winter School that the INM has now organized since 2007.  Further information is available (in French only) at  http://www.inm.qc.ca/programmes/ecole-deteÀ go, on change le monde! – Social EntrepreneurshipSince 2007, in association with the Caisse d’économie solidaire Desjardins, the INM has supported and promoted social entrepreneurship projects undertaken by young Quebeckers. Social entrepreneurs are people who propose practical and innovative solutions in response to social issues and who apply entrepreneurial principles in the creation and management of projects with pronounced social impacts, while ensuring community involvement in the process.  The program, À go, on change le monde! offers young social entrepreneurs a range of different forms of support: access to information or advice, financial assistance, references to professional services, a mentoring network and a young social entrepreneurs’ club.  A further goal of the program is the development of increased public awareness of the role played by young social entrepreneurs in Québec.  Further information is available (in French only) at:  http://www.agoonchangelemonde.qc.ca/Working with organizations : INM services-conseilThe Institut du Nouveau Monde provides four kinds of services to organizations: process support, facilitation of consultations or events, training workshops and lectures or presentations.Process supportINM’s consultancy service can provide needed support to organizations looking for significant results around a variety of processes: carrying out consultations involving citizen participation, establishing innovative internal working groups, organizing an event designed to provoke reflection and identify priorities, or wanting guidance around a forecasting and strategic planning process. INM services-conseil can play a facilitation role for a process already under way or help plan the different steps needed for a given project.Group facilitationEffective facilitation happens when the serious goal of having a group jointly come to meaningful conclusions is achieved through the use of a relaxed and fun-filled approach. INM services-conseil offers added-value service in that it can suggest the use of less familiar discussion methods which nonetheless produce tangible results: open forums,  café conversations , 4-6 huddles, buzz sessions, the scenario technique, etc. In addition, the service works with a range of innovative and creative approaches such as social intervention theatre, street animation and video screenings to highlight particular issues, while also using more traditional facilitation methods, where appropriate.Training workshopsDue to its expertise and use of participatory activities such as role-playing, experience-based approaches, round tables and situation simulation techniques, the INM has come to be recognized as a leader in its field. For questions on how best to communicate publicly, craft powerful messages or generate creative ideas, for looking more deeply into issues such as participatory local governance or any other issue relevant to the INM’s mission, the consultancy team can propose innovative approaches that will help participants better understand and retain the information they have been given.Lectures or presentationsINM services-conseil has speakers available for lectures or presentations in a variety of different formats to explain the results of the Institute’s reflections and practices on the question of citizen participation. Alternatively, it can also draw on outside resources if a client organization would prefer to hear a range of points of view on a topic, give participants the opportunity to form their own potentially opposing opinions, and so spark debate on a subject.  Further information on INM services-conseil is available (in French only) at:  http://www.inm.qc.ca/services-conseilExamples of projects undertaken for outside organizationsCitizens’ juryAt the request of the Director General of Elections for Québec (DGEQ), the Institut du Nouveau Monde organized in January 2010 a citizens’ jury on the issue of the funding of political parties by private firms or other groups. Members of the jury first attended hearings where expert witnesses presented a range of background information on the topic, then deliberated together before submitting their advice to the DGEQ.  Further information is available (in French only) at:  http://www.inm.qc.ca/jury-citoyen.htmlTout le monde à tableStaff and the travelling nutritionist from the Tout le monde à Table convoy travelled around the 17 regions in Québec to meet with a range of Québec families in different parts of the province. They wanted to get input from parents of children between 0 and 12 on issues around food and eating, such as the pleasures of eating well, eating together as a family and meal preparation. The information collected from the parents has been used by public health workers, elected policy-makers, the food industry and consumer groups to support the development of effective strategies for healthy eating.  Further information is available (in French only) at:  http://www.toutlemondeatable.org/Agenda 21 for CultureThe development of Québec’s Agenda 21 for Culture was the responsibility of the province’s then Ministère de la Culture, des Communications et de la Condition féminine. Québec’s Agenda 21 for Culture is a 21-point framework for action designed to spur a renewed vision of cultural development. Through its organization of corresponding public events and management of the project website, the Institute played a leadership role in the development of a comprehensive dialogue around the topic, as well as providing input for the final version of the document.  Further information is available at:  http://www.agenda21c.gouv.qc.ca/Province-wide citizen forums for the Bouchard-Taylor CommissionTwo respected Québec intellectuals and specialists in cultural diversity, Doctors Gérard Bouchard and Charles Taylor, were appointed in 2008 to head this historic Commission.  The two co-presidents commissioned the Institut du Nouveau Monde to organize four province-wide citizen consultation forums. Based on its expertise in organizing structured opportunities for productive citizen debate, the INM recommended the use of interactive events on different themes around cultural differences and the concept of “reasonable accommodation”, as a way to encourage all Quebeckers to voice their opinions on the key issues involved.Key Theme 2: Promotion of ongoing public debatePublicationsL’état du Québec:  Aimed at a general (non-specialist) readership, it provides a comprehensive portrait of Québec’s political, economic, cultural and social situation for the current year, together with the most recently available statistics.Dynamic organization of broad-based consultation and debateStrategic Rendez-Vous ForumsThe purpose of the INM’s Strategic Rendez-Vous forums is to encourage open and informed debate between experts and members of the community, so as to map out a shared vision of the Québec they want and the kind of world they want to be in, twenty years from now.  The Institute uses a three-pronged approach: making needed information available, fostering informed debate and bringing forward proposals for positions or actions.  A steering committee of experts in the field proposes the questions to be debated and identifies relevant and easily understandable documentation. In each of the regions of Québec, community members are invited to take part in the debate on the issues identified. They meet again at the end of the process to finalize orientations and adopt proposals for concrete action. Outcomes from each of the Strategic Rendez-Vous forums take the form of recommendations communicated to the public and presented to both stakeholders and authorities in the community concerned. Strategic Rendez-Vous forums have so far been organized around topics ranging from the economy and health to culture and intergenerational issues.  Further (French only) information on the two topics currently being debated (the first, social inequalities, and the second, democracy and citizen participation) can be found (in French only) at:  http://www.inm.qc.ca/inegalites/presentation  and at  http://www.inm.qc.ca/democratie/presentationPublic conversations on the future of mining in QuébecThe Institute’s Public Conversations on the Future of Mining in Québec were held to objectively and impartially identify for the general public the main issues arising from the exploration and extraction of mineral resources in Québec, in addition to providing an open forum where citizens and community stakeholders could raise questions, express their concerns and, most importantly, explore potential solutions.  In this way, the INM gives Québec citizens, organizations concerned about these issues and public policy-makers the opportunity to obtain information within an objective framework and engage in open-minded debate with others on the issue.  Further information (French only) is available at:  http://www.inm.qc.ca/avenir-minierThe Future of Higher EducationQuébec witnessed unusually high levels of mobilization and unrest in Spring 2011. The provincial government subsequently acknowledged the need to re-establish a climate for dialogue by organizing a Summit on Higher Education.  In keeping with the spirit of the pre-Summit process, the INM invited Québec citizens to join the collective reflection process. A total of four forums were held to allow Quebeckers of all ages and backgrounds to give their views about what higher education in Québec should be in the 21st century. A summary of the discussions in these forums was presented in a report to the Minister of Higher Education, in advance of the Summit.  To the same end, a special Summit-focused Winter School was held for Quebeckers between the ages of 15 and 35.  Further information (French only) is available at:  http://www.inm.qc.ca/enseignement-superieur/presentationKey Theme 3: Promotion of citizen participation, an essential component in the exercise and development of democratic rightsThe following are some examples of the approaches used to support INM's different activities.Social Innovation Laboratory - LABISLABIS is a process designed to encourage social innovation in response to complex social problems. It is organized in several stages and brings together stakeholders or citizens who embark on a collective reflection about issues to be addressed, using a deliberative approach that allows for complexity, creativity and diverging views of the future. The group first considers people’s different personal perceptions and realities, then jointly develops a comprehensive vision on which to base target strategies and innovative projects.  Further information is available at:http://inm.qc.ca/nos-activites/labis-laboratoire-dinnovation-sociale.htmlOpen ForumThis approach allows participants in an event to design their own personal participation plans. Free of time constraints, and coming and going as they please, they develop personalized schedules, propose topics, and become involved in discussions of interest to them. The activity evolves in parallel with the rhythm of the resulting discussion circles, whose members are constantly changing. The goal of the experience is for participants to imagine innovative solutions to problems faced by their organizations, and allow them to see these problems differently as a result of the Open Forum approach.Scenario TechniqueThe Scenario Technique is a local deliberative forum that brings together representatives of a range of different groups (political decision makers, private-sector representatives, technical experts, resident citizens, etc.), all of whom have some degree of expertise in their respective communities. This mixed group is divided into teams which identify positive and negative scenarios for given future situations. Participants reflect on the difficulties encountered, draw up their own scenarios, then together design a local plan of action.4-6 HuddlesA 4-6 Huddle is a perception and information sharing technique aimed at clarifying an issue in a context conducive to in-depth  deliberation  and debate. The method was developed as an ice-breaking activity for group events and takes the form of rounds of four to six huddles formed by four to six participants who change with every round.Café ConversationsCafé Conversations provide opportunities for exchange, debate and dialogue among different people concerned or affected by particular issues. Working in groups of four to eight, people take part in rounds of discussion on one or several topics. The groups work simultaneously in the same room but participants change tables after each round, so as to spread ideas and extend discussion. The event ends with a plenary session, where the main ideas and conclusions developed in the discussions are presented to all participants.Citizen CaravansCitizen Caravans are a “street happening” technique used to stimulate reflection on current issues among people of all backgrounds and ages. Activities are playful, lively, and short-lasting. They are held in public spaces, such as streets, shopping centres or festivals, etc. where people can freely come and go. They are designed to appeal to children, teenagers and adults alike.  The Caravans are results-based activities developed as an improved tool for taking the pulse of citizens on a range of topics. Street events are performed by actors equipped with portable suitcases stocked with a vast array of stimulating and amusing props developed by the INM.Buzz SessionsEach Buzz Session brings together small groups of people who, within a short period of time, must complete a task focusing on a particular problem. The tight deadline creates a sense of urgency that drives the group to propose ideas “in the rough” which, while not fully developed, nevertheless contribute to exploration of the subject under consideration.Panels orCitizens’ JuriesA citizens’ jury is a group of twenty or so randomly selected people who can contribute to the political decision-making process. Participants are asked to examine and debate an important public policy issue. By the final stage of the process, the group is expected to be able to come to a collective decision on the subject.  Citizens’ juries are often established when decision-makers feel trapped in the gridlock created by strongly divided public opinion and conflicting interests. To start with, needed background information is presented to the jury, which first debates the issue, then formulates recommendations that can be drawn on by policy-makers in the decisions they will later take.Analysis and Lessons LearnedThe work carried out by the Institute has led to an increase in citizen participation in the democratic life of Québec. The organization is strongly committed to the broad dissemination of information on issues of importance for Québec, to advocating ongoing public debate on these issues and to promoting the ideas and projects resulting from that debate in the public arena and among decision-makers.  By increasing citizen participation, the INM has helped transform the political culture of Québec, as well as legitimizing and showing the value of this kind of participation. At the same time, it is developing and applying new approaches, building up a wealth of transferable knowledge and creating models for dialogue and participation that can be drawn on to change the behaviours of opinion-leaders in Québec society and reform existing democratic institutions. The INM has led Quebeckers to develop a taste for democratic activism.  Some results of the INM’s work: in numbers and in public recognition:  Through its various activities, the INM now reaches more than 20,000 people every year. Some 15,000 receive the Institute’s newsletter and 350 people are registered members of the organization.  Since 2004, around 5,000 young people have participated in citizenship education activities in the context of the INM’s Summer and Winter Schools. Over a five-day period, they interact around presentations, round table discussions, seminars and workshops. The entire process is designed to help them increase their knowledge and understanding of the major issues of our time, while also learning civic skills. The INM’s Summer School was recognized in 2008 as a key component in Québec’s Youth Action Strategy, for a period of five years. Furthermore, in 2010, the Summer School received one of three prizes awarded by the Institute for Canadian Citizenship, for its outstanding civic education practices. Lastly, in 2011, the same Summer School was identified as one of the ten most innovative and promising projects among the 300 projects supported by the Montréal Island Youth Forum.  Since 2007, as part of the program À go, on change le monde!, more than 900 young entrepreneurs have been able to receive information, advice, financial assistance and references to professional services, call on a network of mentors and join a young social entrepreneurs’ club.  Since 2004, over 12,000 people have participated in citizen forums organized as part of the Strategic Rendez-Vous program.  In 2007, the Executive Director of the Institute was appointed by the Government of Québec to the position of Vice Chair of the Working Group on the Québec Health System, an appointment stemming from the work carried out by the INM in 2005 on the reform of the Québec health system. The results of the Institute’s analyses and consultations were presented to the World Health Organization (WHO) which subsequently drew upon the INM’s expertise for work the WHO carried out in collaboration with the Ministries of Health of Portugal and Tunisia.  Since 2006, the INM has worked closely with ACFAS (Association francophone pour le savoir, a French-language multidisciplinary learned society), to support its organization of conferences for exchanges and the advancement of research on the theme of citizen participation. Over this period, more than 250 researchers and practitioners have met and discussed their work and approaches to it.  In 2005, the INM was awarded the Claire Bonenfant Prize for Citizenship, an honour bestowed by the Government of Québec in recognition of the promotion of democratic values and citizenship education.  Since the Institute’s creation in 2003, its influence has increasingly come to be recognized outside Québec as well as within the province. One example of this recognition was the fact that, in the three years between 2010 and 2012, the INM was responsible for organizing the World Assembly of Civicus, the Global Alliance for Citizen Participation, an annual forum attended by some 1,000 NGOs from all parts of the world.  The Executive Director of the Institute is also a Fellow of the Carold Foundation for the advancement of citizenship in social change, at both the national and international levels, in addition to being a member of the Ashoka network of social entrepreneurs (a group that includes some 2,500 of the most outstanding social innovators in the world).PublicationsL’état du QuébecThe INM puts out an annual French-language flagship publication, L’état du Québec, a compilation reference aimed at a general (non-specialist) readership and providing a comprehensive portrait of Québec’s political, economic, cultural and social situation for the current year, together with the most recently available statistics.  Further information (in French only) on this book, available in bookstores throughout Québec, can be found at:  http://www.letatduquebec.qc.caA number of supplements to this same publication are prepared for use in INM program activities.

It has the right of initiative and is the guardian of the European Treaties. See  http://europa.eu/  (24 languages available) for more information.

History  See  http://europa.eu/about-eu/eu-history/Specializations and activities  Innovation has been placed at the heart of the EU's strategy to create growth and jobs for 2020.  EU countries are encouraged to invest 3% of their GDP in R&amp;D by 2020 (1% public funding, 2% private-sector investment) - this is expected to create 3.7 million jobs and increase the EU's annual GDP by nearly €800 billion.

About 50 M€ are dedicated each year to funding projects in the field of: citizens engagement in research and innovation, formal and informal education to science, gender equality and gender in research and innovation, open access to scientific results, ethics, and governance. The Commission has been funding participatory processes since 2002 and funds research to better understand and improve their methods and dynamics.  Why ""Science in Society"" at European level?  ""Science is part of almost every aspect of our lives. Although we rarely think about it, science makes extraordinary things possible. At the flick of a switch, we have light and electricity. When we are ill, science helps us get better. It tells us about the past, helps us with the present, and creates ways to improve our future. Scientific endeavour is as much about us as it is for us. Its place in society, therefore, is not to unfold quietly at the sidelines but to become a fundamental part of the game. Now more than ever, science must engage with us, and we must engage with science.  There are times when science can seem to lose its connection to society and its needs, and sometimes its objectives are not fully understood, even if they are well intended. The lack of a common language and rapid progress in many areas of research has increased the public's concern or contributed to ambivalence about the role that science and technology play in everyday life. But science cannot work in isolation, and advances in science and technology are not an objective in their own right.  Build gateways with the public  Of course, while new developments can improve our quality of life and understanding of the world, scientists and policymakers may not always properly assess the potential risks or take full account of the public's concerns. Opportunities must be created for scientists and the general public to exchange views in a two-way dialogue of mutual respect and trust.""

1585,organization,The Bureau d’audiences publiques sur l’environnement – (The Office of Environmental Public Hearings),https://participedia.net/organization/1585,Description not available.,0,2013-12-02,2017-09-18,1109,Bhererla,https://participedia.net/user/1109,1109,Bhererla,https://participedia.net/user/1109,en,,,Québec City,Quebec,,Canada,46.8138783,-71.2079809,Government,,,,,,,,,,,,,environment,,,," Mission and Purpose  The Bureau d'audiences publiques sur l'environnement (BAPE, Public Hearings Office) is a public, neutral, and independent organization that reports to Quebec's Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks. It allows citizens to learn about and express their views on projects that could have repercussions on the environment and on their quality of life as well as on any question related to the quality of the environment. Projects include, among others, roads, landfill sites and industrial, electrical and energy-related projects.  History  In 1978, Quebec modified its Environment Quality Act, which led to the establishment of the Environmental Impact Assessment and Review Procedure under the responsibility of the Minister of Environment, and to the creation of the Bureau d'audiences publiques sur l'environnement (Public Hearings Office).  Marcel Léger, Minister of the Environment under the first René Lévesque government, is the lawmaker behind the creation of the BAPE in 1978. Mr Léger wanted to entrust citizens with a positive role regarding the protection of their environment. He was influenced by the Ontarian legislation of the time. The neighbouring province had already been guaranteeing public participation in the environmental impact assessment procedure for a couple years when the Quebec went forward with the BAPE.  Since its creation, the BAPE received about 850 mandates from the Minister. Around 65% of these mandates were limited to the holding of a public information and consultation period, 26% involved an inquiry and a public hearing, 5% an inquiry and mediation, and 4% involved only an inquiry. By the summer of 2013, the BAPE had released no less than 295 inquiry reports.  In addition to the specific projects that have been entrusted to it, the BAPE held commissions on a number of key topics for Quebec society, such as hazardous waste management (1988-90), forest protection (1990-91), water management (1999-2000), pig production (2002-03) and the shale gas industry (2010-11).  Organizational Structure and Funding  The BAPE is comprised of six full-time members, including a President and a Vice-President, both appointed by the Quebec government.  When the Minister asks the BAPE to hold an inquiry and a public hearing, the President of the BAPE sets up a commission of inquiry and designates the person in charge. The person who chairs the commission is usually a full-time member of the BAPE and is assisted by commissioners chosen based on their expertise in relation to the specific elements and issues of the submitted project. The President can also resort to a list of part-time members appointed by the government.  As commissioners, it is of note that members can require the attendance before them of any person whose evidence may be relevant to the subject of inquiry and can request any document that may be useful in understanding the file. The formal exercise of coercive powers that are officially available to a BAPE commission is, however, avoided wherever possible.  Commissioners must comply with the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct of the Members of the Bureau d'audiences publiques sur l'environnement, a document of 38 articles regarding the general conduct, the duty of reserve and the independence of the commissioners. Among other provisions, the Code specificies that members “shall avoid any situation involving a conflict of interest” and “consider any attempt to interfere with their work as being unacceptable and intolerable”.1  The autonomous character of the BAPE and the independence of its commissioners is a crucial feature of the organization, and has been a constant matter of debate throughout the past few decades. Any nomination or event that raises doubt as to this independence is fiercely condemned by members of the opposition, environmental groups and the media.  This idea of a public, neutral, and independent organization has inspired other initiatives, such as the Commission nationale du débat public (CNDP), in France, and the Office de consultation publique de Montréal (OCPM) in Quebec.  Specializations and Activities  To carry out this basic mission, the BAPE provides information, conducts inquiries and consults the public on projects or questions related to the quality of the environment submitted to the BAPE by the Minister. The BAPE then prepares inquiry reports on these files.  1. Before the BAPE  Before a project is entrusted to the BAPE, it must make it through the following stages outlined by the Minister of Environment in order to comply with government requirements:The proponent notifies the Minister of its intention to carry out a project;  The Minister indicates to the proponent, in a directive, the elements that must be found in the impact study: justification of the project, its impacts, its variants if any, the description of the natural and human environment, the planned mitigation measures, etc.;  The proponent then carries out its impact study and submits it to the Minister*.  Minister specialists analyze, where necessary, if the impact study meets the requirements of the Minister’s directive. Following this verification, the Department may ask the proponent to clarify certain aspects of its impact study before the latter is made public by the BAPE;  Once the impact study is deemed sufficiently complete, the Minister is ready to entrust the BAPE with a first mandate, that of holding a public information and consultation period.*This impact study may include a social part, which generally results from a stakeholder consultation by the proponent. In this regard, public consultation often occurs before the BAPE comes in play. It can be seen as a positive side effect of the institution. Throughout the years, many proponents have begun to do upstream consultations in order to be better prepared for the BAPE hearings...  2. Public information and consultation period  The public information and consultation period consists of making public the impact study and the other documents pertaining to the project. The regulatory duration of this period is 45 days. During this period:The documentation on the project is published on the BAPE website and is made available at consultation centres in Montreal, Quebec city and the region affected by the project; the addresses and telephone numbers of the centres are disseminated by press release, public notices and posters;  The BAPE holds an information session, which citizens from the community in question are invited to attend; at this session, the BAPE explains the procedure, the proponent presents its project, and citizens have the opportunity to ask questions;  It is during this 45-day period that a person, a group, an organization or a municipality in favour of a public discussion and evaluation of the project can submit an application in writing to the Minister requesting a public hearing;  Once the information period is over, the BAPE prepares a report which it then sends to the Minister; this report is added to the documentation available to the public.At the end of an information period, if the Minister has received no request for a hearing, the role of the BAPE ends and the Department will continue its environmental analysis of the project. If the Minister receives a request for a hearing, unless he or she deems it frivolous (unfounded), he or she will then entrust the BAPE with a second mandate, namely that of holding a public hearing. In some cases, the Minister may entrust the BAPE with a mediation mandate, when he or she deems that the subject matter of the requests for a public hearing lends itself to such a mandate.  3. Public hearings  The inquiry and public hearing process takes place over a period of no more than four months, and is divided into two parts. Upon receiving the mandate from the Minister, the BAPE Chairman sets up an inquiry commission composed of one or more commissioners.  During the first part of the hearing, the commission holds public sessions in the region affected by the project. Both the proponent and the resource people identified by the commission are available to answer questions from the general public as well as from the commission. The number of sessions is determined by the commission, based on its own needs and those of the general public.  The end of the first part of the hearing and the beginning of the second part must be at least 21 days apart so that citizens have time to inform the commission secretariat that they intend to submit a brief or make a verbal presentation, and then to prepare their brief or verbal presentation. The second part of hearings is dedicated to those briefs and presentations.  The type of public hearings held by the BAPE is thus different from the traditional model of public hearings found elsewhere in Canada or in the United States. The traditional form of hearings is characterized by the holding of a public assembly led by municipal elected officials, who, on their own or with the help of public servants, present a planning project and then ask for citizens’ opinions on the spot. A study in the United States shows that this type of public hearing generally lasts between a half hour and three hours.6  The practice of the BAPE is distinguished by the facts that: 1) the public hearings are held by an independent organization that has the leeway to invite experts, to ask the developer of the project under examination for additional information and to ensure that citizens’ questions and opinions have been clearly understood; and 2) particular attention is given to access to information, with the relevant documents available in several consultation centres and on the BAPE’s website, and the holding of information sessions describing the project.7  4. Report  When the second part of the hearing is over, the commission drafts its inquiry and public hearing report. The BAPE then makes its report to the Minister, containing its observations and analysis. This must be done within four months from the beginning of the mandate. Most of the time, commissioners also transmit a series of recommendations, opinions and comments to the Minister. It was not originally mentioned in their mandate, but commissioners took the liberty to do so in the first hearings, and it has become an “institutionalised” practice today.  The commission’s work ends at that point. After receiving the report from the BAPE, the Minister then has 60 days to release it to the general public.  Based on its own environmental analysis and on the report prepared by the BAPE, the Minister finally makes recommendations to the government, which in turn is responsible for making the final decision to authorize the project with or without changes on the conditions it determines, or to reject the project.  Major Projects and Events  Among the 60 projects examined by the BAPE from 2000 to 2005, 36% were projects from the private sector, 22% from Hydro-Québec (government-owned corporation), 22% from the Quebec Minister of Transport, 15% from other public agencies and 5% from public private partnerships.5  Less than 100 participants attended 80% of those public hearings. Around 15% of the hearings were attended by 100 to 200 participants, and only one hearing was attended by more than 200.  Half of the 60 BAPE reports were favourable to the projects examined, 30% judged the project “acceptable” and 18,33% were unfavourable.  Among the projects examined, 88,33% were finally authorized subject to certain conditions by the Quebec government, and only 3% were completely refused.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Many experts and scholars have observed the BAPE over the last decades. Clarity, concision, efficiency and credibility are among the qualities that are generally used to describe its procedure. The impartiality and independence of the commissions, as well as their non-judicial but consultative character are listed as characteristics to preserve. People also underline as strengths the openness of the inquiries and hearings, the easy access that is given to information and the power of initiative with which citizens are granted.  On the other hand, however, people generally deplore that the public participation is limited to a single moment and comes often lately in the environmental impact assessment procedure. The conflictual and repetitive character of the hearings is also seen as a negative aspect of the BAPE. Finally, it appears that some proponents are better than others at adapting themselves to the procedure, so they are better able to take advantage of it.  However, in the last 30 years, the BAPE have been a key player in defining a culture of public participation in the province of Quebec, to the extent that public consultation is naturally linked to environmental impact assessment in people minds today.

1586,organization,The Office de consultation publique de Montréal,https://participedia.net/organization/1586,Description not available.,0,2013-12-02,2017-09-18,1109,Bhererla,https://participedia.net/user/1109,1109,Bhererla,https://participedia.net/user/1109,en,,,Montréal,Quebec,,Canada,45.5016889,-73.567256,Government,,,,,,,,,,,,,planning,,,," Created in 2002, the Office de consultation publique de Montréal (OCPM) is an independent public organization whose mission is to carry out public consultation mandates entrusted to it by the Montréal city council or executive committee. It distinguishes itself by its consultation practices based on the concept of an independent, transparent and credible neutral third party.  In its first ten years of existence, the OCPM has held no less than 103 public consultations. Its mandate primarily involves urban and land-use planning projects under municipal jurisdiction, but is not limited to those matters1. For instance, consultations may pertain to the following areas:  · shared or institutional equipment (hospital, university, regional park, etc.)  · major infrastructure (airport, shunting yard, water treatment facility, etc.)  · a residential, commercial or industrial establishment situated in the business district  · a heritage site or site located in a historic and natural borough, a recognized historic monument or classified cultural property  · draft municipal policies, visions or development  However, the OCPM does not have the power to initiate consultations on its own. Its mandates must necessarily come from the city council or the executive committee.  Consultations result in the publication of reports outlining the issues and positions expressed by the citizens. Analysis and recommendations are also formulated to municipal elected officials. The process has no decision-making capacity, but its formal and autonomous nature, as well as the good media coverage it gets, makes it difficult to ignore for the decision-makers.In addition, the Office has the mandate to propose rules to structure public consultation in Montréal to ensure the implementation of credible, transparent and effective consultation mechanisms.  The Genesis of the Office  The first formal public consultation structure appeared in the late 1980s in Montreal, with the creation of the Bureau de consultation de Montréal (BCM). For five years, this organization held public consultations on issues submitted by city authorities. However, at that time, the existence of the BCM was closely linked to the political power in office, as it was constituted under a by-law adopted by the city council. Therefore, in 1994, the new Montréal administration decided to abolish it by revoking the by-law. From then on, public consultations would be held by a single city council standing committee.  Over the years, it became clear that such a mechanism was not enough, and that a more neutral and detailed analysis was necessary for certain important projects. For citizens and groups interested in evaluating and improving a project, consultation proved useless when elected officials had already made up their minds about it.  Responding to critics and pressures from several sectors of civil society, the municipal administration created the Tremblay commission in 2000. This group of five members, led by Gérald Tremblay, was mandated to examine consultation practices pertaining to urban planning.  The Tremblay commission held public hearings over the course of the summer of 2000. In its final report, it then set out a number of recommendations, including that to create an Office de consultation publique with a mandate and mission that would largely inspire the government in the creation of the Office as we know it today.  The Office was finally created on January 1, 2002, at the same time as the new Ville de Montréal following the amalgamation of the island’s cities2. The inclusion of provisions creating the OCPM in the Charter of Ville de Montréal ensured, at that moment, that changing political teams in Montréal’s administration would no longer jeopardize the existence of the Office.  Composition  The OCPM today is composed of a president and 25 partial time or ad hoc commissioners (the position of full-time commissioner was abolished in August 2006, but remains an option under the provisions of the Charter). The commissioners are neither elected officials nor city employees; they are appointed for four years terms by city council by a majority of two-thirds of the votes cast. They are neutral and mandated to ensure that relevant information has been provided and understood, that all participants’ questions have been asked and that all opinions have been heard. They must provide equal treatment to all.  Procedure  A typical public consultation process begins with the Office receiving a mandate from the city council or executive committee. A public notice announcing the consultation is then  published in a daily newspaper at least 15 days prior to the first public session. During that period, a comprehensive dissemination and advertising strategy is implemented. Access to information is seen as crucial. All relevant documents are made available in several of the municipality’s libraries and on the OCPM’s website.  The first part of the consultation then consists of one or more information sessions about the project. In these sessions, the developer and city officials present both the project and the required regulatory framework. These presentations are followed by a question period.  Three weeks later, citizens and organizations that have previously registered come to present their briefs or express their opinions before the commission. These sessions are open to the public. Briefs may also be filed without presentation at the meetings.  Following the consultation sessions, the commission deliberates. In light of the documents submitted for its consideration, questions asked, and opinions received, it drafts the public consultation report outlining the issues and positions expressed. Its analysis and recommendations to municipal elected officials are also included in the report.  When the consultation report is ready, it is sent to the Mayor of Montréal. Two weeks later, it is made public on the OCPM Website and submitted to the city council and executive committee.  A unique model  The type of public hearings held in Montréal is thus different from the traditional model of municipal public hearings found elsewhere in Canada or in the United States. The traditional form of hearings is characterized by the holding of a public assembly led by municipal elected officials, who, on their own or with the help of public servants, present a planning project and then ask for citizens’ opinions on the spot. A study in the United States shows that this type of public hearing generally lasts between a half hour and three hours3.  The practice in Montréal is distinguished by the facts that: 1) the public hearings are held by an independent organization that has the leeway to invite experts, to ask the developer of the project under examination for additional information and to ensure that citizens’ questions and opinions have been clearly understood; and 2) particular attention is given to access to information, with the relevant documents available in several of the municipality’s libraries and on the OCPM’s website, and the holding of evening information sessions describing the project, before citizens voice their opinions after a 15-day delay following the end of the information phase.Quick facts  · In its first ten years of activities, the OCPM received about 2000 briefs and opinions. More than one third of those briefs came from individual citizens. About 25,000 people attended its hearings.  · According to a poll realized for the 10th anniversary of the Office, one Montrealer out of five knew what the OCPM was in 2012. Among those citizens, 86% had a positive opinion of the organization, 85% believed it was useful and 80% considered it was credible.4  · Throughout the years, the Office has shared its experiences with various cities and associations, such as the International Association for Public Participation (IAP2), the Association internationale des maires francophones (AIMF), the World Association of Major Metropolises (Metropolis), and the International Observatory on Participatory Democracy (IOPD). Moreover, the Office has often hosted delegations seeking to learn more about its modus operandi and gather inspiration. This was the case with the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre, which has maintained contact with the Office over the past few years and is in the process of creating a similar autonomous structure.5  Samuel Tremblay, Université de Montréal  This paper is part of a research project funded by the SSHRC, calls ‘Expertise, organizational field and the diffusion of public participation practices’ (2012-2016) and directed by Laurence Bherer (Université de Montréal), Mario Gauthier (Université du Québec en Outaouais) and Louis Simard (Université d’Ottawa).

The proposed method and app  The Net Party uses the  DemocracyOS  open-source software (see  demo ), aiming to provide citizens a new instance of democratic participation. The main features for citizens are:vote on existing legislative projects being discussed in the local parliament, so as to determine how the party ́s congressman will vote; and  propose and vote on new law proposals, to be officially presented by the party ́s congressman if they meet a threshold of citizen support.In the DemocracyOS software each citizen can either cast their vote or can delegate it on a trusted peer (liquid democracy model). Delegation is transitive and can be determined by topic (i.e. a user can delegate economics-related votes on a certain user, environment-related and health-related votes in another user, and keep the remaining topics for himself).  Since this app ́s innovation is that it is linked to the formal political system through a ""Trojan legislator"", identity validation is a crucial component and is achieved through a separate app called NetIdentity.  History  The party was officialy founded in April 2013, received the required support of 4000 citizens (to exist as a party) in August 2013, and ran for a seat in the local parliament of Buenos Aires during the October 2013 elections achieving 21.000 votes (1% of the votes). Is currently working to improve the DemocracyOS furthermore and to get elected its first congressman in the 2015 elections.

We create new movements, institutions and companies that tackle the structural causes of inequality.  We work to create a more equal and just society, where each individual can be fulfilled in their own terms. We believe that little about the future of society is inevitable. Bound by our shared humanity, we believe we collectively have the power to shape the societies and communities we want to live in.  History  We were forged from a merger between the Institute of Community Studies and the Mutual Aid Centre, both creations of our namesake, the late Michael Young, leading social entrepreneur.  The Institute for Community Studies had been set up in 1954 as an urban studies think tank, with an emphasis on bringing academic research and practical social innovation together. It helped to create over 60 organisations, including the Open University and the Consumers’ Association. Other innovations included Language line, International Alert, the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the School for Social Entrepreneurs.  Specializations and activities  We strive to be audacious and determined in our actions, and open and unrelenting in our thinking. We are politically alert but non-partisan. We use the tools of social research, disruptive social innovation, venturing, strategic design and movement building. Above all, we listen to people, putting what they think, feel and believe, their aspirations, their experiences and their lives at the heart of everything we do. In the last five years we’ve launched 60 programmes and 138 publications across the country.  Major projects and eventsTEPSIE:  The TEPSIE research programme is aimed at developing tools, methods and policies to help inform the EU strategy for social innovation. Its purpose is to strengthen the foundations for other researchers, policy-makers and practitioners so that they can analyse and plan with greater confidence. The work involves mapping the field of social innovation, reviewing theories, models, methods and identifying gaps in existing practices and policies, as well as pointing towards the priorities for future strategies.Realising Ambition:  The Young Foundation is a member of the consortium appointed to manage Realising Ambition which is a £25 million  Big Lottery Fund  supported programme investing in projects which have been proven to help children and young people to fulfil their potential, and avoid pathways into crime. Over the next five years, the programme will replicate the best evidence-based practice, reaching over 140,000 8- to 14- year olds across the UK.Better by Design:  Working with BIG and partners, The Young Foundation is working with 15 high potential organisations that can see the potential through design thinking to put users at the centre of their services, improve outcomes and make their organisations more innovative.  The Young Foundation and Taylor Haig are working intensively with these organisations, guiding them through a design-led change process, drawing on user insight and using innovative but practical design techniques. BIG will be making small grants available to support the organisations at key points in the design and change process.

I came up with the idea during one of my daily nature walks; I was thinking about the meaning of success in our society. I was pondering whether it may be time to widen the definition. We all hear about the economy, and about political and social debates regarding climate change, and the effect of money in politics, and that sort of thing... Without getting ""too political,"" it seems to me that the economic system, which relies on faster and faster growth and increased productivity, may be running into natural limits when it comes to what the natural environment can handle, as well as the capacity of workers to handle increased levels of productivity (while wages remain stagnant).Regardless of where you are in the political spectrum when it comes to these issues, I think that the reason we hear more and more references to sustainability (in economics, in the workplace, in food production, in business, in consumption) is because a growing number of people are realizing that the demands of the current system (based on the financialization of the productive sector) is unsustainable, and, as this realization spreads, a consensus is starting to build around the need to slow things down a bit and reexamine the meaning of success, happiness, and need. So, as I thought about it, I came up with an idea: About launching a website/program/project specifically designed to promote sustainable economic practices? So I decided on a name, MyCityMarket.net. Here's what I have so far regarding the mission: A  think tank  and/or  business incubator  focused on promoting sustainable economic practices, locally-owned (small) businesses, the arts, music, civics, volunteering, and non-traditional business enterprises, including cooperatives, employee-owned businesses, and benefit corporations.I'm very interested inhearing from peoplewho have also been thinking about these things and would like to share ideas and/or provide feedback or assistance.

They are working to transform how people envision democracy, and to develop innovative ways for even the largest organizations, communities, and governments to be truly democratic—not just in theory or in name, but in practice.  By putting into practice more inclusive and participative forms of government, they aim to work on a social level to foster individuals that are both engaged and capable of working with those different from themselves. The organization believes this underpins not only the political change  toward  a better democracy, but also the long-term success of  democracy itself .Origins and DevelopmentFounded in Bolivia in 2013,  Democracy In Practice  helps transform open-minded groups and communities into laboratories of democratic innovation where new approaches to governance can be experimented with and developed. They then share the insights and ideas generated by this experimentation in order to inspire others to see democracy in new ways.Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingKnow how this organization operates internally? Help uscomplete this section!Specializations, Methods and ToolsKnow what areas this organization specializes in or what methods and tools they use? Help uscomplete this section!Major Projects and EventsDemocratic experimentation is currently underway in the  student governments of three schools in Cochabamba, Bolivia.  Typically, student governance mirrors the basic structure of adult governance: a few students seek nomination, run one-day campaigns, and hold elections. After the votes are cast, the vast majority of students are excluded from further participation. Instead,  Democracy In Practice  is helping students – in their first encounter with ‘democracy’ – experiment with new approaches that are more inclusive, representative, and effective.  One such approach involves random selection and rotation. In these schools  Democracy In Practice  has replaced candidates and elections with  lotteries  in which students are randomly selected to assume temporary positions within the student government. After limited terms, these students rotate out and are replaced by other randomly selected students so that, over time, all students (even the shyest and least popular among them) have the chance to work as part of a team, assume responsibilities, and serve their peers and school as student-leaders. Combining random selection with rotation ensures that the student governments broadly represent the diversity within each student body (e.g. gender, age, and ethnic differences) instead of a single clique or type of student, and allows more students to participate directly.  Putting these innovative approaches to the test means encouraging and empowering students to improve their school community in concrete ways that they identify. To that effect, randomly selected student governments have organized enjoyable events such as school-wide field trips and theater competitions, while also addressing complex problems like the need for more sustainable waste-disposal systems, the lack of a school library, and the high cost of transportation to and from school. Beyond tackling challenging issues within the structure of these new approaches to government, the organization is also pushing students to take ownership of the design itself, direct the experimentation with different democratic practices and processes themselves, and develop their own original ideas.Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

4173,organization,MoveOn,https://participedia.net/organization/4173,Description not available.,0,2014-12-23,2017-09-17,69498,"""Philipp B""",https://participedia.net/user/69498,69498,"""Philipp B""",https://participedia.net/user/69498,en,,,,,,United States,37.09024,-95.712891,Non-Profit or Non Governmental,,,,,,,,,,,,,human, law, international,," History  MoveOn was founded by the married couple Joan Blades and Wes Boyd during the Lewinsky affair in the late 1990s. Tired of scandal-focused politics, they started a web site providing a petition addressed to Congress, to censure Clinton‘s behaviour but to continue working on serious political issues. Within a week the petition was subscribed to by more than 100.000 people. Nevertheless, Congress didn‘t react to the petition though MoveOn gained some medial attention.  After the Lewinsky affair MoveOn possessed a great email list, but missed a main purpose. This situation changed with the terror attacks of 11 September 2001 and the following war against terrorism. It fused with the mailing list of Eli Pariser by making him the executive director. His list, 9-11.org, was as big as the one of MoveOn, and together they became the leading voice in the anti war movement and an important progressive political actor. It gave significant support to Barack Obama‘s election campaign, carried out other political projects and developed new opportunities of participation.  Organizational Structure and Funding  Move on is based on it‘s enormous number of members. As it‘s mails are received by 4.5 million people, it can generate powerful action, if just a small part of the recipients read the email and even a smaller part can be engaged to really take action.  There also exist 250 MoveOn Councils which consist of a minimum of four MoveOn members and work on local issues and organize physical actions. Council members gain a certain reputation within the organisation, but after the election of Obama they got less important.  In contrast to it‘s great corpus of members it‘s internal bureaucratic structure is rigorously minimalistic. There are 19 people working full time on the emails and the analysis of member data but there is no physical office in order to avoid any infrastructure costs. Besides the 19 employees there are eleven field organizers who support the work of the councils.  So in contrast to many other interest group organisations MoveOn dispenses to employ scientists, specialists or lobbyists who focus on a specific topic to directly influence the political process or debate. Instead it is formed as a generalist organisation without a special topic but with progressive political attitudes, which allows MoveOn to work on a range of different topics, and so to succesfully address a wide range of people.  Specializations and Activities  As MoveOn is a generalist organisation it works with a great membership on many different topics. It is essential to have such a big mailing list as not everyone is interested in every topic, and even not everyone interested can be encouraged to take action. But as there are so many people receiving the mails, there remain enough people to react and generate effective action.  The role of the internet as a medium for information for this kind of organisation is important, as there is almost no relation between the costs and the number of recipients. So the internet enabled MoveOn to become a generalist, and MoveOn itself understood the new rules of online communication to build up an efficient organisation by redefining the concept of membership. A MoveOn member needs to do almost nothing apart from reading some of the received emails and to participate once a year or even less. The crucial point is that inactivity doesn‘t harm the efficience or effectiveness of the organisation anymore, as it would have been if it sent physical letters or if there was an unreliable member in a group. Instead, even someone who had not taken action for years still offers the chance to participate and give a valuable contribution. And if not, he or she still didn‘t cost anything.  But next to it‘s bare size, there are different factors making MoveOn a succesfull actor. It does not send too many emails to not make anyone perceive them as spam. And not every member gets every email. MoveOn analyses it‘s members by the projects they participate or donate, so if there is a special issue which fits an appropriate group just these members will receive the email. This way, people with special interests stay informed and can participate in theses topics, without sending too many emails. But there are also emails sent to all of the members, to use the full potential of the large mailing list.  Furthermore, MoveOn pretests it‘s emails according to scientific standards. To do so it sends different versions of an email to a small but representative group of members and analyses the outcome, e.g. in terms of open rates and clickthrough rates. Afterwards, MoveOn sends an optimized email with the best chances to appeal to the addressees and make them take action.  Also the point of time for MoveOn is an important variable to reach the best effect. It‘s gearded to the daily media and sends emails relating to current issues. So the people are familiar with the topic and are interested already. This increases the chance to create action. Also everyone gets encouraged as it is emphasized that even small donations are a valuable contribution.  In addition, MoveOn asks its members which topics they are interested in and integrates them into the communication process. For example, it held a contest between the members who could send in a video with the title „Bush in 30 seconds“. The members also voted on which was the best one and as a result MoveOn gained the best video to address its audience. Of course a video originating in such a process has a highly viral potential. Virality is another important factor which helps MoveOn to generate 500.000 new members each year.  Overall MoveOn appears to be the prototype of a new modern internet based not for profit organisation as it managed to optimize it‘s techniques of communication for the digital media. It redefined the concept of membership, reduced to receiving mails and occasionally participation. This enabeled MoveOn to become a great and succesfull generalist organisation.  Major Projects and Events  MoveOn became an important political actor as its not just the biggest interest group today, but outperforms every participatory group ever appeared in the United States. It managed to generate large amounts of money and other ressources to support political parties or other organisations and so exert influence on politics and society.  MoveOn changed the mode people participate in politics as its concept of a giant online based generalist organisation appears to be a disruptive innovation in the sector of citizen participation. Karpf compares its effect in the world of participation with the significance Amazon.com had on the book trade (Karpf, 2009).Case Examples:MoveOn supported Barack Obamas campaign during the elections in 2008. It collected 88 million dollars and more than 900.000 volunteers worked for more than 20 million hours to support Obama. Again MoveOn proceeded quite strategically and organized a campaign called „Call for Change“, demonstrating flexibility and creativity. As the areas who mostly supported the democrats also contained many MoveOn members and councils, areas less supporting the democrats contained less members to work for the campaign. So the „Call for Change“ participants in the democrat dominated regions got telephone lists of the battleground states, and so promoted Obama in those regions, where the decision was ambiguous.  Another project demonstrating MoveOn‘s strategical procedure is the donation campaign for different progressive organisations betrayed by Bernard Maddof, a Wall Street financier. The issue was in the media so everyone knew about the background. And as there where different organisations scammed, a wide range of people with different interests could be effectively addressed. Furthermore MoveOn found two organisations which matched every donated dollar with one dollar, but just if the donation came in within a short deadline. So the people knew about the issue, most probably knew about an organisation they liked benefiting from the donations and really where motivated to donate immediately.Secondary Sources  Karpf, D., 2009.

This will also encourage government accountability and support community integration.  History  Started in May, 2014  About Us  EcoMap India is a citizen initiative that utilizes online mapping power of citizens to collect and disseminate reports on local environmental issues across India. Our aim to harness the power of crowd as well as exploit open source digital technologies and give this power back to people.We are pinning issues that might traditionally not seen as environmental or ecological problem but seen in context of urban habitat in a global world are. From polluted, inadequate water supply (that would indicate a polluted source), to un-breathable air (air pollution), to breaching noise limits (noise pollution), unsound waste disposal (as is rampant in most of India), we want people to take notice and know the legislation (by bringing awareness) while creating the only repository of reports on environmental issues faced by people.The reports at ourcrowdmapare open to contribution anonymously, available to all, easily downloadable as well as share-able. You can see it as just another step towards democratizing of knowledge as a tool for citizen empowerment, better governance as a well as environmental awareness.

The project is carried out at the Department of Political Science and Contemporary History at the University of Turku.  Mission and Purpose  Research question 1: How widely are democratic innovations used in Finland? RQ 2: How democratic innovations affect and are perceived in policy processes? RQ 3: Does the use of democratic innovations increase legitimacy of the decision-making? RQ 4: What kinds of civil society actors and individuals have taken advantage of the new possibilities for participation at the national level? RQ 5: How can the use of democratic innovations be modified to improve the quality of Finnish democracy?  By the end of year 2016 the research team led by prof. Maija Setälä hopes to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how democratic innovations can help improve the functioning of the representative democracy both from the perspective of decision-makers and citizens. This includes identifying what the main obstacles are for realizing the potential benefits promised by the democratic innovations and how these can best be achieved. These results are given out on several channels, including peer-reviewed articles, a final report, a closing seminar and popularized writings.  History and background  The interest in democratic innovations has increased also in Finland, although from a comparative perspective Finland has been a cautious user of democratic innovations. At the national level, advisory referendums have been constitutionally provided since 1987, and the institution of citizens’ initiative was adopted in 2012. This new instrument has raised a lot of interest and public debate in Finland. In a comparative perspective (Setälä &amp; Schiller 2012), the Finnish system of citizens’ initiatives has certain specific characteristics. First, the possibility for collecting signatures online on  www.kansalaisaloite.fi  is relatively unique in the world. It is also possible for non-state actors to organize the collection of signatures online. Second, the decision made in Spring 2012 to use open committee hearings in conjunction with citizens’ initiatives can potentially increase the overall transparency of parliamentary proceedings. In addition, deliberative mini-publics and crowdsourcing have also been tested at the national level. At the local level, the repertoire of democratic innovations is larger. Instruments of advisory municipal referendum, agenda initiatives and initiatives for an advisory referendum have been provided in the municipal law since 1990. Different forms of discursive participation, such as citizen juries, citizen committees, public hearings and online platforms are used in many municipalities. In a comparative perspective, democratic innovations are most widely used at the local level (Newton &amp; Geissel 2012). In the area of local public administration the interest in new forms of participation has increased especially because of municipal mergers and New Public Management. Traditionally strong local autonomy, however, makes Finland a special case together with other Nordic countries. There is not much legislation obliging municipalities to consult and engage citizens outside elections, and the Local government act only recommends how citizens could be engaged in the decision-making, resulting thus in great variance in the actual use of democratic innovations across municipalities. The local political context is therefore more crucial for political equality in Finland than in many other countries exploring forms of civic participation. Finland is, however, still predominantly a representative democracy in the sense that the formal decision-making power always remains within representative institutions. In this respect, it is uncertain whether the use of democratic innovations has changed the patterns of power-sharing in Finland.  Specializations and activities  Research questions are answered by analysing a set of different materials with both quantitative and qualitative methods. As part of the project new datasets will be gathered on subjects and use of the different forms of participation on national and local level. Several surveys will be conducted on the participators themselves.  Major projects and events  Upcoming closing seminar in the fall of 2016 in Helsinki, Finland. Open to public.  Funding  The project is funded by the Prime Minister's Officein Finland.

The platform facilitates a two-way communication between the city and its citizens. Citizens post ideas, discuss them with each other and upvote the best ideas — in a fun and easy accessible way. On the other end, city officials use CitizenLab to consult the opinion of their citizens via polling or to ask their creative solutions to an existing problem. This 'sofware as a solution' model helps cities to tap into the collective intelligence of the citizens and become more responsive to their citizens’ needs.  CitizenLab aims at making tomorrow’s governments more citizen-centric, through their user-friendly cloud software, insightful data analytics and focus on mobile.  Citizens want to engage, but often lack the means to do it in an easy accessible way. Today’s citizen participation possibilities in cities are limited to bureaucratic ""pen and paper"" forms, time-consuming in-person visits and town halls meetings, and a single vote every X years. However, in addition to these 'traditional' forms of engagement, existing technologies now make it possible to create an interaction between city and citizens that is less time-consuming, is much cheaper and reaches a wider audience.  CitizenLab's goal is to make the most user-friendly cloud software for cities to get closer to their citizens. We take a data-driven approach in order to provide cities with the most insightful analytics on their citizens. CitizenLab wants to help cities to not only become reactive to their citizens’ needs, but also predictive. The organization is committed to providing the resources necessary for governments to adopt cloud software and unlock the collective brainpower of their citizens.  Specializations and Activities  CitizenLab's 'citizensourcing' software is ready-to-use, yet fully customisable in an easy-to-use admin panel. The city can easily change the design of the platform, as well as pick its language out of already more than 20 available languages. The platform stands out by its user-friendly design, making it possible for every citizen to participate. The organization works with clean cards, different categories and an intuitive user interface on both desktop and mobile — submitting, commenting or upvoting is never more than two clicks away.  In addition, CitizenLab makes use of gamification in order to incentivise the citizens. Every time their posts or comments get upvoted, they will earn points (resulting in new badges) and will move up in the citizen leaderboard. The city gets quantified insights on which citizens are most engaged and can reward them for their valuable input with real-life benefits. Citizens analytics are not only coming from the online platform - they also allow the user to export and integrate them with any other product. This method gives cities a 'one-stop portal' to get insights on their citizens’ needs.  History CitizenLab was started in July 2015 by Wietse Van Ransbeeck and Aline Muylaert.  Funding  Incubated by the Belgian accelerator iMinds with 25k EUR in funding.  External Linkshttp://citizenlab.co  ",1,0,0,0,0,

It hosts discussions about a variety of politically-relevant issues, such as education, economics, and immigration.  History  Founded in June 2014 for the UK, YouthDebates seeks to empower youth to share their political views and debate issues among their peers. Partnering with other discussion-oriented organizations such as EDeb8 to promote youth activism, YouthDebates has received a following of several thousand youth. In August 2014, YouthDebates relinquished its UK domain name and became a “.org” site, signalling its intention to seek an international audience. Also starting in August 2014, YouthDebates began quarterly publishing a free online publication called ‘The Pamphleteer.’ Members of YouthDebates were able to submit short articles (bounded at 500 words) to an editor, who compiled ‘The Pamphleteer.’  Consisting of forums and a database of other youth empowerment organizations, YouthDebates seeks to be an all-inclusive and collaborative site for youth. It has five main aims: 1) to be a welcoming community for members of all views, 2) to inspire healthy debate for mutual growth, 3) to encourage youth engagement in politics, 4) to give information to youth people who want to be more involved in politics, and 5) to have its debates influence mainstream politics.  Origanizational Structure and Funding  YouthDebates is largely a non-profit. It was founded by Alexander Firth, who started it primarily for the UK. He was joined by Ryan Chatt, who become the Public Relations Director after the launch. YouthDebates expanded outside of the UK starting in August 2014. However, it does use advertisements and a premium membership option to pay for costs of website maintenance, running the organization, and publicity of the site. There are no fees to participating on the site. The site also accepts standard donations.  Specializations and Activities  Any youth can participate by going to YouthDebates.org. The site is divided into a British Politics Forum, American Politics Forum, Irish Politics Forum, Canadian Politics Forum, Australian Politics Forum, New Zealand Politics Forum, South African Politics Forum, and Indian Politics Forum. YouthDebates also includes an information section on British and American voting as well as various other resources and media items for a multiplicity of nationalities. Youth can blog about issues as well. Also, the Atlantis Senate was introduced as a political role-playing game, giving youth the ability to control their own politician in a senate/parliamentary setting.  YouthDebates.Org is largely an online political forum, so it is by nature a collaborative and deliberative public endeavor. YouthDebates wanted to provide a forum for all youth to be able to “vent their political views” on issues affecting us.  Major Projects and Events  Since its founding in 2014, YouthDebates has had 190,000+ posts, 9000+ debates, and 3300+ registered individuals participating in the debate forums. The page has received over 39,000 likes on Facebook.  Despite its intention to become an internationally popular site, the majority of users of YouthDebates.Org are from the UK and are aged 13 to 25. There are growing bases in the U.S., Canada, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.

 UNITY was founded to cultivate strong, self-reliant Native youth that will be assets to their communities as involved civic members. It also serves as a forum for discussion about problems facing both the individual indigenous peoples and the larger Native American community. Through sharing their experiences and encouraging each other to grow as citizens of their democracies, UNITY trains Native students to develop leadership skills that will allow each to become a representative voice in their nation. 
 Origins and Development 
 Founded in 1976 by J.R. Cook, a Cherokee from Oklahoma, UNITY evolved from a small group of passionate students who attended programming in southwestern Oklahoma to the national networking organization that hosts semi-annual conferences attended by youth councils from 35 states and Canada. J.R. Cook initially founded a dropout prevention, mentoring, and cultural retention organization, catering specifically to 10 public schools in Oklahoma. However, in 1976, due to the organization's success at building member's self-esteem, it was transformed from a regional to a national organization, gaining non-profit incorporated status. 
 At the UNITY conference in 1980 in Great Falls, Montana, the attendees pledged to refocus the organization to increase Native youth participation in government decision making and economic development. They published a ""Declaration for Independence"" in order to publicly take charge of their decisions and lives, which gained UNITY national recognition after Paul Harvey's commentary. 
 Today, UNITY is focused on facilitating a cross-tribal dialogue regarding community improvement, cultural retention, youth education, and healthy lifestyle campaigns on reservations. It reaches over 50,000 Native youth from more than 220 youth councils. 
 Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 J.R. Cook, a Cherokee, incorporated UNITY as a charitable organization in southwestern Oklahoma. Funding is provided by donors and is overseen by a Council of Trustees, the governing board of UNITY. Youth CouncilsNative American youth can form a youth council, which is a community of individuals who want to impact meaningful change in their communities. Youth Councils can originate from high school cultural clubs, recognized tribal youth councils, church-sponsored youth groups, or university Native American associations. Once formed, a youth council can then apply to join the overarching UNITY organization in order to receive the trainings regarding civic participation and leadership that UNITY provides. UNITY provides a list of suggested steps in forming a youth council as well as applying to join UNITY. 
 The application process to join UNITY is democratic: members of the youth council must vote to apply to UNITY. The application process includes: Drafting of a resolution to make the youth council a permanent part of the tribal government or other supervising organization's structure 
 A steering committee is designated to determine the needs of the community, which will then form the bylaws and objectives of the youth council 
 Youth council members elect to uphold the bylaws and objectives by passing the resolution, effectively drafting a youth council constitution 
 An advisory council of elders, parents, or otherwise experienced inviduals is formed to oversee the youth council 
 Elections should then be held for youth council officers 
 Members then conduct their meetings regularly and uphold the passed bylaws and objectives of their youth council 
 After following these prescribed steps, the youth council is established and it can seek membership within UNITY, which is done by members of the youth council voting to join the organization 
 Once this resolution to join UNITY is passed, a copy can be sent to the UNITY office with a filled-out logistical application. It costs $25 to join the UNITY network. Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 Affiliated Youth Councils are strongly encouraged to provide trainings to community members to strengthen cultural ties and educate them as to their political and environmental system. Specifically, Affiliated Youth Councils are required to promote education, healthy lifestyles, cultural learning, and community engagement through service. 
 Once the youth council is formed from members of a single or many Native nation(s) or tribe(s) and is accepted into UNITY, one male and one female from the now Affiliated Youth Council can serve as representatives of the youth council to members of UNITY at their semi-annual conference. The male and female representatives from the Affiliated Youth Council become members of the larger Native UNITY Council, which includes a male and female representative from each member youth council. The National Youth Council was founded in 1992 as a means of better integrating Affiliated Youth Councils in the UNITY community. 
 The semi-annual UNITY conference changes location regularly, but its goal to integrate Native youth into a larger community remains. At the conferences, UNITY members are able to meet Native leaders from a variety of tribes and backgrounds. This sharing of experiences is designed as a learning opportunity in and of itself for participants of the conferences. At these conferences, members can vote on UNITY initiatives as well.

The idea to create a ""Parliament watch"" ( Vouli in Greek means ""parliament"") digital platform in Greece was conceived by Antonis Schwarz, a young entrepreneur in 2013, after the success of such a platform in Germany [3].  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The team has been managed by Stefanos Loukopoulos, the current managing director who returned to Greece after a considerable career in non-profit entities in Brussels to run the project on a day to day basis. As of September 2015, Maria Alexiou, a senior in Law from the University of Athens, joined the group as VouliWatch's first trainee, responsible for daily operations and content management.Maria Nathanail (lawyer, current Chief of Communications) was responsible for promotional and communications affairs and drafted a detailed social media plan for VouliWatch.Vouliwatch ""is financially independent, it does not accept financial support from political parties, politicians nor corporations and does not wish to generate income through advertising on its website. It values its independence as it believes it to be one of its greatest assets.""[2] Six months after its launch, VouliWatch attracted the attention of international foundations and begun receiving project-based grants by the Open Society Foundation. In November 2015, VouliWatch ran a  crowdfunding  campaign on Indiegogo and raised more than 12,000 euros [4].

[1] The organization aims to find and amplify local resources available for and from grassroots leadership and organisations, by developing environments for sharing and exchanging information, knowledge, and experience as well as coordinating on issues of urgent and long-term concern. [2]  Origins and Development  In 2009, Micha Kurz and Khaled Farrag, an Israeli and a Palestinian activist, realized that in Jerusalem, a platform for civil action against house demolitions, evictions, and settlement activities was missing. The initial idea behind Grassroots Jerusalem was to provide a space for Palestinian activists to exchange, coordinate, and deliberate. Secondly, the founders understood that Palestinian community voices in Jerusalem are not heard on political levels. In 2011,  Grassroots  opened the  Markaz Al Kul  (Centre for All) community center in Sheikh Jarrah, an East Jerusalem neighborhood, with the support of Dan Church Aid and the European Commission.  Grassroots  quickly established lasting partnerships with over half the Palestinian communities in Jerusalem, building strong relationships with leaders and community-based organizations (CBOs). Since 2011, new community maps have been designed and visions and implementation plans have been developed within each partner community. An online information source for the coordination of humanitarian development and advocacy was implemented and a ‘Legal Clinic’, providing legal advice for Palestinian Jersualemites, was established. In 2013, the NGO expanded and moved into its present political community center which it named  AlMarsa —The Harbour.  Despite its Israeli-Palestinian founding figures,  Grassroots  is a Palestinian organization working with Palestinian communities only. The rationale is that peaceful co-existence is an unworkable idea in a situation of occupation and continuous dispossession. Co-existence in that sense invites the occupied to acquiesce to their situation of rightlessness. Regarding the idea of co-existence as a normalization of the occupation,  Grassroots  discourse, accordingly, strongly prioritizes freedom and ending the occupation. [3]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingKnow how this organization operates internally? Help uscomplete this section!Specializations, Methods and Tools  To realise their vision, Grassroots Jerusalem has developed three interlocking pillars (Mapping and Assessment, Local Mobilisation, Global Mobilisation) that support their platform for community development and advocacy. Together, they provide a platform for change agents to develop their own capacity and enable the development of their communities. [2]  With its  mapping  activities, Grassroots  aims to communicate the realities of spatial control, to identify issues of shared concern, and to provide the information necessary for community members to connect, coordinate and advocate.  Grassroots works towards realizing the latent capacity of Palestinian civil society by visually mapping the seemingly disparate spatial moments of suppression and highlighting patterns of resistance and self-representation in collaborative mappings. [3]  Major Projects and EventsKnow what projects or events this organization has led or supported? Help uscomplete this section!Analysis and Lessons LearnedGrassroots  has built an organization that is anchored in the great majority of Jerusalem’s Palestinian communities. It has become a hub and a public space for community organization in the city.  Grassroots , however, aims higher. The level to be reached, as one of its full-time employees says, is that “nobody can ignore the communities anymore”—neither Israel, with its continued annexation and settlement politics in what it regards as its “undivided capital”, nor the Palestinian leadership itself, nor those international actors whose influence weighs heavy on the conflict. [3]Grassroots  is a political organization operating in a politically charged environment. Thus, some communities had problems accepting  Grassroots  as an organization whose leadership is both Israeli and Palestinian. The joint Palestinian-Israeli management sometimes gives the impression that the organization works by the values of co-existence. To Palestinians, this is considered as normalization of the occupation, and under this wrong impression, they might refrain from working with the organization. However, the work of  Grassroots  can overall be considered a success. The NGO has gained trust within the communities by not advocating pre-defined political goals, but rather strictly following the lead of the community interlocutors themselves.

They are not a bank in the ordinary sense but a unique partnership to reduce poverty and support development. The World Bank Group comprises five institutions managed by their member countries.  [2]Origins and Development  Established in 1944, the World Bank Group is headquartered in Washington, D.C. We have more than 10,000 employees in more than 120 offices worldwide.[2]Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingKnow how this organization operates internally? Help uscomplete this section!Specializations, Methods and Tools  The World Bank provides low-interest loans, zero to low-interest credits, and grants to developing countries. These support a wide array of investments in such areas as education, health, public administration, infrastructure, financial and private sector development, agriculture, and environmental and natural resource management. Some projects are cofinanced with governments, other multilateral institutions, commercial banks, export credit agencies, and private sector investors.  The Bank also provides or facilitate financing through trust fund partnerships with bilateral and multilateral donors. Many partners have asked the Bank to help manage initiatives that address needs across a wide range of sectors and developing regions.[3][2]Major Projects and Events  The World Bank supports developing countries through policy advice, research and analysis, and technical assistance. Analytical work often underpins World Bank financing and helps inform developing countries’ own investments. In addition, the organization supports citizen and community capacity development in the countries it serves. They also sponsor, host, or participate in many conferences and forums on issues of development, often in collaboration with partners.  To ensure that countries can access the best global expertise and help generate cutting-edge knowledge, the Bank is constantly seeking to improve the way it shares its knowledge and engages with clients and the public at large. Key priorities include:Results: continued efforts to sharpen their focus on helping developing countries deliver measurable results.[4]  Reform: working to improve every aspect of our work: how projects are designed, how information is made available (Access to Information), and how to bring our operations closer to client governments and communities.[5]  Open Development: offering a growing range of free, easy-to-access tools, research and knowledge to help people address the world's development challenges.[6] For example, the  Open Data website  offers free access to comprehensive, downloadable indicators about development in countries around the globe.

The course focuses on the design of collective spaces in collaboration with its inhabitants. Students learn from the experience people gained in the spaces they inhabit and take into account their needs, aspirations and expertise as make proposals to transform existing spaces. At the same time, community members receive some technical and design knowledge from the students, and this knowledge helps them to continue maintaining and developing the spaces in which they reside. On the other hand, the students, taking into account the requirements of the inhabitants, establish guidelines to design spaces for collective use that reflect the identity of the community.  The name “Collaboration” is used for this studio because, unlike “Participation”, it suggests equal conditions in the work to be performed by all involved. Therefore, a project is not just for the community but is done with the community.  Keeping this in mind, students are required to observe how spaces in a community are inhabited, to find out patterns of behaviour in them and to derive spatial qualities from these patterns. Then, they have to design a process of dialogue or interaction with residents to exchange information about the spaces and know their needs and ideas. This process should be interactive, inclusive, with images and even playful so that the largest number of people gets involved. After getting the inputs from the residents, students have to make design proposals consulting every idea with the residents. Finally, they have to build part of the project together with the community. This methodology based on observing and discussing, designing and building with the community helps to bridge the gap between academy and practice. ***  El propósito de este taller es acercar a estudiantes de arquitectura, arquitectura paisajista, urbanismo, planificación, diseño e ingeniería a la realidad de las personas que habitan y utilizan los espacios que proyectan en un entorno colectivo. Los estudiantes aprenden de la experiencia de las personas (habitantes/usuarios para quienes trabajen y con quienes colaboren) en los espacios que habitan y toman en cuenta sus necesidades, sus aspiraciones y su conocimiento del lugar al momento de proyectar. Conjuntamente estas personas aprenden del conocimiento académico y técnico de los futuros arquitectos y se sienten capacitados para continuar manteniendo y desarrollando el espacio en el que residen. El taller se especializa en el diseño y construcción de espacios de uso común. La finalidad es que juntos, futuros arquitectos y habitantes, colaboren en la creación de espacios habitables de calidad. Se utiliza el concepto colaboración porque implica una igualdad de condiciones.Mission and PurposeTo bridge the gap that often exists between the academy and the practice, as well as the academic knowledge of the architects and the experience of the inhabitants.  To create an environment in which experts and dwellers collaborate in the process of shaping the built environment.  To encourage students to design spaces which foster the participation of people over time. Students are trained to be architects, but will also learn to be counselors and mediators.  To empower the inhabitants to be aware of the space they occupy so that they can proceed to care and improve their living spaces.  To encourage students to design spaces that can evolve over time along with the inhabitants.***Objetivos Generales:1. Salvar la brecha que muchas veces existe entre la academia y la práctica, como también la que existe entre el conocimiento académico de los arquitectos y la experiencia de los habitantes. 2. Poner el conocimiento académico al servicio de comunidades que necesitan arquitectos que los orienten y los ayuden a describir y materializar el espacio en el que desean vivir. 3. Permitir que no solo se proyecten espacios para habitar sino que también se proyecten espacios para la participación de los habitantes en el proceso. Además de educarse para ser arquitectos, arquitectos paisajistas, urbanistas, planificadores, diseñadores o ingenieros, aprenden a ser orientadores y mediadores. 4. Crear un entorno en el que estudiantes de arquitectura, arquitectura paisajista, urbanismo, planificación, diseño e ingeniería y habitantes colaboren en la creación de espacios habitables. 5. Empoderar a los habitantes para que tomen conciencia del espacio que habitan y puedan continuar manteniéndolo y desarrollándolo. 6. Exponer a los estudiantes al conocimiento de la tectónica de un proyecto.  Objetivos Específicos:1. Aprender sobre procesos colaborativos de diseño y construcción de espacios habitables. 2. Que los habitantes los ayuden a entender mejor el lugar en el que intervienen y sus necesidades como comunidad. Luego, con sus diseños, pueden capacitar a los habitantes sobre exploración de la forma, utilización del espacio y materialidad. 3. Tomando en cuenta los requerimientos de los habitantes, pueden sentar pautas al proyectar espacios que reflejen la identidad de la comunidad. 4. Conjuntamente, tienen la experiencia de construir sus diseños de manera que aprenden sobre la viabilidad de un proyecto y sobre técnicas constructivas.  History  In Fall 2012, the first project of the COLLABORATIVE Design Studio was conducted outside the university in conjunction with  Proyecto ENLACE,  a public-private entity that helps residents of the eight neighborhoods that surrounds the  Caño Martin Peña  in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to help improve their living conditions. Volunteers from different disciplines such as design, graphic design, urban planning, architecture, landscape architecture, engineering or sociology, and mostly college students designed and developed a participatory process (using photomontages, images, clue words and questions) to help residents of Buena Vista –one of Santurce’s neighborhood to communicate their necessities. The end result; residents and volunteers painted all the houses of the street #1 - with the colors they chosen, they built site specific urban furniture and created a garden in an underground landfill using recycled materials.  The second project of the studio was an initiative of the School of Architecture at the Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico carried out in 2013. Students helped residents of Alto del Cabro neighborhood, in San Juan, to improve unused and depraved spaces. In this particular situation, there was no support from other organizations. Students designed a participatory process to acquire ideas together with the residents. This participatory process included a blackboard where residents could write their aspirations regarding the neighborhood and a puzzle game with which they could explore and identify opportunities for development.  The third project took place in 2014. It was an initiative of the Municipality of San Juan to revitalize an abandoned bridge in the Tras Talleres neighborhood. It was in Tras Talleres that the trains that used to traversed the island with goods and passengers were repaired. Students devised an interactive timeline in which residents of the nearby neighborhood could display their memories of the train (oral history) and a map in which they identified -applying the elements of Kevin Lynch, trails, edges, districts, nodes and landmarks nearby the bridge. With this information, students made a preliminary design, highlighting the bridge as landmark, portal and meeting place.  A fourth project carried out in 2015 emerged from an initiative with the community association “Machuchal Revive” in San Juan. One of the main goals of the association was to rescue an abandoned house, called Casa Taft 169 (because of its location in Taft Street #169). The Casa was to be converted into a civic center. Students created four game booths, which residents visited to express their ideas for the development of the civic center. Then, they made an architectural model of the house with interchangeable parts that could be combined in different ways by the participants. Finally, students built two of the proposed interventions with the help of community members; a wall in the backyard, which separates the neighboring yard, and a door that facilitates access to the house.The fifth project carried out with students of the School of Architecture of the Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico in 2016 consisted of helping the community of TrasTalleres to restore an abandoned building to become the Museum of Memory of the Neighborhood. Students designed a participatory process with questions as part of a giant domino game with the neighborhood's historic symbols replacing the numbers. Taking into account the community's input, they designed a door for the museum and refurbished the façade.  ***  El taller fue fundado en el año 2012 por la profesora y doctora en arquitectura Omayra Rivera Crespo en San Juan, Puerto Rico.

It monitors government progress in this regard, particularly to ensure access for the poor and vulnerable populations. Their mission is to work towards a South Africa where the constitution is upheld and human rights are recognized in law and respected in practice and the government is accountable and responsive to the people.  Origins and Development  The organisation has a long history of working against injustice in the country. The Black Sash was established in 1955 by a small group of white middle-class women (who were predominantly English-speaking) when they formed an organization called The Women's Defence of the Constitution League. Founder members were Jean Sinclair, Ruth Foley, Elizabeth McLaren, Tertia Pybus, Jean Bosazza and Helen Newton-Thompson (among others). The organisation was formed as a protest to oppose the Senate Bill that aimed to remove coloureds from the common voter’s role as the women of Black Sash believed this action was against the ‘spirit' of the constitution. Though the organisation was established as means to highlight the unconstitutional actions taken by the apartheid government, it became a platform for liberal women to oppose the apartheid policies through  protests,  marches and vigils. The name Black Sash originated from the women’s use of black sashes as a symbol to mourn the death of the constitution.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingKnow how this organization operates internally? Help uscomplete this section!Specializations, Methods and Tools  The organisation currently works in three main areas, rights-based information, education and training, community monitoring, and advocacy in partnership. The Black Sash publishes historical archives and activities from their advice offices and fieldwork activities as part of their educational campaigns. Black Sash has advice offices across the country, including a helpline where the public can ask questions on any matter regarding human rights. Their activities include advocacy work, where they engage government on behalf of communities, as well as  monitoring government action  in terms of ensuring access to rights. Their first advice office was opened in Cape Town during apartheid in an effort to assist victims of apartheid legislation within lawful means. The organisation’s activities continue to help communities across South Africa.  One of the Black Sash's most effect methods of community empowerment has been their unique approach to community-based monitoring.  Developed and piloted  with  Making All Voices Count  and  Code for South America , the  Black Sash CBM model  involves the formation of partnerships with both community-based organisations (CBOs) and government in order to strengthen the role of civil society in improving service delivery and holding public and private sectors to account.  Major Projects and Events  The Black Sash has been involved in a variety of projects, including:  Community Monitoring  and Advocacy, Reproductive Maternal and Child Health projects, and the Making All Voices Count community-based monitoring project to mention a few.Community Monitoring and AdvocacyThe Community Monitoring and Advocacy project was implemented by driven communities through civil society organisations, who supported and trained volunteers as monitors in the project. The project identified the South African Social Security Agency, Department of Health, Department of Home Affairs and municipalities for monitoring.Reproductive Maternal and Child Health ProjectThe purpose of the Reproductive Maternal and Child Health project is to assist government in ensuring access to reproductive healthcare services and improve the quality of service particularly for the poor. The project aims to:Support districts to oversee improvement of MNCH services.  Strengthen delivery of school health, ward-based primary health care, and obstetric and neonatal emergency services.  Improve demand and accountability for MNCH services.  Document and disseminate new knowledge to remove barriers to the uptake and access to MNCH servicesMaking All Voices Count Community-Based MonitoringThe Making All Voices Count project is part of a global initiative which aims to empower Community Based Organisations to take ownership of and participate actively in citizen-based monitoring of three government services in 20 service sites across South Africa.

The goal was advancing the needs of citizens through engagements with government that ensure citizen participation for the promotion of a government that is effective and listens to the people. Ultimately, Making All Voices Count intended to foster changes that allow all people, including the poor and marginalised, to engage with public and private institutions and call them to account over the issues that matter to them most. The organization's projects developed and improved community capacity to encourage the practice of active citizenship that generates results.  Origins and Development  Making All Voices Count was founded in June 2013 with the intent to run for four years. While the organization's activities were officially concluded in 2017, it continues to publish final reports on its work.  Making All Voices Count worked in 12 countries in Africa and Asia, primarily in Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, the Philippines, South Africa, and Tanzania. The program was initiated with a clearly defined set of aims, a theory of change and a structure centred on four linked components – innovation, scaling, research and evidence, and catalysing global action. The programme has carried out activities under each of components.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Making All Voices Count was run by a team of 24 individuals made up from each of its partner organizations:Hivos (an international non-governmental organisation supporting people who are systematically blocked from rights, opportunities and resources), Ushahidi (a group pioneering technology-for-development organisation) and the Institute for Development Studies (a global institution for development research, teaching and learning, and impact and communications, based at the University of Sussex in the UK).  MAVC's organizational team worked out of their partner offices in South Africa, Kenya, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Indonesia.  The organization recieved funding from the Department for International Development (DFID), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) and the Omidyar Network (ON).

Their purpose is to ensure equal access and quality of service. The movement’s aim has been to advance the constitutional rights to life, dignity, equality, freedom and safety for all people, but especially those living in informal settlements across South Africa through actions that ensure that these constitutional rights are enjoyed in practice.History  The Social Justice Coalition was founded in 2008, as a grassroots social movement with branches in various informal settlements, mainly in Khayelitsha, Cape Town. The movement has 14 active branches, 2000 members, and over 60 partner organisations. The Social Justice Coalition promotes active citizenship through education, policy and research, and community organising to ensure that government is accountable, open and responsive. The branches are the movement’s main tool of mobilisation and they also play an educative role.Specializations and activities  The Social Justice Coalition engages in campaigns and programmes aimed achieving a safer environment and improved access to justice and basic services through engagement between government and citizens. The 2014/2015 Social Justice Coalition annual report showed that branch members also organised branch activities such as public debates, sports tournaments, documentary screenings, and drama groups. These activities promote political education and involvement. The movement also holds annual lectures to encourage active citizenship and engagement on issues directly related to people living in poor and working class communities, but to all people livingMajor projects and events  The major projects in the Social Justice Coalition include the Safety and Justice programme. This Program is designed to make Khayelitsha and all of South Africa a safer place where there is improved access to justice and a better working relationship between the police and communities. The programme’s activities involved campaigning to the Western Cape government for the establishment of a Khayelitsha Commission of Enquiry on policing. The Social Justice Coalition led a group of social movements based in Khayelitsha such as the ‘Treatment Action Campaign, Equal Education and Free Gender, supported by Ndifuna Ukwazi and Triangle Project to campaign for the Western Cape government to establish the Commission.  The Social Justice Coalition also has a local government programme aimed at improving government accountability. The movement established a campaign for clean and safe sanitation. The campaign calls for clean and safe sanitation facilities in informal settlements – areas which are disproportionately affected by crime. To this end, the movement has also conducted a social audit of toilets in Khayelitsha’s informal settlements. The Social Justice Coalition has been monitoring ‘Mshengu’ toilets and other service providers for a number of years and continues to identify shortcomings with regard to cleaning and general maintenance. This shows some of the projects the movement has been involved in.External Linkshttp://www.sjc.org.za/about-ushttp://www.internationalbudget.org/wp-content/uploads/Social-Justice-Coalition-Report-of-the-Khayelitsha-Mshengu-Toilet-Social-Audit.pdfhttp://www.sjc.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SJC-Annual-Report-2014-2015.pdfhttp://www.ngopulse.org/event/sjc-third-irene-grootboom-memorial-lecture-series  ",0,0,0,0,0,

 Origins and Development 
 Founded in 2008 by Steve Anderson (Executive Director); headquartered in Vancouver, Canada. 
 Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 In 2014, 70% of their budget was used for campaigns; 20% to operation and administrative costs (rent, legal advice, etc.), and 10% to fundraising costs. 
 Nonprofit organization headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, based on contributions, which in 2014 came from: 
 Individual grassroots donors (58%) 
 Monthly donors gave an average of $10 a month 
 Businesses (29%) 
 Philanthropic contributions and grants (13%) 
 Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 Diffusion of technology policies' impact on users through education and community engagement; advocacy as well as lobbying of Canadian government for open internet and privacy-- against government surveillance and corporate manipulation of content viewing habits. 
 Free Expression (against censorship, interference through governmental ""takedowns"" or content blocking"") 
 Access (universally fast, open, affordable networks) 
 Privacy (open internet meaning free from government surveillance 
 ""Big Telecom"" manipulation of the internet Operating Principles : 
 1 Community collaboration: with network of organizations and people 
 2 Transparency as a means to creating a more collaborative and democratic world 
 3 Be nimble: crowdsource ideas to react at internet-speeds 
 4 Be human: instead of an institution, ""to remind people of the power they have when they collaborate based on shared purpose"" 
 5 Post-partisanship: actively work to put citizens at the center of government decision-making. No political party or orientation owns the Internet—the Internet is a fair, neutral space for dialogue, sharing, and commerce. 
 Major Projects and Events 
 Past campaigns: Save the Net : protecting openness, choice, and access for Canada's Internet. Stop The Meter : against usage-based billing in Canada included an online petition. The petition reached over 500,000 signatures and caused the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to reexamine its decision on the way Canadians are billed for their Internet access. The petition was supported by Canadian Internet service providers affected by the ruling (such as TekSavvy, which sent out invitations to sign to all of their customers), the Liberal Party of Canada, the New Democratic Party and Stephen Harper, who voiced his concerns over Twitter. Fresh Media : a campaign to celebrate innovative and independent media. Vote the Internet : launched as a campaign to ensure that Internet access issues would become a focus for the 2011 Canadian federal election. Citizens were provided with a letter that they could modify and email to candidates in their riding asking them to become ""pro-Internet"". Politicians were then also able to register as pro-Internet candidates through the website. Current campaigns in CanadaKill C51

These and other challenges affect millions of people around the world without many citizens of any age getting involved in facing them.[1] Design for Change is an initiative that seeks to engage people in problem solving in their communities at the school level,  empowering children such that they graduate ""with crucial  21st Century Skills  ofc  ollaboration, critical thinking, creativity, and empathy"", thereby equipping them to face the aforementioned challenges.[2]The initiative responds to the question “How can we help our children develop passion for knowledge and compassion for the world around them? How can make people believe that children are not helpless? That change is possible and they can drive it?”  The direct purpose of Design for Change is to recognize that children are capable of being socially aware and proactive change agents in their community.[3] For that purpose, there is a need to promote a learning environment that focuses on passion and compassion, collaboration, empathetic thinking, problem-solving, and confidence.[4]  The initiative proposes that “to impact a positive transformation in the environment, we need to design solutions with individuals, rather than for them. Design thinking gives us tools and skills that enable us to stop assuming and start engaging, empathizing and understanding. It helps us move from the current-state to a preferred-state – for ourselves as well as for others.”[5] Design for Change “equips children with the tools to be aware of the world around them, believe that they play a role in shaping that world, and take action toward a more desirable, sustainable future.”[6] It teaches children that they do not have to be rich or strong or powerful to make change happen.  Origins and Development  While trying to empower people to manage the challenges their communities face, Kiran Bir Sethi founded ‘The Riverside School’ in Ahmedabad, India, in 2001, and ‘Design for Change’ in 2009. As the initiative explains,  “she started this movement with a conviction that if young people were empowered and made to feel that they could take matters into their hands, they would change the world for the better. Kiran relied heavily on her background as an Industrial Designer to pilot the very first design-thinking guide for young people across India.”[7]  Kiran Bir Sethi narrates that when her 6-year-old son had the word “choice” removed from his vocabulary by a teacher, she began thinking of bringing it back in. In India, while 200 million children go to school, only 18 million go to college from which 90% do not have necessary employment skills. She felt that they had been filled with the feeling of “I can ́t”. So as a designer, she aimed to design an approach to education that would equip children with the tools to be able to say “I can” instead of “I can’t”, founding The Riverside School in Ahmedabad, India in 2001. Within the next ten years, the Riverside School students outperformed the top 10 schools in India. Because it was working for the 350 children that were part of that private school, Kiran Bir Sethi decided to expand it in 2009.[8] From March to June – when they launched it- everything was design on the go and put in very simple guide with four simple steps:  “FEEL any problem that bothers you, IMAGINE a way to make it better, DO an act of change and SHARE your story of change with the world. She believed the Feel-Imagine-Do-Share framework, would help cultivate what’s called the I CAN mindset, a belief that young people are not helpless, that change is possible and they can drive it.”[9]  In the first year, they sent the guide to 30,000 schools on India; then, she had the opportunity to give a TED Talk on the matter and in 2010 it went viral.[10] In 2010, Design for Change expanded worldwide, in countries such as Korea, Australia, Brazil, and Russia. In 2011, the initiative won the INDEX Design to Improve Life Award,[11] and started to get support from Education Experts such as Howard Gardner who said  “It is a simple idea, but is a constructive idea at the same time. We can’t deal with ideas [that are] too complicated, they don’t travel, and so many ideas are self-congratulatory rather than constructive. What I see is that this is wonderful constructive gift to the school, the community, the nation and now many other countries around the world.” [ citation needed ]  In 2012, Design for Change won the Rockefeller Foundation Innovation Award and expanded to have collected 800 stories in India and 4,200 worldwide.[10]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Yearly funding for Design for Change has mostly been from grants or awards from Humanitarian Foundations, including: 2011 Index Awards, Fetzer Institute ,  Rockefeller Foundation ,  The LEGO Foundation ,  Ashoka “Everyone is a change maker” ,  The Chicago Council on Global Affairs, The Commonwealth, and the Asia Society's Asia Game Changer Award.[12] Additionally, partners and collaborators include: “Anybody can jump” a CARE Foundation Initiative, National Institute of Design, Institute of Design at Stanford, IDEO, The Good Project “Ideas and tools for a good life”, World’s largest lessons, DAAN UTSAV, and Claris.[12]  With initiatives in 70+ countries and regions, Design for Change's organization structure varies among its member organizations. However, a core team of designers and educators can be found on the official website. [13]  Run by founder Kiran Bir Sethi until 2018 when Design for Change introduced its first round of board members, the CEO is now lawyer, Monica Canton De Celis Calvo; its all-female board of directors is also available on the website. [14]  An advisory board of education experts was also convened to to guide and provide advice for advancing the global I Can movement.[15]  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The  Design for Change ""Feel, Imagine, Do, Share"" method  is a process of collaborative and creative thinking that enables students to find innovative solutions to problems and challenges that they face every day, either at school or within their community. The solutions can go from designing a machine to improving a social service. This process has empathy as a central concept.[2] When the students start to connect with the problem they want to address, then they begin to understand the situation, and its multiple facets.  The analytical piece of this method comes when the students and teachers engage within the four main steps of the program (Feel, Imagine, Do, Share), examining different perspectives to the problem, and testing solutions. The final goal is to come up with the best package of solutions by integrating the whole community if it is necessary. Thus, Design for Change seeks to promote analytical thinking among students, teachers, communities, and parents. The idea is for them to get a well-founded knowledge of the subject, and stay away from easy and fast solutions. Through fostering creativity, a team can collaboratively begin to design solutions (action plans), and prepare strategies for implementing them.  Major Projects and Events  Design for Change markets its methodology as a “school challenge,” open to anyone - students, communities, schools - who is interested, because Design for Change believes that every child and teenager has the capacity to become a valued and active citizen. Participants in the Design for Change method are thus completely self-selecting. The curriculum is open to children in kindergarten to eighth grade who are accompanied by an adult Design for Change member.[6]  Teachers that decide to use the DFC method receive guidance from Design for Change Worldwide (which has offices in more than 30 countries). It often happens that the method is first known by the students rather than teachers. If this is the case, the children form a group, and then look for a teacher who is willing to accompany them during the whole process of change. On the other hand, Design for Change commits to accompany the mentor (teacher) during the whole process, depending on their needs. In this sense, DFC is a two-way communication between the participants involved. They engage and build a small scale decision-making process to maximize the impact of their efforts beyond the class.  Adult mentors can be teachers, parents, youth leaders, or coaches. Entire countries that participate in Design for Change host a national social change school competition every year and give a deadline near the end of the school year in May. Team projects are evaluated and one team is selected to represent their country at the global Be the Change Conference.[16] This two-day event is an opportunity to collaborate and inspire across borders.  The application of the four step methodology is designed to enable children to think about problem solving in an empathetic way that gets them out into the community. An example of this in action can be seen through the project DCF2012 Singapore: Elderly Cleaners.[17] Students  deliberated  by brainstorming problems to tackle based on what they have observed in their communities. This team felt that elderly cleaners in their school were not respected for the hard work they do. Public participation happened early in the process when they designed a public poll and interviewed strangers in their community. Using their feedback, they developed a campaign to raise awareness about the issue which involved fundraising, a peer-quiz, public speaking, and mind-maps. Ultimately, their project was successful and they could see attitudes positively changing in their school.  “Design for Change” is marketed as a school challenge but it is not a contest. All changes made within schools and communities are valued, shared and imitated all over the world by posting the case on the website, organizing events beyond the school, and adding supporters, such as local governments and private companies. It is often the case that children see what other groups are achieving through this method, and then they want to imitate the project, as well. In the end, the first group ends up leading an initiative that grows to involve many actors within the school community, and even beyond (government, NGOs, IOs, and donors).  Natalia Allende, representative of DFC Chile, notes that their  ""aim as an organization is to challenge the children to become the catalysts of change they want to see in the world...In this context we do not choose the winners, but we have a jury that evaluates each case based on its impact, creativity, and boldness.""[ citation needed ]  Design for Change hosts an annual international meeting called “I Can,” where children and youth across any country share their experiences, celebrate the change and learn more from each other’s stories.[18] In Chile, for instance, the last event gathered the 20 most amazing stories of the country. Again, this instance serves to expose outstanding cases and spread their outcomes throughout the whole Design for Change community and beyond.  The idea behind DFC is to empower society through a methodology that allows it to generate a personal and social transformation. Their creators today are talking of “a global movement that causes a social transformation, and promotes an intersectional collaboration in order to create opportunities that drive citizens to be protagonists of their own development.” [ citation needed ]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Design for Change offers their methodology for free online and in an accessible way to the public. As a result, the method has proved to be easy to follow. More than 70 countries have adopted the program[19] and projects have been on a range of topics, most prominently in the areas of the environment, education, and health.[20] Generally, outcomes have been positive. Problems have been addressed, while students learn empathy, collaboration, communication, and leadership skills.[20] Teachers and students have enhanced their relationship and the community benefits as well. One of the most recent and innovative components of the Design for Change method is the last stage entitled as ""Share"" which Allende suggests ""helps the children to reflect about what has been achieved, and also to inspire their peers to be the change, and do not wait for others to address them.""[ citation needed ]  According to the DFC organization,  “research conducted by The GoodWork Project has reaffirmed the impact of the DFC curriculum on the development of skills like collaboration, creative thinking &amp; empathy. [Ongoing research suggests] that the confidence developed through the project improves academic scores as well."" [4]  PublicationsDoes this organization publish reports, studies, or other media?

 Mission and Purpose 
 The Landless rural Worker's Movement (Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra (MST) in Portuguese) is the largest and most well-known of Brazil's social movements fighting for the reformation of rural working conditions. Through occupations, encampments, marches and rural settlement, the MST has introduced Agrarian Reform into Brazilian policy guidelines, re-invented ways of protest, and established new terms of relation between rural workers and the State. More recently, the movement brought attention to agribusiness and the agro-exporter model which opened up discussions around food sovereignty and the peasant economy's need for a government support structure. 
 The relevance of MST consists not only in its activities, but in its influence upon other brazilian social movements – in the field and in the city – and upon rural movements more generally, especially after its prominent role in the creation and in consolidation of the transnational peasant movement  Via Campesina.The MST is present in 24 Brazilian states and all regions of the country. According to the organization, 350 thousands families have gained control over their land through the MST's efforts. It is estimated that the MST have approximately 1.14 million members, 2 thousand settlements under its control, and representation in 61 cooperatives and 140 agro-industries. Although the agricultural reform movement is often criticized as sporadic and transcient, the MST has played a major role in the distribution of more than 3.7 million hectares of land (as of 2009)iii. 
 Origins and Development 
 When a Brazilian civil-military dictatorship (1964-1985) already showed signs of weakness, rural populations and city populations returned to organize themselves publicly. Part of this scenery, the MST was born in the first decade of 1980, organizing rural populations to fight for the access to the land through agrarian reform. Organized initially in the states of South and south-east of the countryvi 
 Scholars of the MST work with four moments of group territorialization: 1) Gestation (1979-84): begins with land occupations in the South of Brazil and extends until its foundation, in 1984, when occupations start to occur in the Southeast and Midwest too; 2) Consolidation: (1985-89): when the movement gain nacional extent and Brazil back to tread the path of democratization; 3) Institutionalization: from 1990, period wich the MST becames “ the main interlocutor of federal government in relation to agrarian reform and is internationally renowned”vii. Are created new public policies for rural populations, the example of a credit program for family farmers. The MST creates co-operatives, schools, centers of formation and research and organizes its collective, finally, phase 4) Globalization: phase concerning the creation and strengthening of  Via Campesina . viii 
 There are, however, researchers who question certain periodization, arguing that the phases are not static, but overlap. They affirm, for example, that the international ties of the movement are even prior to its official creation in 1984.ix 
 The MST obtained national acknowledgment since the occupations that gave rise to it. In 1981, the support to the encampment in the  Encruzilhada Natalino , in Rio Grande do Sul, gathered more than 600 families, added support from all over the country and became a symbol of the struggle for land in the period of redemocratizationx. Shortly after, there were large occupations in 1990, in the  Pontal do Paranapanema , in São Paulo, which marked actions of the group in the most populous state in the country, and in Pernambuco, 1992, when mill of sugarcane production, in crisis, were taken over by workers, reinventing the occupation of land as a repertoire of action in the region.xi 
 Other crucial moments for the national projection an international of the movement were its national marches in 2005, 1999 and in 1997 – this last one gathered 100 thousand persons in Brasília. The massacre of rural workers in Corumbiara, Rondônia (1995), Eldorado dos Carajás, Pará (1996) e Felisburgo, Minas Gerais (2004) put the movement in national and international press. In those moments, the MST managed to catalyze the feeling of indignation of many people. 
 Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 The organization of MST it’s based on core families living in settlements and camps. Each core family is composed by approximately dozens of families, who choose their coordination. As a result of the gender’s ‘debates, it is established that there is always a pair of coordinators: a man and a womaniv. Camps and settlements hold assemblies periodically, which indicates coordinators for the state instances. The coordination of the state activities is under the responsibility of the state secretariats and the definition of priorities of the State Meetings. 
 There is also a secretariat, a coordination and a national direction. In this sphere , the decisions instances includes the Nacional Congress (which happens, in general, every five years) and the Nacional Meeting (every two years)v. Besides, nowadays the movement organizes in eleven sectors: Training, education, production, gender, health, communication, projects, mass front, human rights, finance and international relations. There are also collectives on cross-cutting themes such as mysticism. 
 The MST finances its activities through contributions from its members, donations from supporters and projects resources, through international and national cooperation. 
 Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 At least until the last decade, the way of action that characterized the activities of the MST was the occupation of land. After the entry of organized groups in areas where the movement like to see expropriated, a camp is set up and intense disputes ensue, usually with evictions and repossession. Sometimes, the camps moved to the edge of the roads. With the repetition of these actions, chiefly in decades of 1980 and 1990, The black tarpaulin tents and the raised flag began to be understood by society with the sign that someone had a search for land. More than that, the ""camp form"" became the ""appropriate way"" to demand land in Brazilxii, because the Brazilian State eventually accepted it, adapted its bureaucracy to this format and organized its agrarian reform action tied to the Demands of social movements. It was then imitated by other social movements, the country side and, later, also the city. 
 When there is agreement about the possibility of expropriate areas – and financial resources – the State responds to the pressures of the movement, legitimizing them. However, it does not always expropriate the areas in question and sometimes installs settlements in places far from the requested, of the consuming markets and of the infrastructure – for example, in the North region of the country, where there are still larger stretches of public land available. 
 The relations between MST and Brazilian state are important issues, focus of much reflection and controversy: where some authors see mainly conflictxiii, others see also cooperation and interdependencexiv or until the emergence of an unlikely participatory democracyxv. The MST, in general, affirms see the state as a place dominated by economic elites, aimed to follow their interests – that, in countryside, were summarized in the figures of the landowners, up to the beginning of the 21st century and in agribusiness, from then on. What that the movement can do is to contest the hegemony of the state (and, at long term, fight for deeper transformation processes)xvi. In view of the reduced access to resources by poor people, the possible action is the public confrontation, of mass. 
 This understanding have important impacts on how the MST thinks about institutional political participation. The movement resists to employ the time of its militants in activities related to participatory institutionsxvii, as it identifies little potential for transformation. Still during the government of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, when was created a national program of credit for family farmers – the  Pronaf–  which led to the installation of municipal councils of territorial development, the MST do not occupied such spaces institutionally, concerned in maintaining autonomy and avoid co-optation. Despite this, local associations linked to the movement participated in certain periods, in some municipalities, and were responsible for important discussions around the democratization of the practices of these councilsxviii . 
 This stance has been maintained in the years of the Workers' Party (PT) since 2003, when institutional participation spaces have multiplied. The option by the institutional participation happen only occasionally played by some sectors of the movement. The health sector of MST, for example, has been walked in that direction - at this time (2015) substitute on the National Health Council and has representation on the group of Land, which discusses the policy for populations in the field. Until today, the MST doesn’t participates of National Council of Sustainable and Solidary Rural Development (Condraf). During the governments of PT, due to greater policy identification with the party in power, the MST has more access to managers, having even participated of indications for positions of second-tier.xix There are authors who points to a change in strategies of fight against the movement, (as well as in other Brazilian social movements), which would have reduced the emphasis on actions of protestxx and would, therefore, modifying their repertoires of action in this new period. 
 Recently, in 2014, João Pedro Stedile, one of the national coordinators of the MST, signed a letter alongside researchers and jurists defending the National Policy on Social Participation proposed by President Dilma Rousseff. Decree 8.243 / 2014, which established mechanisms for social participation in public administration, was questioned by sectors of Brazilian society, with wide repercussions in the media. 
 Major Projects and Events 
 For the MST ,  “the conquering of the land it is only the first step for the accomplishment of Agrarian Reform”, since it brings demands for installation, in the settlements, of public services which are not used to be extended to rural populations - such as energy, water, education, health, culture and leisure. 
 In addition to the public policies, the MST has been developing its own practices in several areas. In health, developments activities of rescue and valorization of traditional knowledge and maintain cooperation programs for training popular doctors with Cuba. In education, discusses policies for education in the field and proposes pedagogical practices such as the alternation between periods in the settlements and schools, seeking to prevent the removal of youth from their communities; Created the National School Florestan Fernandes, space of training of militants. The MST has raised flags also on combating violence sexist, democratization of communication, development, ethnic and culture diversity. Involves and sometimes leads debates on the political system, national and popular sovereignty and what calls construction and a Popular Project for Brazil, alongside other social movements.

 Peasants, small and medium rural producers, countryside workers, people without land, indigenous and afro-descendantsi of 73 countries gather in Via Campesina, an international movement created to focus on global policies relating to agriculture - that affect small producers and tend to be developed without effective consultation to these populations. Currently, the 164 organizations that are part of the Via Campesina project themselves in discussions about global food production and nourishment of populations with critical discourse to multinational companies and agribusiness. They defend agrarian reforms in several countries, they propose that peasants and small farmers prioritize the agroecological agriculture, rejecting the use of agrochemicals and genetically modified seeds. For the Via Campesina, its farmers are guardians of diversity of seeds on the planet. 
 Since 1996, La Via Campesina defends the concept of food sovereignty in opposition to food security, employed by governments and international organizations. Ever since, the idea of food sovereignty has spread over social movements around the globe. It has even been included in the reformed constitutions of countries such as Nepal and Bolivia. 
 Currently (2015), this transnational organization is organized in nine regions: Africa 1 (countries in the South of the continent), Africa 2 (North West African), North America, South America, Central America, Caribbean, Europe, South Asia, Southwest and East Asiaiv. Each region holds periodical assemblies where regional representatives are chosen. Together, those regional representatives form the International Coordinating Commission. Activists from all nine regions meet every four years in the global assemblies to define political priorities and strategies. Prior to the general assemblies, there are woman’s assemblies (since 2000) and youth assemblies (since 2004).. 
 Keep Meeting groups of origins, socioeconomic profiles and different policy orientations is one of the major challenges to Via Campesina. The meetings of its members - at national, regional and global levels, at meetings in protest and in international meetings of which participate - are critical moments to advance in the understanding of the different realities and build unity, what is needed to reach agreements on priorities and strategies for common actionv. By aggregating actors and actresses are so diverse, Via Campesina has reformulated the concept of peasantry and contributing to its international projection as a category of political action. By aggregating actors and actresses are so diverse, Via Campesina has reformulated the concept of peasantry and contributing to its international projection as a category of political action. 
 Origins and Development 
 Rural movements build international coalitions since the end of the 19th century, connected either to communist internationalism, pacifism or by feminism. In the Americas and Europe, since the 1960s there were strong links through networks of solidarity and resistance to dictatorships of the period, with exchanges between rural activists. 
 Transnationals actions intensified since the mid 1980s, when supranational institutions have gained strength and agriculture was included in discussions about agreements of free trade. In the early 1990s, one of the major themes was the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT, which defines tariffs, subsides and rules for foreign trade). In South America, campaigns - such as marked the 500 years of indigenous, black and peasant resistance - were also reasons for joint activities.vi 
 Via Campesina was born in 1993, questioning the redefinitions of agricultural policies and national legislation that were in progress, promoted by national governments and international institutions.vii 
 Three years after its foundation, the Via Campesina was already a relevant political actor in the World Food Summit (CMA) promoted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in 1996. Shortly after, the activists of caps, t-shirts and green flags of Via Campesina gave volume to the marches against neoliberal globalization, performed in parallel with meetings of governments in the cities of Geneva (1998), Seattle (1999), Cancun (2003) e Hong Kong (2005), among others. Since the beginning of the 2000s, Via Campesina and its member organizations were part of the Social Forums In The World (FSM).viii 
 One of its main slogans, ""Globalize the struggle, globalize hope"", is directly connected to the 'another world is possible' principles of the World Social Forum. Among its victories include the return of the debate on agrarian reform in forums such as the FAO conference in 1995 and the global agenda (p.207), the damage in the rounds of Uruguay and the Millennium on trade, restrictions on trade in genetically modified seeds in some countries.ix 
 In the 21st century, the speech and the actions of Via Campesina turned to criticism of global crises - food, energy, ethical, social, economic and financial, climate, - placing them as a product of the capitalism system and neoliberalism. Gained strength also debates about the climate. For both, the food sovereignty continues to be considered as part of the possible solutions and necessary for the various crises. 
 Via Campesina claims and actualizes the left internationalist tradition, in opposition to the expansion of the capitalist economy for agriculture. For some researchers, the Via builds an ""alternative project of society which raises questions about the model of production, in particular in rural areas”.x 
 Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 Resources for Via Campesina come from its affiliated organizations, from international cooperation projects and from individual supporters. 
 Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 Among the actions of Via Campesina, there are protests, marches, direct actions, but also the participation and incidence in forums and international institutions, activities to promote solidarity and international cooperation. Sometimes such strategies are used together; Other times, are employed separately. 
 The activities of solidarity and cooperation include international projects and exchanges among farmers about forms of agricultural work and political organization. It has also created a network of solidarity capable of giving answers to violent acts by means of the international projection of debates and problems, and to give visibility to local struggles that develop around the world, connecting them into a global movement. 
 The alternation between protest actions and participation in discussions - in meetings, councils, conferences - has already been the subject of some research on the Via Campesina. Participation, for the group, there is not a term related only to the dialog and changes in the ways of acting of international organizations, but also to attempts to co-opt, of the manufacture of consensus and the legitimacy of the actors. 
 Besides, when LVC does not identify real chances to interfere on debates, they prefer to express their ideas outside the meetings instead of sitting in negotiation tables that could endorse actors whose legitimacy LVC questions. This is what happens with the discussions of the World Trade Organization. Because it does not recognize the legitimacy of the OMC to address the issue, it chooses to stay out of the negotiations.xi More than that, the Via Campesina argues that the subject of agriculture is withdrawn from discussions of this organization, and makes criticism of the lack of transparency and rendering of accounts, considering their practices, including, antidemocratic.xii In general, international financial institutions are ""considered [by Via Campesina] key elements of neoliberalism and the destruction of peasant agriculture"". xiii 
 In relation to other international organizations linked to the UN system, however, the stance may be different, since the group consider possible advance negotiations internally - even in these cases, the group does not dispense from criticism and even actions of mobilization, giving strength to criticism as one who, in the face of the World Summit about Food, in 1996, said that it would not be possible to solve world hunger without the participation of those who cultivate the land. xiv Almost ten years after, in 2004, LVC denounced FAO's reports that supported genetically modified and terminator seeds as alternatives for the needs of the rural poor. By that time, FAO was called “guardian of the capitalism”. xv 
 In the UN Human Rights Council, Via Campesina has discussed the proposal for a ""Declaration of the rights of peasants and other people working in the rural environment"" and an ""International Convention of the Rights Farmers"", which may deal with issues such as the right to land, the identity and culture and, unlike other international instruments already conquered, have binding for States that sign it. xvi 
 Major Projects and Events 
 The concept of food sovereignty is part of the discourse of Via Campesina since their second meeting, held in Tlaxcala, Mexico (1996). With the passing of the years, the concept gained space between the movements connected to Via nd beyond them. In the Declaration of the Assembly of Jakarta, Indonesia, 2013, Food Sovereignty was defined as: 
 “a key part of the fight for social justice bringing together many sectors from the countryside and the city. Food sovereignty is the fundamental right of all peoples, nations and states to control food and agricultural systems and policies, ensuring every one has adequate, affordable, nutritious and culturally appropriate food. This requires the right to define and control our methods of production, transformation, distribution both at the local and international levels.” 
 Some of the main themes discussed by La Via Campesina - and summarised in the letters of their six meetings, between 1993 and 2013, are: 
 - the defense of the importance of peasant agriculture to eliminate poverty, hunger, unemployment and marginalization, whose development can even help to ""cool the planet"", contributing to the fight against climate crisis (SP). The farmers feed humanity and take care of nature. 
 - critique of capitalism, to neoliberalism, into aggressive speculative capital and finance in agriculture, configuring a industrial agriculture that takes away the peasants from the land. For the group, speculative capital should not be able to focus on the production of food. Via Campesina rejects the Green Economy and transnational corporations that, in its understanding, acting in collusion with national governments and international institutions. 
 - Protection of seed and concern with the appropriation of their genetic resources by multinational companies. 
 - the women of Via Campesina are organized since the first years of the group and held their first meeting in Bangalore, in the year 2000. At the 2008 assembly, they proposed gender parity as a goal for the movement. The 3rd Assembly of Women in 2013 emphasized the need to overcome violence against women in its various forms: physical, economic, social, sexist, power and cultural differences. They affirm that there is ""an intimate relationship between capitalism, patriarchy, sexism and neoliberalism"". Rural communities and organizations are not free from these problems, which have been brought to the movement and need to be overcome. The Declaration of Jakarta (2013 Assembly) argues ""a world without violence and discrimination against women."" 
 - The youth of Via Campesina held their 1st World Assembly in 2004. The movement has been discussing the incorporation of peasant youth in their activities and alternatives for staying in youth in the countryside. 
 Many events mark the route of the Via Campesina. The group was gathered in his second assembly in Mexico when it received news of the murder of 23 Brazilian peasants, known as the Eldorado dos Carajás (Pará) massacre, on April 17, 1996. The date has passed, then, to be considered ""International Day of Peasant struggles"". Every September 10, the group carries out activities of the ""International Day of protest to the World Trade Organization"", recalling the day on which the Korean Lee Kyuong-Hae committed suicide (sacrificed, in terms of Via Campesina) with the phrase ""WTO(OMC) kills peasants"" during a protest in Cancun, Mexico. Other important moments are the realization of the Global Campaign for Agrarian Reform and the implementation of the World Forum for Agrarian Reform in Valencia, Spain, in 2004. In 2007, Mali received the International Forum on Food Sovereignty in Nyéléni, with intense participation of women. 
 The years from 2006 to 2008 were marked by activities of direct action questioning transnational corporations. In France, a hunger strike contributed to Monsanto's prohibition on planting transgenic maize, while in Brazil protests against transnational company Syngenta led to the tragical murder of an MST activist named Keno. Shortly after, the same company had to close an area used for experiments with genetically modified organisms.xvii

Origins and Development  Located in California, Without My Consent was co-founded by lawyers Colette Vogele (President), a fellow at the Center for Internet and Society and an attorney at Microsoft, and Erica Johnstone (Vice President), name partner of law firm Ridder, Costa, and Johnstone LLP, in San Francisco. The organization was started in 2011  after these two lawyers sued online trolls on behalf of three clients successfully using lawsuits filed anonymously to prevent continued unwanted attention towards the victim of a privacy violation. The organization's foundation and initial work was supported by the  Samuelson Law, Technology &amp; Public Policy Clinic at UC Berkeley School of Law , the  Fenwick &amp; West law firm,  Stanford's Center for Internet and Society , and financially supported by  donations from a fundraising effort . It specializes in providing information on anonymous lawsuits given they are scarcely used.  Organizational Structure and Funding  Public fundraising efforts were made in 2012 through a panel event, in San Francisco with a donation goal of 10,000 USD, and in 2016 Peerlyst teamed up to donate 10USD to the organization when each user signed up to their service during the RSA Conference.  In 2015 Without My Consent also obtained a Digital Trust Foundation grant for the 50-State Project, the Something Can Be Done! guide and a lawyer training program.  990 tax filings show total revenues of:  $ 53,164 for 2015 [1], $ 121,334 for 2016[2], and $67,912 for 2017 [3].  Specializations, Methods and ToolsAdvisors  from academia, legal and government practitioners, internet and privacy activists and experts collaborate on three large projects surrounding harassment, abuse, and exploitation online. The organization primarily focusses on public information campaigns and increasing access to legal help for those who have experienced online harassment or abuse. The organization also does it's own research and analysis of online harassment in order to collaborate on solutions.  Major Projects and Events  One of the projects is an ongoing compilation of  current US state laws . As of August 2016 it contains information for California, Florida, Kentucky, Nevada, New York, Texas, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. For each state, information on statutory civil law, common law, restraining orders, family law, statutory criminal law is posted with easy to understand interpretation of the law and grounded with legal precedents closely tied to unwilling publication of personal images and harassment. Furthermore, federal Statutory Civil Law and federal Statutory Criminal Law is provided. Case law, filing requirements and relevant statutes for all 50 US States and federal guidelines for civil and criminal proceedings filled pseudonymously are also explained  in detail .  The second project is a guide geared at informing victims and legislators about appropriate steps for  evidence protection , through their  document  Something Can Be Done! Resource Guide for Victims of Digital Abuse &amp; Harassment, published March 1, 2016. It details how to  approach and access legal advice  that protects victims through  pseudonymous lawsuits  and  copyright protection  using take-down notices and copyright registration, as well as  evidence preservation .  The third project is a victim  survey on online stalking, harassment and privacy violations from July 2013 to February 2014.  Preliminary findings  suggest the majority of respondents experienced multiple episodes of harassment from multiple harassers (46.6%), and 71% reported that their harassment influenced their use of technology (p. 12 of report). The report also details what measures victims took to try to put an end to their harassment.  Without My Consent has been profiled in the  New York Times Magazine , the  This Week in Law podcast , and  Forbes . It also had two panels at the South By Southwest Interactive conference in Austin in March 2012:  Debate: Should Social Sites Allow Anonymous Users? with Electronic Frontier Foundation's legal director Cindy Cohn, and the  Help! I Have An Internet Stalker or Blackmailer! panel.  Since Without My Consent was established,  Twitter has changed its harassment policies ,  Google decided to remove sexually explicit images shared without consent  and Microsoft's  Bing search adopted reporting mechanisms for revenge porn .

Please help us complete it.Mission and Purpose  21st Century Dialogue is based in the state of Western Australia. The organisation's approach is rooted in the normative principles of deliberative and participatory democracy. It draws on a number of methods to develop its own  methodology .  21st Century Dialogue aims to create processes that are:inclusive (representative of the population and inclusive of groups who are often not heard);  deliberative (opportunities for informed discussion, small group dialogue - speaking and listening to all views -, to find alternatives and seek common ground); and  influential (has the capacity to influence policy development or decision making)HistoryThe following is taken from 21st Century Dialogue's website and outlines the development of their approach:The 21st Century Dialogue methodology has been adapted from 21st Century Town Meetings -large-scale public participation processes, originally developed in the USA by AmericaSpeaks and applied across the USA, including with nearly 5,000 residents after September 11 to plan for the future of the Ground Zero site in New York; and more recently at the World Economic Forum Meeting at Davos in Switzerland with 700 of the world’s political, economic and social leaders.  This engagement process uses small group, facilitated deliberation together with networked computer technology, to enable the room’s key themes to be broadcast to the entire room virtually in ‘real time’. At each table, ideas are submitted to the computer including individual, team and strongly held minority views. Table inputs are relayed to a theme team who synthesise the results and display them to the room on large screens. Key issues are prioritised, with each participant nominating their individual preferences. Preferential rakings in the form of a histogram are projected back into the room in ‘real time’. At the conclusion of the forum, each participant is given a Preliminary Report of the outcomes of the forum.  The consultants from 21st Century Dialogue have developed their own technology – software and networked computers – as well as the interactive group dynamics system to suit Australian requirements. They have carried out this format for Dialogue with the City (1,100 participants), Dialogue with the Pilbara: Newman 2020 (120 participants); Port Hedland Enquiry by Design (140 participants), Dialogue with Bunbury (300 participants) and Cockburn Vision Dialogue (200 participants). Dr Janette Hartz-Karp will continue with the role of designing, coordinating and lead facilitating. Les Buchanan, will continue in the role of controlling the event management. David Bruce, will continue with the design and analysis of the survey methodologies. The 21st Century Dialogue computer technology has been tried and tested on many occasions, and the computing consultant, Leor Karp will continue to provide the computing support.Organizational Structure and Funding  21st Century Dialogue describes itself as ""a boutique business"" and, as such, employs just four people - David Bruce, Les Buchanan, Leor Karp - with leadership from the well-known scholar and deliberative practitioner, Dr Janette Hartz-Karp. They are a for-profit consulting firm.  Specializations and Activities21st Century Dialogue's methodology  combines a range of established methods including:"" Consensus Forums  – which ensure that participation is representative of the population, there is informed deliberation and in-depth dialogue, and the initiative has the capacity to influence policy development and decision-making.21st Century Town Meetings  – with custom developed computer software that is unique, reliable and flexible, training of support personnel that is targeted and effective, and agendas that deliver the outcomes set at the commencement of the engagement.Community Surveys  - that are statistically rigorous, creatively discern people’s attitudes and values, and reported in a user-friendly style.  Event management - that is customer focussed, efficient and flexible.""Major Projects and Events  21st Century Dialogue has been involved with a wide range of engagement activities and deliberative processes in Western Australia in the past 15 years. Case studies of their initiative can be found at  https://goo.gl/fv1rF3Their website includes an index of previous initiatives which each have a detailed outline available.

Today its work spans a multipronged agenda targeted to the realisation of its Vision of Consumer Sovereigntyí and its Mission of consumer sovereignty in the framework of social justice, economic equality and environmental necessity, within and across borders. In simple language, the Vision relates to the creation of Value for People in their diverse roles as consumers, producers and depositors/suppliers of human capital. As every citizen in an economy performs more than one and sometimes all these roles simultaneously, such creation of value should be looked upon as a single unified Vision for achieving greater Consumer Welfare through Consumer Empowerment.""

Towards this goal, some on-going projects at the T2F include Faraar, a visual arts gallery to promote local talent and social change through art, Science ka Adda, a platform for debate on the role and influence of science on our lives, Urdu Preservation Project, an archival project for urdu poetry and prose, and Raahnuma, an online resource for victims of violence and abuse.History  Though article 19 of Pakistan’s constitution guarantees freedom of speech, the country has a notorious reputation for censorship against any voices that contest the power and legitimacy of Islam, the military and the ruling Government. Individuals, groups and members of civil society are often faced with material, epistemic and social threats to expressing, developing and publishing voices on social justice issues such as violence against religious minorities, missing and murdered Balochistani activists and academics and gendered violence.  The Second Floor Café (T2F) was inspired by the revolutionary roots of the Pak Tea House in Lahore; it is the first of its kind in the nation, and has inspired many other café/community spaces to open up from Lahore to Lyari.Origanizational Structure and Funding  PeaceNiche and T2F were founded by Sabeen Mahmud, a local and global activist, graphic designer/tech consultant, human rights advocate from Karachi who was murdered by an armed gunman on April 24 2015 after hosting the seminar “Unsilencing Balochistan”.  Self-defined as a social entrepreneurship project, T2F relies on participation from local artists, activists, thought leaders and engaged audiences to revitalize Karachi’s cultural and political landscapes by offering an alternative and space for discourse.It is funded as a branch of the PeaceNiche project, a not-for-profit organization in Karachi, Pakistan founded in hopes of creating a space for rational, creative and critical dialogue to counter growing religion-based violence, corruption, mafia-presence and extremism in Karachi. Though initially ran out of Mahmud’s own pockets, after relocating to a donated rent-free space, maintenance and salaries are covered through different grants. The café now operates on an honour code, where some individuals pay nothing and others donate generously.  The café has an open door, open mind policy and has hosted people from all walks of life willing to participate in democratic dialogue from students, elders, exiled leaders from skype, interfaith representatives, security and military professionals.  Specialization and Activities  T2F has and continues to provide space for local social movements and activists targeted by land mafias, the military and government such as Citizens Campaign to Reclaim Karachi and Balochi activist Mama Qadeer.  What separates T2F from other not-for-profits is its specific focus on developing civil society for the sake of building capacities for democracy through the relationships between citizens, especially relationships with marginalized members and voices in Pakistani society. This has democratic value in and of itself, building trust and solidarity between and across sectarian, ethnic and regional differences for more effective coalitional critiques against the state violence and corruption. Unlike in other countries, because of Pakistan’s, and especially Karachi’s, security situation, the cultural, artsy and critical nature of T2Fs activities have not only a democratic function but also, a revolutionary aim to reclaim the city from the hands of the land mafia, the corrupt political parties and feudalist strife. One issue with the project is that because of the security situation, the activities and events are not broadcasted, publicized on a large national or even media scale. With the murder of the founder Sabeen Mahmud, the organization has a lot of political enemies/critics whose gaze must be avoided by the project. And so, most of its activities and their influence stays within a very local, off-the-radar, and directly in response to local communities of Karachi. Though its influence and capacity for social change may not directly bring about democratic social change at the level of the state, the café is a space for cultural preservation and building agentic capacities through awareness/education, a place to retreat to from the violence, to become stronger for the tougher political landscapes and climates outside, and to-come.  Major Projects and Events  The multi-purpose café functions as a medium for mobilizing political resources, a community space for dialogue and deliberation and finally, as a site for preserving the intellectual and critical strain of Islamic and Pakistani traditions. The events hosted include everything from workshops/seminars on sectarian violence, state violence against and upon Balochistan, critiquing the blasphemy laws, critical and interfaith religious studies to stand up comedy and open mic shows. One event which illustrates how the café mobilizes community members to solve civic problems is the Civic Hackathon in which developers, urban cartographers, data analysts, and designers/developers gathered to create web and mobile solutions to Pakistan’s civic issues such as crime mapping to emergency services, disaster relief, and improving quality of education. Other programs include Philosophy 101, Traditional Music Preservation series and Zambeel Dramatic Reading group.

Its founders Eyal Halamish and Matthew Gordon, together with friends, designed an online community engagement platform to do just this. Perhaps most importantly, OurSay envisage community engagement as a reciprocal process and the platform facilitates two way communication between communities and decision makers.We want to ensure that in today's digital and social world, both decision makers and their communitiesare able to proactively engage with each other to make the relevant decisions  (OurSay 2016)  History  OurSay is based in Melbourne, Australia. Its two key founders were motivated 'to do something about the lack of trust and authenticity in government decision making' (OurSay 2016). In an effort to address this huge challenge, a founding group designed an online platform through which communities and decision-makers can engage in a meaningful way.  The platform's debut was during the 2010 federal elections in Australia. Members of the public were able to pose questions to candidates, and other users then voted for their top questions. OurSay aims to provide prior commitments from politicians to provide responses to the top questions.Since its inception the organisation has attracted a large membership and involvement from some senior Australian politicians including Premier Julia Gillard in 2012.Specializations and activities  OurSay's main speciality is its online forum platform, which encompasses the following elements:the forum: the online space dedicated to discussing a particular topic or project that has been set up. OurSay work with governments and local councils to set up forums on various issues, such as  Hepburn Shire's Council Plan . Each forum usually lasts for around 3-4 weeks and has a 'forum leader' (the decision maker or organisation) who commits to answering the most popular questions.  questions: participants in a forum can post a question, as many as they like. They are encouraged to 'campaign' for their question through posting on social media and engaging with networks of friends, colleagues and so on.  voting: each forum participant is allocated 7 votes. They can use these votes as they like to vote for the questions they most want answers to.  responses: once the forum has closed, the forum leader will provide a response. This is not just posting a written response; they could respond through a media interview or webcast, or through a live 'response event' at a meeting or public event. All responses are recorded by OurSay and posted on the forum.OurSay also provide a variety of other  online engagement products and services .  Major projects and events  In 2012 the then Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard agreed to answer three questions chosen by Australian citizens through OurSay. She responded to the winning questions through a  Google Hangout  which was broadcast by OurSay. 2,057 questions received over a hundred thousand votes with the winning questions covering same-sex marriage, military pensions and the government-funded school chaplaincy program.In 2013  OurSay partnered with Hepburn Shire Council  in Victoria to create a four year plan for the area with extensive community engagement. In this case, community members were able to pitch an idea for the Shire and the top ten voted ideas were discussed in person at a meeting with councillors, staff and the community.  Funding  OurSay is a social enterprise organisation. It is indepedent and non-partisan. At the time of writing it could not be determined whether OurSay is a for-profit or non-profit business.The enterprise was started up with a $10,000 gift in 2009 (OurSay 2016).

Origins and Development  Under General Zia UL Haq’s rule and Islamization of the nation state, a group of women met in Shirkat Gah Karachi in 1981 and formed the Women Action Forum (WAF) to challenge and protest the Hudood Ordinances of 1979. What inspired this group into creation was the Zina Ordinance’s application to the case of Fehmida and Allah Bux which conflated adultery with rape. Within months of its founding, chapters of WAF opened up in Lahore, Islamabad, and Peshawar.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Membership was once mostly women from elite, upper class families, it now includes women from different backgrounds, in different regions.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  WAF was the face of feminism in Pakistan in the 80s, with picketing, demonstrations, processions, rallies, signature campaigns, consciousness-raising, telegrams, and writing memorandums and letters as their forms of protest and contestation.

Analysis and Lessons Learned  As one of the first organizations to apologize to Bangladeshi women for the crimes against humanity from the 1971 war, to deliberatively deciding to advocate for a secular, democratic nation state, WAF is an intersectional, inclusive and feminist organization. WAF is known as one of the last remaining autonomous, political and women’s rights organizations in Pakistan that has not been hijacked by the neoliberal development agenda. Paid-rights activism, especially when it comes to women’s development, is becoming heavily critiqued in Pakistan.

Collective groups of citizens are as able, if not more able, to develop good policy responses to complex issues as anybody else; when they have the information and time required to consider problems, weigh up options and propose solutions.  Ppromote independence – participants need to be allowed to seek their own information / advice and come to their own conclusions without coercion or undue influence. This is the only way that their work will be trusted.  Have meaning – giving citizens’ the ability to have influence means committing at the start of a process to implementing some or all of what they decide. democracyCo require this for every project they undertake.  Are citizen centred – democracyCo design all of their processes for everyday citizens. They are accessible, enjoyable and also 'stretching' – as they know that when designed for citizens, deliberative processes will deliver what they need to. democracyCo also want people to enjoy this way of working, so they will demand more of it is done.democracyCo have built a reputation for their commitment to the above principles, meaning their work is often complex, balancing many competing interests. However, according to Emily and Emma, it is their adherence to these principles that drives their love of public engagement and deliberation.  Origins and Development  democracyCo was born out of a frustration that governments’ were not achieving quality reform that was able to address the scale and complexity of the problems faced by our communities.  Their experiences in recent years have also revealed that communities are not trusting of decisions made by governments, nor by the way in which they are made. democracyCo recognise that this is not unique to Australia, and have watched with concern how thriving democracies around the world have become susceptible to this trend.  This encouraged democracyCo to create a business which is unique in every way. democracyCo is owned by Emily Jenke and Emma Fletcher and operates as a commercial entity. democracyCo deliberately does not align themselves with issues, nor do they promote agendas. Instead they work with any government, of any persuasion who wants to reform alongside their citizens. As a duo, Emily and Emma use their combined skills in deliberative techniques, policy making and group facilitation to bring governments and the communities they serve closer together.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  DemocracyCo is headed up by co-founders Emily Jenke, and Emma Fletcher. Emma has extensive experience working in and with government and led the  Better Together policy in South Australia , which spearheaded meaningful, embedded engagement with communities in government decision-making in SA. The initiative has received praise worldwide and been recognised in international awards.  Emily Jenke has almost 20 years experience as a facilitator and practitioner in engagement. She also has extensive experience working with government and has worked with the SA government on previous engagement initiatives. Emily was also instrumental in the  Reforming Democracy policy  in South Australia and delivers the governments  Better Together suite of training programs.  democracyCo are a for profit business trading as a company and do not accept donations.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  DemocracyCo provides reform services to Governments to bring about enduring change and improvement in citizens' lives.  DemocracyCo are specialists in developing deliberative strategies to approach reform. This is informed by the recognition that there is no point in having a deliberative process if in reality, the decision has already been made. They do not advocate a single methodology but use a variety of techniques suiting the circumstances. They follow a co-creation process with clients and stakeholder to design strategies and processes together.  Democracy Co facilitate deliberative processes from start to finish - all over Australia and internationally. They have extensive expertise in facilitation and managing group dynamics.  Major Projects and EventsPeople's Policy    democracyCo are the creators of the  Peoples' Policy  method - which aims to put citizens at the very centre of the policy making process. In late 2017 democracyCo ran the first pilot:  Peoples' Policy on Childrens' Wellbeing . democracyCo offer training in this ground breaking method.Citizens' JuriesDemocracy Co have conducted all major South Australian CJs which are also featured on Participedia; one was about  how to reduce the number of unwanted pets , and one on  sharing the roads safely  between road users. They also facilitated the South Australian  Citizens' Jury on nuclear waste storage . In 2018, democracyCo designed and ran the  Citizens Jury on Compulsory Third Party Insurance for the ACT Government  in Canberra.Deliberative PanelsThey have also run many deliberative panels in SA to support reform - on energy and power pricing, community-based sentencing, community engagement in planning, and one in Canberra to develop a strategy for Carers in the ACT.  Democracy Co have undertaken a range of other projects including training &amp; community engagement policy design. democracyCo also undertake their own recruitment for their processes ensuring an end-to-end designed process for citizens.

The association self-identifies as a nationally-organized resistance to the arbitrary eviction and force homelessness of the urban poor, displaced persons and ethnic/religious minorities. It also advocates for affordable housing for low-income families. Its workers do consciousness-raising and provide social, political and legal education and facilitate peaceful mobilization for housing and land reformOrigins and DevelopmentDue to the rise in post-conflict migration, unprecedented degree of economic growth and increase in poverty, informal living arrangments of more than 40 homes named katchi abadis are expanding in Pakistan's major cities. The settlements are homes to the most marginalized, economically and socially, members of Pakistani society from ethnic minorities to low-income families. The communities house mostly workers who provide critical labour to local economies but are undervalued, underpaid and denied basic rights to shelter, fair wages, water and education. The livelihoods of the residents is under constant arbitrary threat by state violence and evictions.  The National Housing Policy 2001 demands that existing katchi abadis be regularized and upgraded, the dwellers be granted ownership rights of the land they occupy and the Capital Development Authority provide basic services of water, electricity and gas. However, the CDA only recognizes 10 settlements as of yet and continues to ignore the no-eviction clause of the 2001 Housing PolicyOrganizational Structure, Membership, and FundingIts activities are funded by donors and local supporters of the Awami Workers' Party.Specializations, Methods and ToolsThe association works with over 14 katchi abadis, with a population of over 150,000 in the nation's capital, Islamabad, in coalition with the Awami Workers' Party. The association works to: 1)consciousness/awareness raising, 2)organization, 3)facilitate communication and dialogue and 4)influence decision-making at local and national levels.Major Projects and EventsAccording to their official Facebook Page, the APKAA is involved in the following activities:  1) Organize regular meetings,  organizes regular meetings, discussions and work sessions with groups of men and women in different abadis that focus on the following activities:  ""a. Disseminating information about past and present government policies, actions and initiatives.  b. Dialogue about the economic, social and political power structures that exist in the country and beyond.  c. Raising awareness about the political and legal rights of the abadi residents, as slum-dwellers and citizens of Pakistan.  d. Outlining the need for peaceful social, political and community organization beyond religious, sectarian, ethnic and gender differences.""  2) The organization also helps residents strenghten existing forms of community organization to contest illegal attempts of eviction by building a ""sustainable organizational structure for the future defense of their rights and positioning of their lawful demands"". APKAA works to create dialogue between abadi residents, civil society, students, academics and other social movements by creating spaces for discussion, joint-lobbying strategies and mobilization.  3)APKAA has a special commitment to strenghtening the abilities of youth and women's groups to use means of communication to express themselves and disseminate information such as wall painting, informative pamphlets and social media technologies.  4)The association seeks to influence government decision-making through protests, organized demonstrations and legal claims. Its current agenda involves organizing a rally on land rights in conversation with the Supreme Court's hearing on the Awami Workers' Party's petition' for a judicial review on previous rulings of land reform. This is a coalitional effort between katchi abadi residents of Islamabad and the landless farmers of Punjab.  The next few years for the organization will consist of entering local and provincial politics through the electoral system in hopes of amplifying voices that represent the needs of the Pakistan's poorest.Analysis and Lessons LearnedPublicationsSee AlsoReferencesExternal Linkshttps://www.facebook.com/AllianceforKachiAbadis/info?tab=page_infohttp://www.dawn.com/news/1275518http://awamiworkersparty.org/campaigns/katchi-abadi-timeline/Notes",1,0,0,0,0,

Still Moon actively encourages and facilitates participation, interaction, and engagement around issues of environmental sustainability, artistic and cultural heritage, and community wellbeing. Their vision is ""a Still Creek neighbourhood where people live as part of a healthy ecosystem and participate in a community where the arts thrive.""[1]  Origins and Development  The Still Moon Arts Society was established by Terry Taylor in 2004. The Society’s founding corresponded with the increased urbanization around and degradation of  Still Creek  in the Renfrew Ravine and the beginning action-phase of the 2002 “Still Creek Rehabilitation and Enhancement Study” commissioned by the City of Vancouver. The Society was instrumental in securing community members a seat at the table during in the formulation and implementation of an  ecosystem-based management  model of the Creek through the Integrated Stormwater Management Plan beginning in 2007.[3]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The Still Moon Arts Society is overseen by a nine-member Board of Directors headed by President Crecien Bencio and Vice-President Henry Lau.[4] Its work is supported by team of individuals including Artistic Director, Carmen Rose, General Manager, Bea Miller, a nine-person Youth Committee, and an eight-person Communications Committee.[5] Most of their activities are open to the public but certain events — such as monthly meetings of the Streamkeepers — require registration and recruitment efforts generally targeted at community members and residents of the Renfrew-Collingwood neighbourhood.  The Society is a registered non-profit, funded through donations, grants, and public/private partnerships.[6] As well, the Society also offers a number of services priced from $300-$400 including group tours of Renfrew Ravine, Lantern Workshops, Community-Engaged Art Talks, and stilt performers.[7]  Specializations, Methods and ToolsParticipatory ArtsStill Moon Arts Society specializes in the use of  participatory arts  to connect community members to each other and to the land. Through artistic experiences and expression, the Society imparts a passion for nature and communal living.[1] Their yearly Renfrew Ravine Moon Festival features a diverse array of participatory arts.[8]Ecosystem Based Management and StewardshipThe Society and its group of Still Creek Streamkeepers have been involved in the planning, restoration, and ongoing community governance of Still Creek in the Renfrew Ravine through an  ecosystem-based model of management . The Streamkeepers host public educational sessions on stream stewardship and their work includes the following activities:Water quality testing  Ravine cleaning  Garbage removal  Invertebrate sampling  Removing invasive species and replanting with native plants[2]Major Projects and EventsRestoration of Still Creek   As an official partner in the establishment of an ecosystem-based management model of stream governance over  Still Creek , the Still Moon Arts Society was tasked with “co-ordinat[ing] activities, provid[ing] leadership, and ensur[ing] liaison between all collaborators [as well as] connect[ing] people to resources in the community through EBM [ecosystem-based management] implementation.”[3] Since 2007, the Society and its group of Still Creek Streamkeepers continue to monitor the health of the creek and to organize events and activities to improve the water quality, sustain ecosystems, and rehabilitate the newly returned salmon.[2]Renfrew Ravine Moon FestivalA yearly event, the Renfrew Ravine Moon Festival is a celebration of creativity, community, and nature. Featuring local artists and various spectator and  hands-on activities , the Festival invites participants to celebrate the harvest season, learn more about community-members’ cultural traditions, and build an appreciation for the interconnected nature of local ecosystems and species.[8]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  In her Master’s Thesis for Simon Fraser University’s School of Resource and Environmental Management, Catherine Parsons found that local governments and community organizations such as the Still Moon Arts Society deserve equal recognition and credit in  the restoration of the Renfrew Ravine . In partnership with  the Evergreen Foundation , the Still Moon Arts Society was found to have been effective in raising awareness, mobilizing support, and organizing community-led efforts to restore the Still Creek Watershed.[11] Parsons concludes that the Society was instrumental in “establishing collaborations between people and organizations in the watershed… coordinat[ing] ecological restoration activities with the high school to educate students and foster[ing] environmental stewardship in youth.""[12]  Publications  Still Moon Arts Society is not directly involved in the production of research publications but they do circulate a semi-monthly, community-focused newsletter.[9] The resource section of their website also provides educational and background information on the Still Creek and Renfrew Ravine Restoration process such as the City of Vancouver’s Rain City Strategy and a local plant guide.[10]  See AlsoThe Collaborative Restoration of Vancouver's Still Creek  (case)Participatory Arts  (method)Ecosystem-based Management  (method)The Evergreen Foundation  (organization)  References  [1] Still Moon Arts, ""About,""  Still Moon Arts Society , October 13, 2012, http://stillmoon.org/about/.Update:  https://stillmoonarts.ca/our-story/[2] Still Moon Arts, “Still Creek Streamkeepers,”  Still Moon Arts Society , July 23, 2018,  https://stillmoonarts.ca/stewardship/streamkeepers/[3] Catherine Ernestina Maria Parsons, “Restoring a ‘Paradise of a Place’: Exploring the potential for urban Ecosystem-based Management in the Still Creek Watershed, Vancouver, BC,”  Simon Fraser University , June 26, 2015,  http://summit.sfu.ca/item/15649[4] Still Moon Arts, ""Board of Directors,""  Still Moon Arts Society ,  https://stillmoonarts.ca/our-story/our-team/[5] Still Moon Arts, ""Our Team,""  Still Moon Arts Society , Jan 15, 2016,  https://stillmoonarts.ca/our-story/our-team/[6] Still Moon Arts, ""Funders and Supporters,""  Still Moon Arts Society , October 9, 2012, http://stillmoon.org/about/funders-and-supporters/.

By improving the interconnections and interdependencies between people, nature, and the built world, Evergreen aims to help cities thrive in a sustainable manner. According to the group’s vision, “involving people directly in the process of restoring the health of local ecologies and their communities positively affects the attitudes and behaviours that lie at the core of the sustainable city” (About Evergreen).  Origins and Development  The Evergreen Foundation is a Canadian charity and international thought leader established in 1991. For over 25 years, Evergreen has been working in collaboration with diverse communities using a systems approach which recognizes people, places and environmental issues as “part of interdependent, complex social and economic systems” (About Evergreen). In total, over 200,000 volunteers have devoted more than 600,000 hours to Evergreen’s programs, greening public spaces and leading various projects in their communities. Their goal to turn innovative ideas into actionable projects is sought through a mix of engagement strategies, which aim to be playful and optimistic yet empowering and designed to initiate change. Throughout their history, Evergreen has and continues to be dedicated to the principle of accountability, ensuring that the delivery of programs is up to the standard of the communities and that those who put in time and effort are rewarded in kind.By the numbers:600,000 hours put in by over 200,000 volunteers  Over 1 million children in 25% of Canadian schools reached through the Toyota Evergreen Learning Grounds and 70,000 kids enrolled in Evergreen Brick Works outdoor learning  Over 500 community recipients of Evergreen grants and partnerships  1,511,692 trees, shrubs, and other greenery planted, and close to 4 million square metres naturalized across Canada  Almost $5 million invested in the local food economy and 686,542 pounds of food harvested from community gardens (Our Impact)Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingFunding for EvergreenEvergreen has numerous public and private sponsors and supporters, a full list of which is available  here .  National Partner: Toyota Canada Inc. and its Dealerships have worked with the foundation for over 12 years, distributed more than $2.8 million in grants to over 2,350 schools and day cares with an estimated impact on over 1 million students and close to 100,000 school faculty members.  Lead Partner: the  Government of Ontario  with its various ministries has partnered with Evergreen since the foundation’s inception. Together, this collaborative effort has made possible the realization of Evergreen’s goals: to “bring greenspace to cities across the province; find and share solutions to urban infrastructure and transportation challenges; and provide children, seniors, and families education about sustainable local food systems” (Sponsors and Supporters).  Other major contributors: Walmart Canada (Evergreen’s “Green Grants”), HSBC Bank Canada (Evergreen’s Greenspace program), and the J.W. McConnell Family Foundation (Evergreen’s Canadian Civic Commons Strategy – in progress).Funding Provided by EvergreenFrom 2000-2015, Evergreen and Walmart offered the “Green Grants” which supported over 600 school greening projects. The “Toyota Evergreen Learning Grounds” program gives resources to “help schools create outdoor classrooms to provide students with a healthy place to play, learn and develop a genuine respect for nature” (Grants). Since the grant was first offered in 2000, over 3000 schools across Canada have received funds to help engage their students in outdoors activities, build respect for nature, and learn about their surroundings while having fun.The RBC–Evergreen Watershed Champions Award has been given annually since 2014 and “recognizes classes that demonstrate learning about their local watershed and who take action to care for it” (RBC). Participants in the contest gain recognition for their work in sustainable management and development as well as community engagement activities that help to spread awareness about the necessity for ongoing watershed protection.Specializations, Methods and Tools  Evergreen has four areas of focus: Greenspace, Children, Food, and CityWorks.  1. Greenspace  Greenspace is Evergreen’s chiefly environmental program helping to connect the people with the ecosystems they live in. The program encompasses four areas: community greening, partner projects with municipalities and communities, restoring urban watersheds, and enhancing Toronto’s Lower Don Valley (see “Major Projects” section).i. Community GreeningCommunity greening events take place all over the Greater Toronto Area, Metro Vancouver, and Vancouver Island, providing individuals, families, and friends the opportunity to volunteer their time to increase the sustainability and restore the natural beauty of their neighbourhoods. Working in public parks and natural areas, community greening volunteers engage in various activities such as “planting trees, monitoring wildlife and removing invasive plant species.” The organization sees that its volunteers“Meet like-minded people in [their] community  Make a positive impact on the environment  Learn about the benefits of planting native trees and shrubs  Learn how to identify invasive species and how to remove them  Plant trees for future generations to enjoy  Have fun!” (Community Greening).Currently, there are multiple greening projects in the works.ii. Municipal and Community PartnershipsGreenspace’s work wouldn’t be possible without the strong ties Evergreen has developed with local municipalities, communities and community organizations, and other land managers. Through these partnerships, Greenspace has been given access to unique natural spaces and support in raising awareness and getting more individuals involved in the reinvigoration of their environments. Through these support networks, Evergreen’s initiatives are producing long-term, sustainable impacts.iii. Restoring Urban WatershedsWatersheds are defined as “area[s] of land where all of the water that is under it or on the surface of it goes to the same place” (Restoring Urban Watersheds). Urban watersheds in the Metro Vancouver Area and the Greater Toronto Area face degradation from civil infrastructure projects such as roads and buildings. As well,  stormwater  — the runoff from urban areas — flows downstream into these bodies of water, carrying with it various toxins and contaminants. Part of Evergreen’s Greenspace endeavour focuses on the restoration of these watersheds as well as increasing urban biodiversity and measuring the impact of urban development on urban streams.  To accomplish these goals, Evergreen and its community and municipal partners “remove invasive plants, reintroduce native plants, monitor water quality and learn about the importance of our local streams” (Ibid.). For example, the organization’s work on biodiversity is helped by the Invasive Species Council of Metro Vancouver and Ontario’s Invasive Species Awareness Program which, in use with Evergreen’s Native Plant Database, can help community members identify and remove or replace invasive and damaging plant species. As well, Evergreen’s “Uncover Your Creeks” program on the coast of BC has sixteen different monitoring sites which are used by volunteers and community members to track the quality of water. The data from this project helps Evergreen understand the impacts of urban development on these streams, to develop interventions and, ultimately, to mitigate the harmful aspects of this process (See “Major Projects” section of this article for further information).  Finally, the urban watersheds program is focused on climate change mitigation and adaptation, defined as “actions taken to respond to the impacts of climate change by taking advantage of opportunities or reducing the associated risks” (Restoring Urban Watersheds). The Metro Vancouver Area and the Greater Toronto Area are both expected to feel the effects of climate change in terms of increasingly severe and frequent rainfall — both of which “can mean damage to infrastructure and public property, and health impacts due to wastewater contamination in water bodies” (Ibid.). Since there are a variety of ways communities and individuals can get involved in climate change adaptation, Evergreen, with support from the Intact Foundation, “is connecting residents with opportunities for climate adaption in their watersheds through the Community Climate Adaptation Initiative” more information about which can be found by click here. As well, on a municipal level, Evergreen recently supported the Vancouver Parks Board’s Master Plan for the  restoration of Still Creek  (see “Major Projects and Events” section of this article for a more in-depth account).  2. Children  As the world moves more online, children are spending more time indoors, less time exercising, and developing a sense of community with their peers. Evergreen is determined to change this worrying trend by offering young Canadians a variety of ways to engage with the natural world, “to learn and to engage their senses, to explore and to discover their surroundings, and to challenge their minds and bodies” (Children). Four areas make up this ambitious initiative: the greening of school grounds, programs for learning and playing outdoors, leadership opportunities, and year-round day camps.i. Greening School GroundsEvergreen’s work on school grounds involves balancing the natural with the built world, creating an environment that meets the functional needs of the classroom while offering kids “different looks, sensory experiences and play opportunities in every season” (Greening School Grounds). Evergreen brings the influence of naturally occurring features into the planning and design process which creates diverse landscapes for children to explore and discover.  Evergreen takes a one-on-one approach to their school greening initiatives, working closely with each school board to draw up the optimal design for their location, resource allotment, goals and needs. Currently, the organization works with 13 school boards and districts as well as the Nova Scotia Department of Education and Early Development but encourages any interested citizen or school to become involved through the national network of Evergreen planning experts who provide assistance with:“Approvals processes – creating clear lines of communication and accountability within the school board  Guidance through a participatory design process – resulting in coordination between the school board, school administrators, facilities staff, external suppliers, parents and the broader community  Planning support for project installations – preventing costly mistakes in school-ground modifications and creating high-quality, safe and lasting project designs  Design guidelines – providing clarity for all project stakeholders and creating significant efficiencies  Education and training – supporting schools in the use of and care for their new spaces, and providing the motivation for engaging students in both.” (School Board Collaborations &amp; Services)In addition to offering expert collaboration, Evergreen offers a number of grant opportunities to schools (see “Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding"").ii. Outdoor Learning and PlayingLearning through hands-on experience is vital to childhood education and, thankfully, the natural world provides plenty of opportunity to do so. Evergreen is dedicated to ensuring kids have the ability to explore and discover their environment by offering school and home-based activity ideas to educators, parents and guardians through  workshops , school programming, and publications.  The Watershed Champions program is an example of the kinds of outdoor learning initiatives Evergreen encourages schools to offer their students. Schools compete for the “RBC–Evergreen Watershed Champions Award” by learning about, caring for, and spreading awareness around their local watersheds. More information on the award is found in the “Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding” section.  Another example of Evergreen’s work in this area is the “All Hands in the Dirt Forum”: an annual meeting of education, administration and design experts to discuss best practices and new innovations in the area of outdoor learning. Past forums have included workshops, activities, and small-group discussions on topics such as:“Addressing questions of risky play in the outdoors  Increasing and improving learning opportunities in children’s outdoor spaces  Unpacking policies and practices for children’s outdoor spaces  Designing for child development and increased physical activity  Evaluation and assessment for teaching outdoors” (All Hands in the Dirt Forum).iii. Youth LeadershipThe Evergreen Foundation believes that “a key component is having the opportunity to develop skills and gain experience in nature while becoming the stewards of the environment we’ll need for tomorrow” (Youth Leadership). Together with community organizations, Evergreen offers a number of youth leadership programs which emphasize hands-on learning and teamwork. The Community Bicycle Hub Project is a great example of the social-enterprising abilities youth can gain through these activities. After learning to fix donated bikes, participants return to their communities and pass on their acquired skills. Similarly, youth involved in the Healthy Choices program work together to “make healthy food choices for themselves, their communities and the planet” (Ibid.). Community and teamwork are also key aspects of the Aboriginal Visiting High Schools project, a collaborative effort between Evergreen and schools groups to facilitate the transfer of traditional knowledge between elders, members of the Aboriginal community, and youth.  Alongside these programs is the yearly HSBC-Evergreen Youth Action Series, a week-long series of events “exploring ecology, green living, stewardship and green infrastructure all while offering youth the opportunity to network with others who are stewards of the environment” (HSBC–Evergreen Youth Action Series). In 2016, the event was to be held in five different cities in Canada: Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.Finally, Evergreen holds leadership training programs for its summer camps (discussed below). Leaders-in Training and Assistant Counsellors are each offered two week training programs that serve as valuable volunteer hours for school.iv. Day CampsEvergreen is proud to offer different day camp experiences at their Brick Works facility in Toronto: Nature Nut Kids' Club, Sprouts Parent and Tot Play, PA Day Camps, Homeschool Program, March Break Day Camp, Green City Adventure Camp, and Winter Camps. Each day camp is focused on giving children the ability to experience and explore the natural, ‘greener’ side of Toronto through outdoor play. Designed to educate the next generation of inspired environmental stewards, each program is planned according to the following principles:“Place Based – building a foundation of knowledge through a focus on local nature, culture and community.  Ecological – providing children direct contact with nature.  Hands-on – creating a setting for compelling learning through multi-sensory, direct experiences.  Active and mobile – moving the body to engage the mind.  Arts-infused – breathing life into learning through creativity, compelling narratives and arts activities.  Integrated – weaving together knowledge and skill through ecological themes and engaging experiences.” (Evergreen Brick Works Day Camps).More information on the each of the different day camps can be found  here .3. Food  Evergreen’s approach to food is simple: good food = happy people and healthy cities. By supporting local farms, encouraging the growth of food in cities, and working to improve the eating and living habits of everyday citizens, Evergreen aims to make a change in the way we sustain ourselves.i. Supporting Local FarmsGlobalization has caused a fundamental disconnect between consumers and the producers of their food. Evergreen believes that re-establishing this connection is key to creating a sustainable food system, “preserv[ing] the health of our cities, the integrity of our environment and the strength of our communities” (Supporting Local Farms). To initiate this, Evergreen has committed itself to the following guiding principles:“Accessibility: A farmers' market and food programs that are accessible to diverse audiences.  Collaborative Infrastructure: Build relationships with other like-minded organizations and community groups, as well as the community at large.  Innovation: Foster and celebrate innovation at our farmers' market and in the design and delivery of our food programs.  Education: Create an experiential, hands-on approach to the delivery of our food programs.  Replicability: Establish models that can be replicated locally and nationally.” (Ibid.)In order to accomplish these goals, Evergreen encourages its partners, volunteers, community members, and interested citizens to:Shop at the Farmer’s Market located in Evergreen’s own Brick Works facility in Toronto  Engage in Evergreen’s Community Supported Agriculture program (more information here)  Visit the Farmer’s Markets Canada website to find local producers outside the Toronto areaii. Growing Food in the CityCreating a sustainable food network starts at the community level, whether it is sourcing food directly from local producers or growing one's own. The Evergreen foundation offers two programs designed to make the food growing process easy even for the apartment-bound city dweller.  For those living in Toronto, the Urban Agriculture program at the Evergreen Brick Works showcases new innovations in do-it-yourself food production. The easily replicable food gardens offer everything from organic vegetables to edible flowers while the greenhouse “features raised-bed food gardening, various organic agricultural techniques and window farms to showcase a “full circle” approach to seasonal food-growing in urban areas” (Growing Food). Similarly, grow tubes demonstrate how nutritious food can be grown in cold climates using very little light. Evergreen’s dedicated compost-experts volunteer their time as ‘worm wranglers’, imparting the wisdom of “at-home composting, the benefits of waste management and the importance of healthy soil to all visitors at Evergreen Brick Works” (Ibid.). Finally, both the Seniors Garden and the Cooking Classrooms offer visitors the opportunity to engage hands-on in the food growing (and eating!) process.iii. Healthy Eating and Active LivingCities and communities are only as healthy as their citizens so Evergreen has made it its mission to encourage individuals across the country to develop healthy eating and active lifestyles. Workshops and educational events make it easy for anyone— big eaters or small—to learn how to create hassle-free, healthy meals using local ingredients. Seniors Community Kitchen at the Brick Works brings seniors and youth together with Evergreen staff to “share skills and knowledge, socialize and prepare seasonal, nutritious meals together” (Healthy Eating &amp; Active Living). As well, Evergreen experts work with Community Kitchens in the Greater Toronto Area to discuss everything from fundraising strategies and buying on a budget to food justice and increasing the kitchen’s food gardening capabilities. Check the calendar for events happening across the country  here .The Healthy Choices initiative is Evergreen’s way of engaging directly with communities “to share meals, celebrate food and build life-long skills, and invite a wide range of groups to connect with our passionate and expert staff” (Healthy Eating &amp; Active Living). As well, the Healthy Choices initiative also offers youth-specific programs (see “Children” section of this article).  4. City Works  City design and civil infrastructure planning have profound effects on the way inhabitants live and interact as well as the natural environment they displace or overlap. Evergreen’s City Works initiative engages the public, innovators, designers and decision makers to reduce the large-scale environmental impact of our cities – from city-building to housing to transportation, Evergreen “believe[s] that transformative change can happen when Canadians are engaged with new ideas, in ways that are relevant to them” (City Works).i. City BuildingSustainable development is complicated by accelerated urbanization and aging infrastructure. Evergreen’s City Building initiative brings leading research and design to its collaborative work with city planners and communities to help develop a clear vision for the future. It is Evergreen’s hope that this vision combined with local, national, and global action will mitigate the risks our human and environmental health face by building cities with smaller carbon footprints and more sustainable infrastructure.  Evergreen’s City Building department has just finished two projects—100in1day Canada and Project Green Bloc in Vancouver—and is involved in two other ongoing initiatives: the Hamilton City Building Action Campaign and “We Are Cities”. Information on all these projects is available in the “Major Projects and Events” section.ii. HousingGlobal rises in urbanization demand a rethinking of housing infrastructure. By 2036, the population of the Greater Toronto Area is expected to increase by more than 9 million and it is therefore imperative that an integrated approach to housing is generated, “one that is more sustainable, affordable and equitable” (Housing). Evergreen believes that through the building of “collaborative capacity and co-created solutions”, a green future for Toronto’s housing systems may be developed.  By testing these ideas on a local scale, Evergreen hopes to deploy proven sustainable housing strategies across Canada where appropriate. The GTA Housing Action Lab is the real-life testing ground for these new innovations. The Toronto area is facing many of the same urban housing problems faced by other cities across the nation and, indeed, across the globe. Specifically, some of these challenges include lack of affordability especially for lower income households; environmental degradation from automotive travel; lack of social housing and affordable repair options; and a growing disparity between “development patterns and regional growth and transportation planning. The GTA Housing Action Lab aims to collaboratively develop:“Programs and policies that support the affordability of housing to ensure residents of all incomes have the best chance to live in a suitable home and have a choice in their housing  A more sustainable housing system in the region by increasing public support for intensification, awareness of the benefits of complete communities, and policies that support creative infill in our urban centres and a connected region  A policy and regulatory framework that encourages diversity in form and tenure, intensification and affordability, and creates incentives aligned with the needs of the residents of the region while creating an economically viable housing sector” (GTA Housing Action Lab)Another project Evergreen’s City Works is involved in is “Tower Renewal”, more information about which can be found in the “Major Projects and Events” section.iii. TransportationTransporting people and goods across the country accounts for 27% of Canada’s emissions. The ability to move sustainably is under pressure from increasingly dense, sprawling urban populations. Evergreen’s work on transportation recognizes the need for creativity and vision to come up with new forms of travel and, therefore, its projects such as “Move the GTHA” and the “TrafficJam Hackathon” focus on engaging Canadians in discussion and debate on this important topic. More information on these projects is available in the following section, “Major Projects and Events”.  Major Projects and EventsUncover Your CreeksOne of the Evergreen Foundation’s major projects is the “Uncover Your Creeks” initiative which helps monitor urban streams in Metro Vancouver and the Greater Toronto Area. Recently, the Evergreen Foundation was involved in the restoration Master Plan of Vancouver’s Still Creek. Evergreen took a leading role, engaging with local governments and members of the public and undertaking rehabilitation activities such as riparian planting (Tyler Carlson). As well, the ongoing data collection and monitoring of the stream was made possible through a partnership with the Community-University Research Alliance (CURA) H2O project. CURA H20 works with various government and community partners in Canada and abroad to “build capacity within stewardship organizations through a variety of resources and training, and to address the lack of consistency by standardizing data collection at the community level via the Wet-Pro training program” (About CURA H20). In this case, CURA H2O and Evergreen are helping the community monitor the health of its stream and take measures when needed without the need for government intervention. A full case study of the Still Creek project is available  here .Lower Don ProjectThe Don River Valley is located in the heart of Toronto’s East York district and is currently home to 250k residents with an expected increase of 80k in the coming years. The Lower Don Greenway is accessible through 5km of trails yet few residents are aware of the diverse natural ecosystem located right in their backyard. Public green spaces “create livable communities and promote personal, social, cultural and environmental health” and it is therefore Evergreen’s mission to revitalize the Lower Don trail. Working in collaboration with partners such as the  City of Toronto  and the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, Evergreen has planned a variety of improvements to “allow residents and visitors to better enjoy and appreciate the wonders of this remarkable ravine corridor” (Lower Don Project):New gateways and access points  Pedestrian and cycling trail enhancements  Restored green spaces  New public art and educational programsFor more information on the project, please see “External Links”.100in1day Canada100in1day is a global movement started in 2012 by a group of design students in Colombia. What began as an albeit ambitious plan to launch 100 urban interventions in one day produced a world-wide phenomenon. The original event in May of 2012 returned an unanticipated 250 interventions and since then 100in1day has been held in 31 cities around the world. Evergreen is proud to have led 100in1day Canada which occurred on June 4, 2016 in six cities: Toronto, Vancouver, Edmonton, Hamilton, Montreal, and Halifax, and initiated 580 citizen-developed building ideas. More information on each of the projects can be found in the ""External Links"".Project Green Bloc in VancouverProject Green Bloc was started as a three-year project with the ambitious aim to “fill the gap between individual level and city-level change and forge a strong bloc of neighbours, willing to take action individually and collectively to mitigate climate change and unsustainable levels of consumption out of a random group of residents who just happened to live on the same city block” (Project Green Bloc). To accomplish this, Evergreen worked with the residents of Vancouver’s Riley Park neighbourhood to lessen the community’s ecological footprint by 25% through local action and behavioural change. Four main components made up the project:Research to measure household and neighbourhood ecological footprints  Carefully structured community consultation and dialogue  Cooperative local greening and sustainability initiatives  Activities to build community cohesion and social inclusionBy the end of the three years, the neighbourhood had collectively reduced their ecological footprint by 12% but legacy projects such street greening and traffic calming ensure a long-term dedication to their sustainable living goals.The Hamilton City Building Action CampaignHamilton is experiencing a period of urban revitalization and cultural renaissance and, in order to both accelerate and sustain this, Evergreen CityWorks is collaborating with their partners, Planning Alliance, the Hamilton Communication Foundation, and the City of Hamilton to initiate the multi-year Hamilton City Building Action Campaign. The campaign consists of five elements focused on “work[ing] with the community in shaping the city’s future, connect[ing] plans and policies while also catalyzing on-the-ground results” (Hamilton City Building Action Campaign).  1. Outreach, Engagement, and Collaboration – bringing a diverse selection of residents and stakeholders into the discussion  2. Priority Scanning and Mapping the City – meetings with various players in the community revealed an overwhelming  consensus  that focus should be placed on “tangible actions and specific urban interventions” (Hamilton City Building Action Campaign).  3. West Harbour Engagement Strategy – discussing the future of the West Harbour neighbourhood with its residents, local community groups and organizations, stakeholders, and Lura Consulting. These discussions will in turn be used to inform future communication strategies between city officials and community residents.  4. Next Generation City Builders – Imagine My Sustainable Hamilton (IMSH) – a four-day program intended to bring ecological awareness and sustainable city-building to seventh grade classrooms in over 15 schools. As well, students are constructing 3D models of their visions for their future neighbourhoods with the help of the art collective No. 9 in collaboration with the Hamilton Wentworth District School Board (HWDSB) and local architects and artists.  5. Community Capacity Building and Action100in1Day Hamilton (see previous section of this article)  Training and Capacity Building Workshops  Community Driven Catalyst Projects294 James Street North A Collaboration Station and Community Hub for Engagement“We Are Cities”We Are Cities is an ongoing initiative launched in February 2015 to address the need for liveable cities across Canada. The project is  crowdsourcing  ideas from Canadians for an action plan as well as helping to support current initiatives. To date, “there have been over 50  roundtables  in 25 cities across 10 provinces, over 175 ideas have been submitted online” and the foundation has created the new “We Are Cities: Community Innovation Grant” to help progress local projects (We Are Cities).Tower RenewalThe Tower Renewal project began in 2007 in response to the deterioration of Ontario’s Greater Golden Horseshoe concrete apartment blocks. Situated in marginalized neighbourhoods with few amenities and limited access to transport, the 2,000 aging, energy inefficient towers represent 20% of Toronto’s housing stock and are home to nearly 1 million people. Recognizing the need for intervention, Graeme Stewart and Michael McClelland of ERA Architects initiated the renewal project which, thanks to the Centre for Urban Growth and Renewal and the City of Toronto, encompasses three processes:“An energy retrofit of existing buildings  Improved livability for renters and their surrounding communities through increased social and economic opportunities within tower neighbourhoods  Better use of the green space around these towers through mixed-use infill development and improved transit connections to and from these neighbourhoods” (Tower Renewal).Through these efforts, it is hoped that the towers are transformed from “isolated and often socially marginalized dormitories into dynamic, integrated and low-carbon hubs across the city” (Tower Renewal).Move the GTHABack in 2011, a number of community organizations were brought together by Evergreen CityWorks and the Toronto Atmospheric fund to discuss the possibility of forming a collaboration. By working together, it was hoped that these organizations would be able to raise public awareness and increase support for transit infrastructure. Subsequently, “Move the GTHA” was born in September 2012 and now has 12 core members and 16 supporting organi",1,0,1,1,0,

The platform facilitates a variety of online functions including a newsfeed, images and videos and newsletterws. The aims are twofold: firstly, to enable a client to share the relevant story with their target audience and ensure reach, and secondly to enable engagement with the story through discussion forums, quick polls and surveys, Q&amp;As and brainstorming.  There are also tools integrated into the platform that enable recording and analysis of the data collected, and the ability to generate reports from this. The platform is moderated by EngagementHQ, who also provide training and tech support.Budget AllocatorBudget Allocator is a software for  participatory budgeting . The software can be personalized and used for different types of budget decisions from allocating small community grants to deciding local government budgets.Major Projects and EventsBang the Table software has been used extensively in Canada, United States, Australia, New Zealand, and The United Kingdom. Often EngagementHQ is used as part of a broader engagement strategy utilizing both online and face-to-face approaches.

You can help Participedia by adding to it.Mission and PurposeThe intention of the Center for Wise Democracy is to engage citizens in a new level of problem-solving, where they become more informed and more proactive, overcome much partisan divide and distrust of government, and help generate breakthrough progress on key issues. The sustainable, safe strategy for achieving these results is to implement regular  Wisdom Councils  among the citizenry as well as to establish  Dynamic Facilitation  and Wisdom Councils as a regular process within government and civic organizations. This is a new breakthrough approach currently being already applied in a few places in Europe, which was developed by Jim Rough, a founding member of the Center for Wise Democracy. It is safe, inexpensive, and proven to work.Origins and DevelopmentIn 2002, Jim and Jean Rough, together with DeAnna Martin, founded the Center for Wise Democracy. Their intention was to encourage experiments with the Wisdom Council. In November 2003 after a radio interview three listeners from the Rogue Valley of Oregon called to express interest in trying a Wisdom Council in their area.  With the help of democracy pioneers like  Tom Atlee  (Author of  The Tao of Democracy ), Adin Rogovin (Board member of the  Co-Intelligence Institute ),  Joseph McCormick (founder of Reuniting America), and Elliot Shuford (Board member of  Healthy Democracy Oregon ), a Wisdom Council experiment was set up. The experiment worked far more powerfully than anybody could explain. From its origin in the United States of America the Wisdom Council Process started to spread over the Atlantic.Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingThe Center for Wise Democracy relies on donations and revenues from supporting Wisdom Councils.Specializations, Methods and ToolsDynamic FacilitationJim Rough invented  Dynamic Facilitation  in the early 1980s. Dynamic Facilitation is designed to help a group achieve unity. Dynamic Facilitation is particularly suitable for solving conflicted or impossible seeming issues. It inevitably reveals the real problem and comes up with unanimous solutions.Wisdom Council ProcessThe  Wisdom Council  process is an ongoing application of Dynamic facilitation. It can function at various levels (neighborhood, city, county, state, national, international...). It helps diverse people appreciate one another, feel empowered and reach unified conclusions.  The Wisdom Council process includes a wide diversity of citizens including the mainstream, and not just the “usual suspects.” It is based on  Dynamic Facilitation  (DF), a way to reliably generate unity around win/win solutions to seemingly impossible problems. DF can be used by organizations for strategic planning, conflict resolution and team building. And it is the core of the Wisdom Council process, the “magic sauce,” which provides for magical seeming results. Our vision is to set in motion a development process that will yield a cadre of trained Dynamic Facilitators to support a prosperous future full of with wise democracyChoice CreatingChoice creating often arises naturally in a crisis. Then, people immediately recognize the seriousness of the situation and pull together, each contributing to a solution that works for all.Major Projects and EventsAnalysis and Lessons LearnedPublicationsSee AlsoReferencesExternal LinksNotes",1,0,1,1,0,

To promote the development of open cultural projects: well-documented, adaptable and replicable.  To foster an atmosphere of cooperation and exchange that encompasses life and human affection with value placed on informality and community.  To experiment, improve and evaluate collaborative work methodologies and modus operandi at the various levels of action: institutional in general, within the organisation itself and in users’ development of projects.  To open up spaces for critical reflection on digital technology and its impact on society.""

Please help us verify its content.Mission and PurposeThe PAH defines itself as &quot;a nonpartisan group of [...] people who, upon finding that the current legal framework is designed to guarantee that banks collect debts, while leaving mortgaged people unprotected for reasons such as the unemployment or the rise in fees can not cope with the bills. &quot;[1]The PAH denounces the fraud of the mortgage process of the real estate bubble, with surcharges and abusive clauses on the part of the banks, in such a way that we affirm that the debt contracted by citizens is an illegitimate debt. The PAH also denounces that, in the face of the crisis, while the banks are rescued with public money, the population is seen to be unprotected and their right to housing, enshrined in the constitution, disappears. The PAH demands that the public administrations fulfill their duty to investigate the fraud of the mortgage process and to guarantee the population the right to decent housing.  The PAH is considered a horizontal, nonviolent, assembly-based and nonpartisan movement. It meets in an assembly way to present the different cases of those affected, offer advice and mutual help to find both practical and emotional support. On May 18, 2011, the PAH, with its registered office at Calle de Córcega No. 521, was registered in the National Registry of Associations of the Ministry of the Interior.Origins and DevelopmentThe PAH arises in February 2009 in Barcelona and is present throughout the Spanish geography. The Platform emerged within the framework of the 2008-2013 Spanish real estate crisis that was triggered by the real estate bubble and the subsequent protests in Spain in 2011-2013.  Since 1999, the price of housing in Spain has risen by around 180% in a decade (1996-2006), well above salaries, which led to a situation in which citizens spend a large part of their salary on buying a flat.  The rise in prices was caused by the real estate bubble, which is caused by factors such as the shortage of rental housing (85% of all dwellings destined for ownership, while this rate is 61% in the rest of Europe , and the existence of a park of three million empty houses, which corresponds to 20% of the total.  Despite this, Spain is one of the countries in Europe with the lowest rental rate, something that is attributed to a fiscal policy that favors the purchase.  Since the economic crisis of 2008-2013, the increase in unemployment has skyrocketed to figures above 20%, which has made it impossible for thousands of families to pay their home mortgage. Since 2007, 350,000 families have been left homeless, foreclosed on for non-payment of the mortgage has caused that more than 350,000 families have been evicted in Spain after the crisis. After the house auction, the houses are once again appraised below their initial appraisal price, with the owners having to pay the difference without having the enjoyment of the property.Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingPAH is financed by the common people and sustained more by the will and effort of the people than by large donations. That is why it seeks to create ties between the people who want to help and the organization. In fact, the most important thing about the PAH are its local nodes, so it is thought that before donating to the global account, do it to the nearest PAH, so that it can be known and eventually join its activities. .Specializations, Methods and ToolsThe PAH groups together people with difficulties to pay the mortgage or who are in the process of foreclosure and people in solidarity with this problem. The PAH develops different strategies to guarantee the right to housing of thousands of people.  One of the initiatives of the platform is to carry out actions of civil disobedience and passive resistance to executions and notifications of evictions by holding rallies at the door of the houses of those affected, preventing the passage of judicial agents. This campaign began in November 2010 and in July 2014 it had already stopped 1,135 evictions throughout the state, according to the organization itself.Major Projects and EventsSettlementCampaign for the dation in payment: delivery of the home for the cancellation of the mortgage debt in case of habitual residence and debtors in good faith. In June 2010, the PAH and the DESC Observatory sent Congress a proposal to amend the law that was rejected by the PP and PSOE. The organized voice of those affected has managed to bring together social groups and trade union organizations and has launched an ILP to collect signatures and bring the PAH proposal to the Congress of Deputies again.The non-legal recognition of the dation in payment would have to be added the picaresque of the auctions at 50% of the appraised value in favor of the banks. In May 2013, the banks continued to award homes at 50% auctions using their real estate subsidiaries. The price for which the house is valued when the bank is auctioned is decisive to establish the outstanding debt with the bank when the dation in payment is not applied. Despite the modifications of the government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero that increased the percentage from 50% to 60% and the rise from 60% to 70% by the government of Mariano Rajoy, the bank, using its own real estate subsidiaries, is awarded the homes 50% of their appraised value thanks to the figure of a third party in the auction, which is your real estate subsidiary. Article 670.4 of the civil procedure law allows this trick that leaves legal modifications on paper.Obra Social La PAHFaced with the growing wave of evictions, the platform proposes a campaign that seeks the citizen appropriation of empty homes in the hands of financial entities resulting from foreclosures. In the cases in which the citizen concentrations of stop evictions do not paralyze the evictions, the PAH will cover the families to occupy the houses from which they have been evicted. This campaign has a triple objective:Recover the social function of an empty house to guarantee that the family is not left on the street.Increase pressure on financial institutions to accept dation in payment.Force public administrations to adopt once and for all the necessary measures to guarantee the right to housing.The title of this campaign is a parody of Obra Social La Caixa, one of the main causes of the situation.25-S mobilizationsOn September 25, 2011, the PAH and other civil society organizations called for a state mobilization in 41 cities in Spain. Thousands of people demanded a regulatory change to, among other things, stop the trickle of evictions caused by the economic crisis and allow retroactive payment, and in defense of the constitutional right to decent housing.Popular Legislative Initiative for Dignified Housing On March 30, 2011, the PAH and the DESC Observatory, together with other social entities and trade union organizations (UGT, CCOO, Taula del third Sector, UCC, CONFAVC) began to process the text of the Initiative. Legislative Popular (ILP) in order to regulate dation in payment, so that the thousands of families condemned to default for life due to the current law and the loans they requested have the right to a second chance as well as in other European countries and the United States. Subsequently, the text was expanded with requests for an immediate moratorium on evictions and a public park for social rent, as a minimum measure aimed at guaranteeing the right to housing of people affected by foreclosures.Between March and September 2011, the Bureau of Congress (made up of PSOE, PSC, PP, CiU, and PNV) blocked the ILP for different reasons, preventing the collection of signatures from beginning before the 2011 general elections, being this authorized In September, however, the Central Electoral Board did not begin collecting ILP signatures until April 18, 2012.1,402,845 signatures were delivered on February 5, 2013 in Congress. They called a demonstration for February 16, 2013, and held a virtual escrache to get it admitted for processing. On February 12, the ILP was approved for processing with 333 votes in favor and one abstention. They affirm that the change of position of the Popular Party was due to popular pressure. They maintained their warning to carry out physical escrache if they do not approve the ILP as delivered.  For a few weeks, acts of protest were common in the form of escrache to the Popular Party politicians. However, various media as well as the government launched a smear campaign against the escraches that reduced popular support for these protests (which initially stood at over 70%), although they did not manage to affect the popularity of the PAH, supported by the media. alternatives and social networks.On April 2, 2013, the spokesperson for the popular parliamentary group announced that the Popular Legislative Initiative (ILP) on evictions was going to be merged with the law that the government had presented and that does not contemplate dation in payment, precisely the main proposal of the ILP. In this way, the ILP accepted for processing on February 16 by the Congress of Deputies was de facto rejected. In addition, the spokesman denounced the escraches to which several deputies and leaders of his party were being subjected by members of the anti-eviction organizations.Judgment of the Court of Justice of the European UnionOn March 14, 2013, the Court of Justice of the European Union (TEU) ruled that Law 1/2000, of January 7, on Civil Procedure that regulates the foreclosure procedure, does not guarantee citizens sufficient protection against to abusive clauses in mortgages and therefore violates Community regulations, specifically Council Directive 93/13 / EEC of April 5, 1993 on consumer protection. The judgment of the European Court of Luxembourg is issued in response to a question presented by the commercial court of Barcelona, specifically by judge José María Fernández Seijo, at the request of lawyer Dionisio Moreno, defender in the Mohamed Aziz case, given the impossibility of paralyze an eviction presented by Spanish law. According to the sentence, the foreclosure procedures may be paralyzed by the judge, in compliance with the indicated community regulations. European justice rules that Law 1/2000, of January 7, on Civil Procedure is not compatible with Directive 93/13 / EEC, insofar as there are not sufficient grounds for opposition to foreclosure that make possible the exercise of legal actions or remedies that guarantee an effective protection of consumer rights. The sentence, however, does not expressly pronounce on the demands of the Platform for People Affected by the Mortgage included in the Popular Legislative Initiative for Dignified Housing, especially on the issue of dation in payment or the suspension of evictions. For Judge José María Fernández Seijo, the sentence modifies the rules of the game of the Spanish law on foreclosure, since it allows judges to freeze evictions ex officio.Awards2012 - Català de l&#39;Any 2012 Award for the best solidarity initiative.

Like their counterparts in the USA, Canada and other places in the world, OccupyGhana also seeks to give a voice to the majority of people in Ghana.  Origins and Development  This group was started by a group of middle class professionals, notably lawyers, teachers, doctors, students, researchers, bankers, journalists, etc who hitherto had remained silent on the many happenings in government before and after the Fourth Republican Constitution came into being in January 1993.  The organization began as a loose online community using the hashtag  #occupyflagstaffhouse  and moderated by a few volunteers calling themselves “The Concerned Ghanaians for Responsible Governance,” (CCGRG). It soon became apparent that the Twitter hashtag discussions revolved around the same goals: ending government corruption, addressing infrastructure decay and intervening in Ghana’s worsening economy. Consequently, the transition from online discussion to on-the-ground action came on July 1st, Republic Day. Approximately five hundred people turned up to occupy Flag Staff House, the office and residence of President John Dramani Mahama. The initial group of organizers – still using the name Concerned Ghanaians for Responsible Governance – delivered a  petition  to the government asking for immediate action on numerous social ills.[1]  The #occupyflagstaffhouse protest served as a catalyst for the creation of the OccupyGhana organization. Originally its members sought to distance themselves from the rest of Ghanaian society, perhaps in the belief that only middle class, educated professionals would evoke a reaction from the government. This approach not only failed but it also undermined the legitimacy of the protest – whose asks were not unreasonable – since the Constitution guarantees equal representation and denies the privileging of certain voices. A new  protest  – #RedFriday – was launched just ten days after the first and called for all Ghanaians, regardless of social standing or profession, to again turn to  social media  to spread their message and to wear the colour red in solidarity with the campaign.[2] According to Al Jazeera, this second attempt was the true turning point in the creation of OccupyGhana as a standing organization. Included in #RedFriday were “countless individuals and diverse groups - ranging from faith-based organisations, academia, farmer-based associations, non-governmental organisations, women groups, students and political parties.”[3] Accordingly, the OccupyGhana membership now covers a wide range of people from all spectrums of society.[4]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  As presented on their website, OccupyGhana is run by an executive team consisting of nine professional individuals consisting of a lawyer, a chartered accountant, a researcher, a journalist, a civil/structural engineer, a digital marketing strategist, a marketer, a IT consultant and an investment banker. While information is not provided in regards to these individuals relations to the government, given that it is an anti-corruption organization, presumably it is unaffiliated with the Ghanaian government. This executive team carries out the background coordination for protests and  online deliberation  activities.  The organization is open to anyone; signing up to be a member does not cost any money. Through their website Occupygh.org, signing up requires only a name and an email address. Likewise, the organization uses both Facebook and Twitter to alert citizens to local political and social issues. ‘Liking’ or ‘following’ the organization on these platforms allow people to both demonstrate their solidarity with the movement and to sign up for alerts to new postings.  While specific funders are not provided on the organization website, perhaps for political reasons, there is a ""donation"" tab on the web which may have helped start-up costs as well as continual operational costs of the organization.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  OccupyGhana is a citizen-watchdog group dedicated to informing the public about government activities. The organization is also known to transform its online support into on-the-ground action in the form of non-violent  protest ,  demonstration ,  picketing  and  occupation .Online , members and non-members interact using Facebook and Twitter platforms. Facebook serves as a hub where members share information (videos, pictures and articles) and perspectives to increase awareness and strengthen solidarity. Much of the organization's action is done through the umbrella name of the organization, the personal names of individuals participating in action is not provided. Initiatives on behalf of the organization are backed by extensive research to validate claims. While the organization does have a formal sign-up forum on its website, supporters of the organization also mobilize action through  social media  with campaigns to articulate the group's message. The subsequent offline action generally takes the form of organized protests in the form of picketing, demonstrations and occupation. As well, as seen in the #RedFriday Campaign, simple acts of solidarity are encouraged such as wearing the colour red or locally-made dresses.[5]  Major Projects and Events  After the original #occupyflagstaffhouse and #RedFriday protests, OccupyGhana coalesced into an official organization that has dedicated itself to its aims of spreading awareness and, bringing an end to the government’s inefficiency and general ineptitude.  A timeline of its major initiatives is as follows (government/public reactions in parentheses):  October 2014Public demonstration against the continuation of poor economic governance 100 days after #occupyflagstaffhouse (no reaction)  Protest against Ghana’s hosting of the African Cup of Nation football tournament due to the risk of Ebola (successful)[6]November 2014: Bringing awareness to Auditor-General flaws[7]After a public inquiry into the Auditor-General, OccupyGhana found evidence for his mismanagement of public funds (no reaction – campaign continues)  Demand for member of parliament Nelson Abudu-Baani to step down after calling for “adulterous women” to be stoned (eventually apologized for his comments)  Took an official position against government official’s cash hand outs to journalists in exchange for favourable media coverage (some journalists stopped covering OccupyGhana’s activities in protest)February 2015Organization wrote to the National Communications Authority asking for information on the new ‘interconnect clearing house’ through which all internet connection will be re-routed[8] (NCA failed to respond)[9]  Issuing of a Statement in Support Of “Wɔn’ Gbo”, meaning “We Are Dying”, a protest led by the oppositional New Patriotic Party demanding an end to “dumsor”, a colloquial term for the continuous electrical power outages[10] (President issued a press statement promising to ‘do more’)[11]October 2015[12]Support for DUMSORMUSTSTOP vigil led by Ghanaian actress Yvonne Nelson (blackouts continue)[13]  Official rejection of government proposed 9% increase in Fuel Prices (no response)  Condemnation of the assassination of Mahama Adams, opposition Upper-West ChairmenMay 2016Revelation of backroom deal between the government and Smarttys where the latter was contracted – using public funds – to cover its public buses with images of the president (no response)[14]  OccupyGhana filed a Supreme Court action against the Attorney-General to enforce the Auditor-General’s governmental obligation[15]Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

 To assist public and private organizations and agencies in promoting social and economic justice, and the welfare of the State of Minnesota and its people; and to encourage, promote and implement social justice projects which will benefit the members of this organization, and the people of the State of Minnesota. 
 Origins and Development 
 Founded by Steve Fletcher, the bylaws of the not-for-profit were adopted in 2009. Steve Fletcher stepped down as executive director in 2012, a position now held by Anthony Newby 
 Membership is open to those who share the organization's goals and contribute throug member dues or volunteer efforts. There are four kinds of memebers: Full Members, Associate Members, Provisional Members, and Organizational Members. 
 In 2015 the offices were burnt down in an unsolved case of arson and fundraising were conducted to obtain new office space. Despite the fire the organization saw growth in the year; it now has 12 staff members, with paid positions. 
 Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 Fundraisers for the organization and particular events are held, member dues, and volunteering efforts are also accepted according to the bylaws. 
 Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 NOC focuses on a number of issues affecting under-resourced neighborhoods. These include fixing low wages with a federal $15/hr minimum, restoration of the vote after incarceration, police accountability, environmental education on climate change, access to quality public education, and minority representation in politics, among others. 
 Major Projects and Events Police accountabilityAccording to the NOC, their members have been beaten and harassed on multiple occasions by the Minneapolis police department. In particular, the arrest of civic and political engagement director Wintana Melekin and field organizer Navell Gordon led to a concerted push from the organization to get the city of Minneapolis to commit to investing in police body cameras. After more than a year of studying the matter, the city agreed. 
 Economic justiceIn August 2016 the NOC along with other grassroots activist groups of the Fed Up coalition presented their case against rate increases to the Federal Reserve meeting group at Jackson Hole. NOC activists argued that the Fed's policies might have created recovery for white Americans, but it has incentivized low wage growth among African-American and Hispanic communities. The meeting, usually restricted to monetary specialists and bankers, was a ""first of its kind"" given its inclusion of community activists, according to financial journalists.

The Danish Board of Technology Foundation also serves to provide Denmark with a solid basis with which to address technology issues involving other nations.  Origins and Development  Like all of today’s governmental bodies, the Danish Parliament often needs to make decisions about various uses of technology. These decisions can have a significant effect on public interests, from traffic, energy and agriculture to education, research and health. In order to help ensure that technology decisions are made wisely, the Parliament established the Danish Board of Technology (Teknologi-rådet) in 1986. The DBT changed its name to the Danish Board of Technology Foundation in 2012.  A few examples of the topics addressed by Foundation projects within the past five years are Copenhagen’s underground railway system, genetically modified foods, electronic self-service in the public sector and technological changes in elementary and junior high-level school.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The Board of Technology Foundation is comprised of a Board of Governors, a Board of Representatives and a secretariat of about 12 staff members. The Minister for Research is the supervising authority for the Board and the Parliament’s Research Committee is the Board’s liaison to Parliament.  The Board of Governors consists of the Chairperson of the DBT and ten additional members. The Board of Governors, which meets seven times a year, selects the projects which will be pursued, oversees the budget, and appoints the Director of the DBT.  The Minister for Research appoints the Chair of the Board of Governors and three of the members. The other members are appointed by the Minister on recommendation from the following organizations: The Industry and Trade Development Council, the Salaried Employees’ and Civil Servants’ Confederation, the Danish Confederation of Trade Unions, the Danish Employers’ Confederation, a joint representative of the National Association of Local Authorities and the Danish Association of County Councils, the Danish Council for Adult Education and the Danish Research Councils.  The Board of Representatives has up to 50 members and serves as a forum for open debate on topical issues related to technology assessment. The Minister for Research appoints up to ten representatives following a discussion with the Board of Governors. The other representatives are appointed based on recommendations from the above organizations, as well as many other Danish organizations.  The Board of Representatives has two meetings per year, one of which is earmarked for discussing the DBT’s work plans for the coming year’s projects. The other meeting is dedicated to discussion and evaluation of the work that has been completed throughout the year. Although they do not have decision-making power, members of the Board of Representatives serve as important resource persons for the DBT, generating ideas for new projects and providing valuable feedback on current projects.  The DBT identifies different target groups for involvement in and education about each of their projects. The Foundation targets people and organizations that are able to make decisions and take action on the technology issues at hand. The Danish Parliament, other government entities, the experts and the companies that develop the technologies are made aware of the Board’s assessments. Nonprofit organizations and social activists are also considered to be pivotal in any kind of change effort. And as citizens and consumers, the general public can influence developments and thus act as an important target group. If an area of technology is international by nature, foreign communities can also be target groups for the Board’s activities.  Although it is not directed by the Danish government, the DBT is funded by the government. The Foundation receives an annual subsidy of approximately 13 million Danish Kroner ($1.7 million). One third of the Board’s annual budget is designated for management and administrative expenses, one third for technology assessment (both expert and citizen technology assessment); and one third for public education.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The Danish Board of Technology Foundation (DBT) initiates projects based on their economic, democratic or environmental importance to a large number of people. A project’s topic may already be of interest to citizens and politicians, or there may be a clear need to increase awareness on the topic. The topics must have technological content, and are usually controversial topics that tend to cause conflict and make decision-making difficult. Special emphasis is placed on clarifying the interaction between technology, society and people.  The Foundation strives to ensure that technology in Denmark is in harmony with the desire for a democratic, fair and economically, ecologically and socially sustainable society. Depending on the project, this can translate into a need to utilize a familiar technique more effectively, a need to curb the misuse of new techniques and new technology, or a need to cultivate future advancements.  Building on the strong democratic traditions of Denmark, the Foundation helps to inform and generate debate and discussion on as broad a basis as possible. It makes use of expert knowledge as well as the insight, experience and credibility of non-expert citizens in its evaluation of technology. And it initiates relevant and important technology debates among various sectors of the public as well as among decision makers.  Although the DBT's technology assessments do not always conclude in recommendations for a solution, technology assessments often identify joint views, conflicts and options as the first step toward finding a solution. The Foundation must therefore create a foundation for clarifying views, visions and a debate on technology issues. To create this foundation, the DBT may seek expert analyses on technology issues, involve citizens directly in the technology assessment process, take steps to educate the general public on a particular issue, or do any combination of the three.  To ensure that both the need for factual, reliable information and the need for meaningful public participation are met, the DBT makes use of a variety of specific methods for evaluating technology. The Foundation has developed some of these methods itself, while others have been borrowed from international and other Danish institutions.  One of the most well known methods is the  consensus conference . These four-day events provide an opportunity for a small but representative group of citizens to engage in extensive dialogue with experts on a particular technological issue, to  deliberate  amongst themselves about possible action steps, and to then present consensus-based recommendations to the government and to the press. The Foundation has sponsored approximately 20 consensus conferences on such topics as electronic identity cards, genetically modified food, educational technology and the future of private automobiles, and their methods for using this model have been duplicated in many other countries.  Other methods are also used by the DBT to involve ordinary citizens, special interest groups, politicians and experts in the assessment of technology.  Scenario workshops , future search conferences, policy exercises, work groups, opinion polls and questionnaires are a few examples. The Foundation typically organizes one or two consensus conferences each year, one workshop a year, and multiple local citizen hearings about various topics.  The Foundation has also convened an alliance of public and private entities who developed the  World Wide Views methodology  for large-scale, multi-site public consultations on a single topic.It has been implemented on the multinational level on topics such as  climate and energy ,  global warming , and  biodiversity .  Major Projects and Events  Each year, the Danish Board of Technology Foundation (DBT) works on a number of different projects that assess technology and improve the public’s knowledge about the selected issues. The DBT calls upon members of Parliament, various organizations, businesses, and citizens annually for topic ideas for the coming year’s efforts.  The Board of Governors selects 20 possible projects from well over 100 suggestions. Staff members of the DBT then research the 20 issues to determine what work is already being done around the topic and to determine whether the Board of Technology’s methods would help. The staff synthesize their findings into 20 concise two-page reports, which are presented to the Board of Governors.  After the Board of Governors selects the six or seven projects that will become a part of the following year’s work plan, the staff members develop a detailed plan for each project which includes extensive background information, the concept and purpose of the project, the methods which would be most effective in addressing this issue, the groups which would be targeted for involvement, the ways in which information would be disseminated, the kind of impact that is anticipated, and a timetable and budget for the project. These project descriptions then go to the Board of Governors for approval.  Projects are organized under broad categories such as  information technology , culture/media, agriculture, environment/energy, health care, traffic and technology policy. The six projects selected for 2002 – from 172 total topic suggestions – cover such important and varied topics as genetically modified food and the third world; hydrogen in a renewable energy system; and making the cities great places to live.  A brief description of one of 2002’s projects, “How are we going to assign value to the environment?” is as follows:  ""How can we determine the price of environmental benefits and pollution so that these factors come to form part of an economic analysis in an acceptable way? The question of how we assign value to the environment has really become a topic of current interest, especially in the wake of the Ministry of Finance’s report on environmental policy’s benefits and costs. Recently, we have seen this in the cost-benefit analysis of particle-emissions from heavy vehicles. There are, however, serious methodological problems with how we can determine the monetary value of the environment.""  In addition to its various projects, the DBT serves as an advisor to the Danish Parliament and other government entities in a number of ways. The Foundation responds to specific questions that members of Parliament have about technology issues. It organizes hearings for parliamentary committees which bring in experts as resources on the particular issue being examined. The DBT sometimes approaches members of Parliament in relation to topical technology issues. And the Board of Governors submits statements to Parliament which summarize the results of a project.  Analysis and Lessons LearnedInfluence, Outcomes, and EffectsOnce a year, the Foundation submits a report to the Parliament which summarizes findings from the various projects. Reports are also prepared for each of the projects, and these are often used by academics and students. All of the reports are made available to the public on the Danish Board of Technology Foundation website, and the media helps to get the word out about the projects’ results.  Depending on what it wants to achieve and who it wants to reach with the information, the Foundation uses a variety of avenues to disseminate its work. The press is an important channel for conveying the DBT’s results. The Foundation’s target groups often include people who may not have the time to study all of the literature they receive, but who will follow developments in the newspapers, on the radio and on TV newscasts. Many people’s perception of whether there is an ongoing debate in a particular area is closely linked to the treatment of that topic in the media. The press is therefore an important tool in setting the agenda for public debate.  After a project is completed, the Foundation may decide that the topic needs and deserves further development so that it can be adapted for community meetings and other forums. To promote public education at the local level, the DBT provides financial support for local educational events, educational materials featuring facts and views from all sides of the debate, and lists of resources such as speakers, literature and films on the topic.  It is difficult to assess the Danish Board of Technology Foundation’s impact on specific technological issues. Since its aim is primarily to foster and inform debate and discussion about technology among both decision makers and citizens, a look at some of their activities illustrates that the Foundation is meeting this goal.  The Foundation has held hearings for members of the Danish Parliament on Copenhagen’s underground railway system. The have produced a report on the benefits and challenges of 100% organically-certified agriculture. They have organized a role play for  stakeholder groups  on choices and possibilities for energy consumption. They have led  workshops  and distributed brochures on possible technological advancements in elementary and junior high schools. And they have organized a consensus conference on the production and consumption of genetically modified foods. These are only a few examples of the Board’s numerous activities that have informed debate about technology issues.  Some of the Foundation’s activities have led to concrete political action. One consensus conference uncovered citizens’ strong position that blood tests should never be required for job applicants. The subject was then discussed in Parliament and, partly due to the consensus conference, blood tests were banned as requirements for employment in 1992.Strengths of the Organization's WorkAlthough technology has and will have an intense effect on people’s lives, most technology decisions are made outside of Parliament. Many important decisions are made by manufacturers of technology, and many more are made by citizens – the consumers of technology. The Danish Board of Technology Foundation does not focus solely on informing and influencing the Danish Parliament, but also informs and involves citizens, businesses, manufacturers, academics and others.  The DBT selects its projects very carefully, making sure that the topic is not only important, timely, contentious and relevant to policy, but also that it would not be better served by a different method of assessment. This careful selection, although time-consuming, increases the likelihood that the projects the Foundation administers will be successful and influential.  The DBT is well-respected by members of the Parliament, Danish educators and others who are familiar with the Foundation's work, and even internationally. Within the Danish Parliament, the Foundation enjoys a fair degree of multi-partisan support, although liberals are more supportive of their work than are conservatives.  When experts are requested to make assessments in order to provide an overview of the issue, the Foundation utilizes the best available expertise, often drawing experts in across professions and sectors, ensuring that many elements and different values are represented in the assessments. Interdisciplinary working groups of experts are sometimes established, and experts who disagree on the topic at hand are often brought in, ensuring that the results will not be biased.  Through its leadership in the consensus conference model of public engagement and decision-making, the Danish Board of Technology Foundation has helped answer one of today’s most difficult democratic problems: How can ordinary citizens make intelligent decisions about complicated and ever-changing technological issues? By providing a demographically (not politically) representative group of citizens with high-quality information and facilitation – and then feeding the results of that microcosmic dialogue back into the macrocosm of public discourse – democratic society is given appropriate wisdom to reflect and act upon.Challenges &amp; LimitationsThe Danish Board of Technology Foundation’s work often does not make an impact in Parliament. Although the DBT tries to set up meetings with the relevant committees in Parliament and always sends the reports, having members of Parliament attend such meetings and listen openly to the information that is presented is not common. The Foundation does, however, use other means to influence Parliament indirectly, such as having their findings reported on in the media, and informing citizens of the issues.  Another challenge that the DBT faces is that, although it is funded by Parliament, it is run independently of government influence and has to continually remind members of Parliament that it exists, and that it is available as a resource to them. The fact that the Danish Parliament does not usually initiate studies and projects adds to the difficulty. The DBT, however, has been successful since 1995 in taking on the role of arranging public hearings for the Parliament. With one or two months’ notice, the Foundation can organize a half-day or day-long public hearing which brings in a variety of experts on the issue and is open and publicized to the public. Members of Parliament are becoming more and more accustomed to utilizing this option.  Working within a reasonable and pre-determined time frame for its projects causes some challenges for the Foundation as well. Although the Foundation tries to judge the projects partly on timeliness, its reports often seem to be too early or too late to make an impact in Parliament. A report may be submitted years before the issue is considered in Parliament, or it may be submitted just a few months after a decision has been made.  Another limitation that the DBT currently faces is politicians’ lack of faith in and reluctance to rely on the ability of public participation methods to produce good decisions. A recent European study which examined the extent to which consensus conferences influence the legislative decisions of the Danish Parliament revealed that although 75% of the members of Parliament were familiar with consensus conferences, and about half of these had actually attended one, only 13% of those familiar with the model felt that the conferences sometimes led to parliamentary discussions, debates or initiatives, such as the issuance of laws or guidelines. According to the results of this study, the Foundation is facing a body which may not be receptive to one of its most innovative methods.PublicationsThe DBT also produces a range of publications focused on the goal of stimulating and informing discussion on technology issues. These publications are sent out to target groups, and they can be ordered from the Foundation. The DBT’s magazine, which is published six times annually, contains news stories, background information, articles and debates, all primarily related to the Foundation’s current projects. The Board’s newsletter, which is sent to members of Parliament, features short descriptions of current technology issues and problems as well as summaries of the Board’s work.

FCAB recommendations and advice provided the DOE with an understanding of the issues and concerns that were important to local stakeholders and ensured that these perspectives were incorporated into planning and decision making on the Fernald Environmental Management Project (FEMP) site.  The Department of Energy facility in Fernald, Ohio, was used to produce high-purity uranium metal for nuclear weapons from 1951 to 1989. During this period, over one million pounds of uranium were released into the surrounding environment.  In the late 1980s, the local public became aware of contamination caused by the site in the local groundwater, and in the soil and buildings at the site. Fernald was actually one of the first sites to become known nationally for acknowledged federal environmental mismanagement, and the problem was featured in 60 Minutes and as a cover story in Time Magazine. DOE was required to pay damages to local residents and to the state of Ohio and agreed to allow the state to oversee its waste disposal activities.  Conclusions and demands of local citizen groups, the US and Ohio EPA and the DOE managers at Fernald, all of whom were concerned about reducing the human health risk and environmental damage in the area, led to the creation of the Fernald Citizens Advisory Board (FCAB) in 1993. FCAB was established in order to provide policy and technical advice regarding important clean-up decisions to the regulated and regulating agencies. In 1995 it was deemed that over 3 million cubic yards of waste and contaminated material would need to be removed from the site.  The Board was to not only include the easily identifiable affected parties, but also individual residents who live in the vicinity of the site. It was to be small in size, involving less than 20 people, to have a clear mission, to include governmental officials as nonvoting members, to reflect the variety of views in the surrounding community and to attempt to reach consensus. Administrative and technical support was to be provided by the government.  FCAB was active until September 2006, at which point the clean-up was completed.  History  The United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) produced nuclear weapons for the US Cold War effort. To this end it also managed 21 facilities in 13 states, together named the Nuclear Weapons Complex. In 1951, the AEC began construction of a uranium production facility 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati, Ohio. Titled the Feed Materials Production Center, it was situated on 1050 acres and was situated near the community of Fernald. It employed 2800 individuals and produced most of the uranium used in US Nuclear Weapons production.  Controversy struck the site when, in 1984, a faulty dust collector at one of the plants released nearly 300 pounds of enriched uranium oxide into the environment. It was also revealed at that time that uranium had contaminated three off-site wells just three years earlier. Since the community sits above the Great Miami Aquiver, one of the largest drinking water aquifers in the country, these revelations caused great concern and anger. The community filed a class action lawsuit against the Department of Energy (DOE, previously known as the AEC) and five years later received compensation of $73 million.  Nevertheless, in 1989, the Environmental Protection Agency added Fernald to a list of the country’s worst waste sites. After much public campaigning, particularly by the Fernald Residents for Environmental Safety and Health (FRESH), the DOE in 1991 decided to change its mission regarding the Fernald site entirely to environmental remediation. The main contractor, Westinghouse, hired to manage the Fernald site, was replaced by the Fernald Environmental Restoration Management Company (FERMCO, which later became Fluor Fernald) in order to focus management completely on the clean-up and closure of the site.  While the DOE communicated with the local community according to the minimum regulatory requirements, the residents were eager to have a much greater involvement in the project. In response to their repeated calls for involvement, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established a forum called the Federal Facilities Environmental Restoration Dialogue Committee (FFERDC), which would provide a blueprint for all stakeholders to bring about creative solutions to the problems facing federal facilities. DOE managers at the Fernald site decided to implement this mechanism. This led to the establishment of the Fernald Citizens Task Force in 1993, which then changed its name to the Fernald Citizens Advisory Board in 1997. It met over a 13-year period in order to provide recommendations for the better management of the remediation process.  Organizational Structure and and Funding  The originating and funding organisation is the U.S. Department of Energy. Its general mission is to meet and manage the United States’ energy and environmental needs. It was established in 1977 to consolidate the federal government’s activities in the energy sector and facilitate the establishment of a national energy plan. Prior to the DOE, activities relating to atomic energy had been managed by the Atomic Energy Commission. The entire clean-up project is estimated to have cost $4.4 billion.Participant SelectionA maximum of 15 members served on the FCAB. These included labor representatives, local government officials, representatives from a local environmental activist group, academia and local business representatives, along with a number of non-voting members from DOE, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Ohio EPA, and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. Members came from neighboring communities, local governments, trade unions and area universities.  The first members were appointed by the DOE Assistant Secretary for Environmental Restoration and Waste Management. Subsequent new members were appointed by the Manager of the Ohio Field Office. Members were chosen from a list prepared by a committee of the Advisory Board which contained the details of citizens who had shown interest in the position. To ensure continuity of membership, half of the initial board members agreed to serve two-year terms and the other half agreed to three-year terms, although approximately 75% of the original members still served on the Board nearly 10 years after first being established. FCAB members received no compensation for their time, but travel expenses were reimbursed.  FCAB sought to maintain a diverse membership with perspectives that spanned the broad range of individuals and groups who were affected by the remediation and future use of the Fernald site. In order to protect against bias, an outside convener was hired to interview, screen and select the participants.  Specializations and Activities  Full board meetings and sub-committee meetings were held monthly, typically lasting approximately four hours and two hours, respectively. Recommendations and comments of the Advisory Board were made by consensus, while during votes for formal recommendations 3/5ths of the votes were required to make a decision official. Central items, such as budget and remediation progress, were evaluated by the full board, while committees with three to five members worked on more long-term and in-depth projects. FCAB tackled topics and issues that were important to the local community and relevant to constructive citizen input.  Guided by a Chair and Vice Chair from within the membership of the group, FCAB also received facilitation support from an independent and neutral consultant. The consultant served as the facilitator during all FCAB meetings and sub-committee meetings. A staff member of the Fernald DOE Public Affairs Department devoted a substantial portion of her time to FCAB as well.  Four public affairs staff members at the Department of Energy’s Ohio office simultaneously served as “counselors” who bridged the gap between the public and specific DOE projects (water, soils, etc.). These counselors prepared for FCAB meetings and other public participation events by anticipating what questions the public may have had and obtaining answers at staff meetings and other venues.  FCAB members recognized that their small group, however diverse, could not represent every viewpoint of the public. In order to obtain broader input from the public about some of the more controversial issues and to demonstrate their own independence from the Department of Energy, FCAB conducted its own public outreach efforts. The Board held various well-publicized meetings, workshops and presentations to increase public understanding and involvement in the remediation.  Major Projects and Events  Initially, FCAB was charged with the task of providing the DOE, the U.S. EPA and the Ohio EPA with recommendations regarding four primary questions: What should be the future of the Fernald site? What residual risk and remediation levels should remain following remediation? Where should the waste be disposed? What should be the priorities among remedial actions?  The Department of Energy estimated that FCAB’s subsequent recommendations saved the taxpayers more than $2 billion over the lifetime of the project. This substantial savings is partly due to FCAB’s call for the acceleration of cleanup efforts (to be completed by 2006 instead of the DOE’s original 2020 goal). The amended cleanup estimate of $2.9 billion – $4.3 billion less than the original $7.2 billion estimate – resulted from years of savings in building maintenance expenses, salaries for workers and a number of other expenses. FCAB also saved a significant amount by recommending that 80% of the FEMP site’s waste remain on-site, and that off-site disposal be limited to 20% of the waste. Since it would have cost three times more to ship the waste than to construct the on-site disposal facility, an additional $700 million was saved.  However, after these issues were addressed in 1995 through a report, the FCAB continued to operate as an important citizen voice in the continued restoration efforts. The FCAB’s recommendations had a strong influence on policy decisions, mainly because of the high regard public officials had for their process. Managers at the Department of Energy in Fernald developed respect for the group and their work after reviewing the 1995 report. Many of the managers were surprised by the depth to which the group studied the issues involved, and the sound analysis of information and practical fact-based recommendations generated the managers’ respect toward the members of FCAB.Outcomes and EffectsThe biggest achievements of the FCAB over 13 years include:Making high quality decisions that improved effectiveness of clean-up, saved time and money, and reduced the risks to the community and workers  Taking a balanced approach to clean-up, such that, future uses of the site would be restricted, but the amount of soil needing removal was reduced  Appealing to the Secretary of Energy for quicker removal of special nuclear materials so that clean-up was not delayed and costs saved  Appealing to the DOE for a redesign to the clean-up system so that aquifer clean-up could proceed with less uranium contamination  Convincing the DOE to use trains to transport contaminated materials instead of trucks, thereby reducing transportation risks and saving costs and time  Recommending the creation of a Critical Analysis Team, whose activities ended up improving project efficiencies, reducing risk, and preventing costly delays  Bringing concerns about powdery waste in a silo to the DOE’s attention, which led to it being contained with a sticky liquid such that it could not become airborne  Urging the DOE to seek offsite storage for waste in aging silos at a facility in Texas  Championing issues that might otherwise have been ignored, for example the repatriation of Native American remains at the site, planning for long-term stewardship and public use of the site, and public access to information after closure of the project  Facilitating good working relationships between stakeholders, which included the public, the DOE, contractors, and federal and state regulators  Facilitating public awareness and education of stakeholders on technical issues as well as the particular interests held by different actors involved. This allowed decision-makers to integrate the various interests into effective policy  Establishing an effective decision-making process that became a model for Advisory Boards at other DOE environmental management sites in the countryOn average, between three and eight recommendations were made by FCAB each year. The recommendations they provided began broadly (the site should be available for public recreational use), and then focused on particular suggestions (the network of trails should be of this type, and in these locations; records should be housed in this type of facility), and always included detailed information about how conclusions were made.  Analysis and Criticism  Since the same small group of individuals met face-to-face over a long period of time, FCAB facilitated the exchange of information and viewpoints and the in-depth understanding of the topic at hand. Trust was built among the participants and, even if the group was unable to reach consensus on a particular issue, areas of disagreement were narrowed, conflicting parties recognized others’ concerns as legitimate, new alternatives and ideas emerged and, at the very least, the issues on the table became more clear to all parties.  FCAB was able to tackle contentious issues that involved stakeholders with conflicting values and needs. Since FCAB worked at the local level, its members had a significant stake in the issues the board addressed and were accountable for its results. The board contributed to a better-informed public, more sustainable solutions to complicated problems, improved relationships among stakeholders and between government officials and citizens, and increased public buy-in for government decisions and programs.  One senior DOE official told the Presidential/Congressional Commission on Risk Assessment and Risk Management: “The Department [of Energy] has learned the power of having the public involved in decision-making. For example, the Citizens Advisory Board at Fernald has dramatically changed the department’s cleanup strategy at that Ohio site. The results will be a far more expeditious cleanup, with a savings of some $2 billion compared with the cost of the department’s original plans. By opening the process to meaningful public input, the department is empowered to make decisions it could never make unilaterally.”  There were challenges and limitations, too, however. A surprisingly high number of the original participants still served on the FCAB towards the end of the project. A tightly-knit, highly informed and active group could intimidate potential new members, preventing the Board from evolving and ensuring that qualified people had the opportunity to serve on the Board.  FCAB went through an awkward, uncertain stage after it completed its initial report in 1995 but decided to continue meeting. It was some time (18 to 24 months) before the DOE realized that FCAB needed to have a specific task to focus on in order to be effective. One alternative which would have addressed this and the previous problem would have been to establish new FCABs – with new memberships – each time the Fernald facility or state DOE needed to obtain informed public input on a complex issue.  Running FCAB was time consuming and resource intensive. It required genuine support from the convening agency, including financial support, information, guidance, time and expertise.  FCAB’s recommendations were taken seriously by managers at the Fernald DOE. FCAB had a strong influence on policy decisions, but this influence was not guaranteed. The public officials involved with the Fernald facility developed a great deal of respect for the FCAB members and their recommendations. Working closely with senior management at DOE, convincing them that citizen participation was important and worthwhile and that it was worth their time and effort to go beyond what was required of management was very important for FCAB’s success.  Overall, after 13 years of operation, four valuable lessons were learned that would be useful for similar projects in the future: 1) Create a clear focus for the Advisory Board. This means having a well-reasoned work plan, making decisions with a solid understanding of the context in which the decision is being made, and understanding the relationships to other organisations such that an efficient division of labor can be established. 2) Create a strong administrative structure. This largely involves ensuring a clear group structure and understanding of the ground rules, using the committees to address big issues, assessing the strengths and drawbacks of membership terms, and evaluating work achieved on a regular basis in order to improve for the coming period. 3) Use a consensus-based decision making process. The successes of FCAB were significantly due to the manner in which decisions were approached. These were often based on good information gained through group learning and information sharing. Collaboration among stakeholders and outside facilitation were also frequently made use of. Importantly, a good sense of humor and efforts to enjoy the time spent together allowed for group cohesion. 4) Create effective outreach and communications. While the FCAB maintained a strong relationship with the community, local governments were regrettably not engaged with as often. Another weakness found was that, despite a strong working relationship at the start, FCAB were not able to maintain effective ties with DOE Headquarters towards the end of the project. This is believed to have diminished the influence of the Advisory Board at that time.Secondary Sources  Interviews conducted by Sandy Heierbacher with Sue Walpole, the FEMP site’s Technical Liaison to the FCAB, Gary Stegner, Deputy Designated Federal Official, and John Applegate, former FCAB Chair.

HEI receives half of its core funds from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and half from the motor vehicle industry. HEI has funded over 170 studies and published over 100 research reports, producing important research findings on the health effects of a variety of pollutants such as carbon monoxide and diesel exhaust.  The HEI research program has addressed many important questions about the health effects associated with exposure to both regulated pollutants such as carbon monoxide, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide, and unregulated pollutants such as diesel exhaust and methanol. HEI has also funded studies to understand the mechanisms of diseases, to develop better methods to assess health effects and to determine dose response relationships.  HEI has two main goals in funding research. One is to build a coherent research program for each set of related studies, thereby addressing questions that are more comprehensive than would be possible with independent studies. Another is to provide timely, high-quality information to its sponsors and government agencies in order to help them make more informed technological and regulatory decisions. In order to accomplish these goals, HEI works cooperatively with investigators and keeps in close contact with them through such means as progress reports, workshops and its annual conference.  Organizational Structure and Funding  Two independent committees, the Health Research Committee and the Health Review Committee, work separately on selecting and overseeing research and critically reviewing results. This separation permits HEI to fund and guide research and to provide credible peer review of that same research. A scientific and administrative staff works with the committees to conduct the Institute’s business.  Each year HEI holds an annual conference that investigators are expected to attend. The annual conference provides an opportunity for HEI’s sponsors to learn more about HEI studies, for HEI to receive feedback on its research program and for networking among investigators, Research and Review Committee members, sponsor representatives and HEI staff. Abstracts of each investigator’s work are published in the annual conference booklet. In addition to discussion of HEI program areas, the annual conference generally includes special symposia on broader issues of current interest.  Periodically, small workshops are organized which bring together investigators who are working on projects in a particular research area. These meetings offer an opportunity for investigators doing related research to get a better understanding of each other’s research and to explore opportunities for coordination of studies. Critical gaps in HEI’s program and ideas for new research may also be identified as a result of these workshops.  HEI, which considers itself to be a partnership of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and industry, is sponsored primarily by the U.S. EPA (including the Office of Research and Development and the Office of Air and Radiation) and by the motor vehicle industry (Ford Motor Company, General Motors Corporation, Volkswagen of America, Inc. and 24 others). Other sponsors include the American Chemistry Council, the American Petroleum Institute, and Europe’s Association des Constructeurs Européens d'Automobiles.Participant SelectionThe Health Research Committee is responsible for defining, implementing, and overseeing the Institute’s research program. The Health Research Committee’s 10 members are prominent professors and senior scientists, with such titles as Professor and Chairman of the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Pittsburgh’s Graduate School of Public Health and Senior Scientist and Deputy Director at the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute’s National Environmental Respiratory Center.  Since 1980, several hundred physicians, toxicologists, biochemists, epidemiologists, exposure experts, engineers and statisticians from leading research institutions in the U.S. and Europe have either served on the Research Committee or as a special reviewer of research proposals.  The Health Review Committee conducts a critical, in-depth evaluation of every HEI-funded study. The Health Review Committee’s 11 members are also professors and renowned scientists, which such titles as Vice President for Analytical and Chemical Sciences at the Research Triangle Institute and Professor at the University of Chicago’s Biological Sciences Division and Harris School of Public Policy.  Committee members complete four-year terms (renewable for a second term). After they have completed their term, Health Review Committee members may apply to be considered for Health Research Committee membership, although Research Committee members are required to wait several years before applying to serve on the Review Committee in order to prevent a situation in which a Review Committee member is evaluating a research project they oversaw while on the Research Committee.  Selection of members is based on the current and anticipated needs of the committees. The type of expertise that is sought depends on the research that is being completed or planned for, and the current types of expertise that are available on the committees. The Health Research Committee meets three times a year for two-day meetings, while the Health Review Committee meets three or four times annually for one- or two-day meetings. Committee members receive a daily honorarium of $600 for the time they provide at these meetings and for additional work they choose to take on.Specializations and Activities  The Health Research Committee consults with HEI’s sponsors and other stakeholders to determine research priorities and to develop the HEI strategic plan. Members of the public are given the opportunity at HEI’s national conference to learn about and respond to various ideas and plans for future research. In this way, public involvement is incorporated at the beginning of a cycle of research, ensuring that stakeholders can provide input and advice before the 5-year strategic plans for research are developed.  Once the Research Committee has defined an area of inquiry, the Institute issues a request for applications to announce broadly to the scientific community that research applications are being solicited. Applications are first reviewed for scientific quality by an ad hoc panel, and then reviewed by the Research Committee, which seeks to develop an integrated research program. Studies recommended by the Research Committee undergo a final evaluation by the Board of Directors, which also reviews the procedures, independence and quality of the selection process.  The Research Committee may request modifications in the project plan or budget before making a final funding recommendation to the HEI Board of Directors. For example, the Research Committee may request deletion of parts of the proposed project that are less relevant to HEI’s objectives or overlap considerably with other studies. This approach enables HEI to mold diverse investigator-designed studies into a more coherent program and to generate data more relevant to regulatory needs. HEI staff scientists act as liaisons between the Research Committee and investigators in this scientific negotiation process. The end product is a project plan that is acceptable to both the investigator and Research Committee.  HEI’s Research Agreement is a cost-reimbursement contract rather than a grant. Contracts are usually issued for one year, although HEI expects to provide support for the number of years initially approved by the Research Committee if work is progressing satisfactorily. Studies typically range from 1 year to 3 years. Very rarely does HEI decide not to renew a contract, and very rarely do researchers abandon their HEI projects before they are completed.  The Research Agreement has been designed to maximize the integrity of the scientific process while providing needed protections and meeting applicable federal regulations. Once a contract is signed by both parties, an Abstract and Statement of Work written by the principal investigator is distributed to the Institute’s sponsors. These are also available to members of the public who request them.  HEI sometimes conducts site visits to the laboratories of its funded investigators during the course of their studies. The site visit team consists of members of the HEI Research Committee, HEI scientific staff, and outside consultants. The purpose of these visits is to evaluate the status of the project, to provide the investigator with expert technical advice, and to provide an opportunity for an exchange of ideas between the investigator and other experts in the field.  At HEI’s annual meeting, each investigator presents information about their ongoing work. This gives sponsors and representatives from all of the various stakeholder groups the opportunity to examine and respond to the research findings throughout the entire research process.  HEI works with the principal investigators, the Research Committee and staff to build a coordinated program of related studies. The program is designed to provide more comprehensive answers to questions of regulatory significance than would be possible with independent studies. Throughout the course of each study, HEI monitors progress through periodic reports, workshops, presentations at the Institute’s Annual Conference and site visits. When a study is completed and the investigator has submitted a final report, the Research Committee’s involvement with the study ceases.  The Health Review Committee, which is not involved with the ongoing studies in any way, assesses the scientific quality of each investigator’s final report and evaluates the study’s contribution to unresolved scientific questions. The objectives of the extensive and rigorous HEI review process are to (1) evaluate the scientific quality and significance of the research, (2) point out the strengths and limitations of the study, (3) place the study into scientific and regulatory perspective, (4) identify future research opportunities and (5) communicate all the findings (positive and negative) to the Institute’s sponsors and the public. HEI then communicates the complete findings of the studies it funds in Research Reports.  The Health Effects Institute goes to great lengths to share the final results of the research projects with all of the various stakeholders – the motor vehicle industry, environmentalists, government officials, scholars and others. For high-impact studies that have significant policy implications or which may cause controversy, the Review Committee holds briefings for their industry and government sponsors, during which they not only present and explain the results, but also give people the opportunity to ask questions, make comments and express concerns. After the Investigator has issued their report and before the Research Report is produced, however, only the Review Committee and its consultants provide input and suggest changes.  HEI’s high-quality, bias-free methods have won them the support and respect of all of the various stakeholder groups. Because of the trust HEI has earned within these groups, the research results tend to be accepted by the stakeholders even when they conflict with a particular group’s views or needs.  In addition to its longer term research program, HEI is called upon periodically to conduct special reviews and projects that address particular areas of science. Some examples of special projects are: a review of the health effects of asbestos in public and commercial buildings, a critical review and reanalysis of key studies of the links between particulate air pollution and mortality, and comprehensive scientific literature reviews of the health effects of diesel exhaust and oxygenated fuels. For each review, the HEI Board of Directors appoints an expert panel to work with the staff to conduct or oversee the project. The special reports describing this work go through an independent peer review process before they are published.Major Events and Publications  Progress reports prepared by the Principal Investigators are reviewed by the HEI Research Committee and staff. Investigators are required to submit progress reports twice during the first year of the study, and once a year thereafter. The comprehensive final report produced at the end of each study undergoes an in-depth review by the HEI Review Committee and additional experts.  The basic objective of the reports is to indicate how much progress has been made in the development of experimental procedures, which objectives have been completed, and what problems, if any, have arisen. The first report is actually a combined progress report and renewal application for the following year’s funding. HEI’s decision regarding renewal of the contract is based upon the information provided by the investigator in this report. The report should provide a detailed account of the experimental results obtained during the funding period, as well as a work plan and a budget for the coming year. Progress reports are reviewed by the Research Committee and by HEI’s scientific staff.  The final reports prepared by the Principal Investigators describe the studies and their findings in detail. The HEI Review Committee, which has no role in either the selection or the supervision of the research projects, evaluates the final reports and produces Research Reports, which consist of one or more related Investigators’ Reports and the Health Review Committee’s commentary on those reports. The commentary discusses the strengths and limitations of the studies and puts the findings in both scientific and regulatory (policy) contexts. With each Research Report, the Institute also publishes a one-page statement, written for nonscientists, which summarizes the scientific background and rationale for funding the study, the investigator’s approach and methods, the key findings, and the Committee’s interpretation of the study.  Each draft final report is peer-reviewed by scientists with appropriate technical expertise, including a Biostatistician. A compilation of the comments of the reviewers, together with the Review Committee's initial review, is sent to the investigator, who has an opportunity to respond to these comments and, if necessary, to revise the report. Occasionally, the Review Committee may request additional analyses or other major changes. After any revisions are made, the Review Committee prepares its commentary. The investigator is also given the opportunity to provide feedback on the commentary prior to publication.  The Research Reports are the principle means by which HEI communicates the results of its research and review processes. HEI typically distributes its Research Reports without charge to the Environmental Protection Agency, the motor vehicle industry and other sponsors, the scientific community, public interest groups and biomedical libraries. The Reports are also listed on national databases and are available on HEI’s website. In addition, HEI urges all investigators to publish the results of their work in peer-reviewed scientific literature, and hundreds of such contributions have been published.  In 2001, HEI published its 150th Investigator’s Report. At the same time, the Review Committee produced its first HEI Perspectives, a new type of document that summarizes and interprets for decision makers and nonscientists the results of the most recent HEI research.  HEI studies have resulted in many important reports which have informed and influenced policy. A ten-year research project on diesel emissions, for example, resulted in the publication of a special report entitled Diesel Exhaust: A Critical Analysis of Emissions, Exposure, and Health Effects in April of 1995. The results of this study were used to inform regulatory assessments by the by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the California Air Resources Board and the World Health Organization.Analysis and Lessons LearnedStrengthsHEI’s greatest asset is its reputation. It is a highly respected, well-trusted organization whose work is not dismissed, even when powerful entities may feel threatened by the implications of its results. This reputation has enabled HEI to influence government regulations and policies. But there are many factors which contribute to HEI’s good reputation.  By obtaining joint support from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and industry, HEI allows groups with very different needs, concerns and interests to be involved in every stage of the research process. This ensures stakeholder groups and the public that HEI’s work will not be designed to serve the needs of a particular stakeholder group.  By building a coherent research program for each set of related studies, HEI is able to address complicated, multi-dimensional questions and issues. Giving investigators the opportunity to learn about each other’s research and to explore opportunities for collaboration strengthens the individual research projects as well as the larger research program.  By having the two committees – the Health Research Committee and the Health Review Committee – work independently on selecting and overseeing research and on critically reviewing results, HEI has created a checks and balances system for itself. HEI can fund and guide research projects while also providing credible post-study peer review of the same projects. This helps to ensure unbiased reviewing, and builds people’s trust in the research results.  HEI requires that appropriate quality assurance procedures are in place for all approved research projects that may produce data of regulatory significance. This policy assures HEI’s sponsors and the public that the data has been obtained under well-defined conditions and is reliable, traceable and replicable.  The Health Effects Institute involves many different stakeholder groups in many stages of the research and review process. Stakeholder groups are consulted and given the opportunity to provide input in the research design process, they may stay informed and provide input throughout the research projects, and they are informed of the projects’ results.  Providing access to data from studies of the health effects of pollutants is an important element in ensuring credibility, especially for studies used in controversial policy debates. HEI provides access to data about its studies in a manner that facilitates the review and validation of the work while protecting the confidentiality of any subjects who may have participated in the study and respecting the intellectual interests of the investigators who conducted the study.Challenges and LimitationsFinancial constraints are a major and obvious limitation that the Health Effects Institute faces on an ongoing basis. Until about a year ago, HEI’s base funding was the same amount as it had been for nearly 15 years. With the escalating cost of research, HEI is limited in the number and type of research projects it is able to fund. This leaves many important questions unanswered, and many talented researchers un-hired.  One challenge that HEI faces is caused by its unique research and review procedure. Many scientific researchers are accustomed to a research process in which the researchers are able to simply move on at the end of their project. HEI’s investigators, however, are expected to go through a fairly lengthy (up to 8-month) peer review process after their project and report are complete. During this time period, the investigators often move on intellectually, and are sometimes not fully involved in the review process.  The Health Effects Institute is a scientific research institution and not, strictly speaking, a public participation entity. The Institute lacks easy ways for members of the public to provide input into the process. If a member of the public is interested in learning about and responding to research that is in progress, he or she needs to learn about HEI’s annual conference and pay to attend the event. Members of the public do not have a liaison at HEI who they can email with comments. They do not have the opportunity to attend public forums which solicit their ideas and feedback. And aside from information provided at the conferences, they do not have access to information about research that is in progress.Secondary Sources  Interviews conducted by Sandy Heierbacher with Robert O’Keefe, Vice President of the Health Effects Institute; Aaron J.

Their website can be accessed at  https://www.kychamber.com/issues/issues/public-policy-councilsMission and Purpose  The Kentucky Center for Public Issues (KCPI) is an independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit public policy organization based in Frankfort, Kentucky’s capital. KCPI’s mission is to help citizens explore, understand and confront issues critical to the future of Kentucky.  KCPI organizes community forums on contentious issues, administers research for the Kettering Foundation, and provides training for the agencies involved in the area’s welfare reform. In addition, KCPI publishes a quarterly magazine called the Kentucky Journal and co-sponsors a public affairs radio program at the University of Louisville. KCPI often works in partnership with the University of Louisville to develop public affairs programs, to identify and coordinate research projects and to provide internships for students and faculty.  One of KCPI’s unique contributions to the state of Kentucky is their Policy Councils. Policy Councils involve a diverse group of experts and interested citizens from all parts of the state to consider and, if appropriate, propose improvements in public policies. Policy Councils study a specific contentious issue in depth, obtain public input and raise public awareness about the issue, arrive at a consensus about the issue when possible, and sometimes take action on their findings.  History  KCPI organized their first Policy Council about 12 years ago [1990] in response to the then-contentious issue of whether Kentucky governors should be able to serve two terms. There was much debate and conflict in the state legislature about this topic and KCPI, a respected non-partisan public policy organization, was approached by a large group of stakeholders from various constituencies to help mediate the problem.  KCPI set out to create a model that could successfully address a highly volatile issue about which many people hold strong opinions that are based on varying perspectives and often insufficient data. The result was their first Policy Council, comprised of members who represented a wide range of disciplines (scholars, lawyers, governors, citizens, etc.) so that every group involved felt that their perspective was being heard.  The Policy Council began by researching gubernatorial succession in other states. After deliberating about various options and soliciting the knowledge and perspectives of others who were not part of the Council, a number of possible methods for resolving the issue were developed. The Policy Council began educating stakeholder groups and the public about the various possibilities for action (amendment, railroading legislation through, etc.). After numerous meetings between KCPI representatives and state legislators, the Kentucky legislature drafted a constitutional amendment which would allow gubernatorial succession.  The amendment, which would require the approval of two-thirds of those voting, was placed on the ballot in 1992. The amendment passed, and was put to use for the first time in 1998, when Governor Paul Patton ran for office to succeed himself and was re-elected.Organizational Structure, Funding and Participant Selection  The first three Policy Councils boasted memberships of up to 140 people, but KCPI has found that it is most effective to involve between 30 and 40 members on the Councils. Currently, no more than 60 people serve on any one Policy Council.  Most Policy Councils create between four and nine subcommittees to address specific issues or problems. The subcommittees, whose members come from within the Policy Council, make regular reports to the Council. Graduate Assistants provided by the University of Louisville conduct research for the Policy Councils, as do subcommittee members.  KCPI tries to ensure that Policy Council membership is representative of the diverse points of view held on the subject and includes local experts and decision makers on the issue being addressed. The opportunity to serve on a Policy Council is publicized in newspaper editorials, in KCPI’s Kentucky Journal, on public radio, and through KCPI’s well-connected Board of Directors. Policy Council members go through a well-publicized nomination process, and KCPI’s 40-member Board approves the Council membership. Stakeholder groups, political viewpoints and racial and ethnic groups which are underrepresented among the applicants are actively recruited.  People with leadership abilities and decision-making power are included in each Policy Council. These people can help move the process along and convince others of its importance, both during and after the life of the Council. It is also considered vital that participants have some sense of political realities, an understanding of the basic issues involved and the ability to think analytically.  Since Kentucky is a very region-oriented state, with very few urban areas and little migration, Policy Councils must include representatives from many different regions throughout the state. Since the issues being tackled are fairly technical and not always interesting to the general public, obtaining this representation can be challenging.  In addition to the Policy Council and the subcommittees, additional committees are often formed around the issue at hand. Generally, there are two Policy Council members and one KCPI staff member involved in these committees, which consist primarily of citizens who cannot commit to serving on the Policy Council. School board members, citizen leaders, experts in the issue and others may serve on these committees, which report to the Policy Council.Specializations and Activities  The KCPI Board of Directors decides when to create a new Policy Council based on outside requests and the atmosphere around the issue and importance of the issue in the state. Requests usually come from experts who have examined the issue in depth, although KCPI makes it clear to these individuals that the outcome of the Policy Council may not be in congruence with their personal perspective or expectations for the process.  Meetings are guided by a strong facilitator, but Council members do not agree on ground rules or any kind of rules of conduct during meetings. An agenda is followed and notes are taken, but meetings tend to be relatively informal, driven by topic instead of set procedure. Generally, everyone present has an opportunity to contribute to the discussion when the question at hand relates to values; if the topic is more fact-based, discussion moves more quickly, with fewer people contributing data.  KCPI emphasizes that its Policy Councils allow for an open and honest, ongoing inquiry about an issue. Often, specific members agree to undertake research on a particular item independently, and then present their findings to the Council. Such presentations are followed by lively analysis and exchange of ideas and lots of vigorous (though civil) debate. If a particular member of the Council is completely inflexible in his or her views, unable to see other perspectives as valid and dominates the discussion, that person may be removed from the Council.  Policy Councils often organize “town meetings” across the state in order to obtain public input and raise public awareness of the issue. The meetings are widely publicized, large meetings in which there are some presentations about the issue and everyone present has the opportunity to speak. The meetings themselves tend to receive a significant amount of media coverage, resulting in even more public education.  Policy Councils tend to meet every three months, with subcommittee meetings in between. The work of the Councils takes time, because the problems they are examining and for which they are seeking solutions are systemic problems with multiple causes. Solutions to such problems are difficult to implement, and much time and effort needs to be spent on educating the public, stakeholder groups and government officials in order to make implementation more feasible, whether such implementation is administered by the Policy Councils or not. KCPI’s strong media plan for Policy Councils is invaluable for this reason.  Communication in between Council and subcommittee meetings is necessary to ensure the success of a Policy Council. Email discussion lists are established so that communication can take place quickly and efficiently within the large group. Printed materials are often sent to Council members in between meetings for them to examine.Outcomes and EffectsKCPI emphasizes that the Policy Councils produce and distribute useful information about possible solutions. A Council’s work may eventually lead to a resolution, but the Councils do not “drive the policy.” A Council’s task is to seek diverse viewpoints on an issue, obtain all of the relevant facts and distribute their findings. The documentation that is produced does not make a specific recommendation. Instead, it presents the various viewpoints and possibilities for action.  The Policy Council on gubernatorial succession, however, was considered by many to be a success largely because their work was able to influence legislators and voters to such a degree that a constitutional amendment was written and then accepted into law.  KCPI assumes that the group which initially proposed the issue to them will follow up on the findings, but it is sometimes the case that the stakeholders and officials who are involved in the Councils will take steps to increase the likelihood of the findings being translated into action. KCPI, in fact, targets certain influential groups (government officials, lawyers, professors, etc.) for membership in the Councils, so that the Councils have the power that is needed to persuade legislators to take action on the issue if needed.  This may seem contradictory to the Policy Councils’ purpose, but it is a natural outcome of involving citizens in examinations of contentious policy issues. When people examine issues that effect the communities in which they live and find possible solutions to a problem, they will want to implement the solutions or help others to do so. If the information they produced was not utilized in this way, they may not consider their efforts to have been successful, even if KCPI considers them to be successful because they increased citizen awareness of the issue and provided documentation of diverse viewpoints and various possibilities for action.  To ensure that Policy Council members maintain neutrality, KCPI makes sure that the members understand that they are expected to “check their prejudices and preferences at the door.” Members have to keep their minds open while they examine every angle of the issues – varying points of view, different political stances, etc. Because of the public forums, meetings and research in which the Policy Councils involve the public, Policy Councils reach decisions that give strong consideration to public opinion.  Despite the lack of a concrete link to action, KCPI believes that 90% of the people who have participated in Policy Councils feel that their work with the Council was worthwhile. Policy Councils offer people a chance to examine an important issue in an open and neutral fashion, to have their findings published, to contribute to the understanding and exposition of an issue and to possibly have an impact on that issue in the long term.  Publications  The final reports of the Policy Councils are typically written by talented people on the Councils, edited multiple times and then approved by the entire Policy Council (without the KCPI board’s involvement). The length of a Policy Council’s final report tends to be between 20 and 30 pages long. A two-page executive summary of the report is distributed to the media, the people who attended the public forums, public officials, relevant state agencies, organizations and individuals who are affiliated with the issue, and virtually everyone who is affiliated with the Policy Council. People who are highly influential in state politics are targeted to receive the summaries (state legislators, judges, lawyers, etc.). Due to the cost of reproducing it, the larger report is generally only distributed to the Chairs of the steering Committees, board members, and members of the Policy Councils, but is available to any citizen, agency or organization upon request.Analysis and Lessons LearnedStrengthsKCPI’s Policy Councils provide a forum for an open and honest inquiry among a diverse group of experts and citizens into an important policy issue. Even if the membership of the Policy Council is not fully representative of the state of Kentucky, the final report that is produced reflects the views, perspectives and needs of all Kentuckians.  KCPI – and, to a large extent, the Policy Councils – remain neutral and refrain from advocating for a particular plan of action. This makes KCPI better able to attract members and participants with diverse views and experiences, thereby ensuring that their dialogue and deliberation will be richer, and that their end product will be more accurate and useful. It also prevents KCPI from being perceived as a threat by government officials and other stakeholder groups, which makes it easier for the Policy Councils’ activities and products to garner support.  A public relations strategy is needed for any state-wide endeavor which seeks to involve and educate the public. KCPI has created a media plan for their Policy Councils which details how print media, electronic media and speakers bureaus should be utilized from month one through 24 of a Council. This includes an on-going editorial distribution policy, how to utilize local public and cable television, and the disbursement of media packets. Public relations staff are sometimes hired to handle such tasks, and town meetings and other public forums are organized by paid staff instead of volunteers.  Although establishing new Policy Councils is not easy, the fact that KCPI needs to begin anew with every issue they decide to explore with the model means that the expertise, variety of perspective and type of influence that is needed for a particular issue can be sought for and hopefully obtained. Having run Policy Councils since 1989, KCPI is equipped with the ongoing infrastructure and expertise needed for establishing new Councils, and is better able to address an array of problems in Kentucky effectively over time because of it.  The Policy Councils themselves approve their final products, not KCPI. This keeps the final decisions in the hands of those who have been exposed to the highest number of perspectives, and who have done the greatest amount of analysis of the issue. At the same time, KCPI remains fully informed about the progress of the Policy Councils because there is always at least one KCPI Board member (usually several) participating in all of the Policy Councils.Challenges and LimitationsOne of the biggest challenges for Policy Councils is managing time. Policy Councils are lengthy processes, and it can be a challenge to keep volunteers committed. Keeping everyone on task is vital, and it is important that Council members understand that the work they are doing – both in and outside of meetings – needs to be completed by a certain time. Having a committed, talented staff in place to support the Council’s work is also very important.  Although Policy Council members are volunteering their time and energy in order to foster policy change, the basic function of a Council is to come up with informed options for change. It is the hope of KCPI and the Policy Councils that action will take place based on their findings, but the Councils do not have a method for making sure their efforts translate into action. Not being officially linked to any government agency means that there is no guarantee that a Policy Council’s findings will be taken into consideration by policymakers. This is clearly a challenge, because people have a need to know that their efforts are making a difference.  Although KCPI is equipped with the ongoing infrastructure and expertise needed for establishing new Councils, establishing new Councils each time is also a challenge, and may be the reason so few issues have been tackled by KCPI’s Policy Councils. Publicizing the opportunity to serve on Policy Councils, recruiting the necessary stakeholders, decision makers and community leaders, ensuring that the various regions of the state are represented and handling the logistics required in getting these large groups together are all difficult, time consuming and resource intensive tasks. If the initial group is not effective, the process needs to be started again from the beginning. For the health care issue, four or five different large Policy Councils were convened before one was successful in working together.  Another challenge for the Policy Councils is funding. KCPI is a nonprofit organization with a small staff, and seeking funds is an ongoing task. Having funders committed to the organization or to the Policy Councils from the start would help ensure that when a Council needs to be established, it can be. KCPI has found that it is also important to ensure that some of the Board members are committed to helping the organization succeed by helping to secure funding.Secondary Sources  Interviews conducted by Sandy Heierbacher with Jennifer Bobbitt, KCPI Executive Director, Dr. Phillip Laemmle, KCPI Board member and current Judicial Review Policy Council member, and Mr. Sheryl Snyder, former Chair of KCPI Board and current Judicial Review Policy Council member.

In addition to new internal structures (environmental justice Policy Working Groups and Coordinators Councils, for example), the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council (NEJAC) was established to allow community, industry and state/local government groups to come together to ‘reinvent’ solutions to environmental justice problems. NEJAC also provides a valuable forum for integrating environmental justice with other EPA priorities and initiatives. Established by charter on September 30, 1993, NEJAC provides independent advice, consultation and recommendations to the Administrator of the U.S. EPA on matters related to environmental justice.  “Environmental justice” is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people, regardless of race, color, national origin or income, with respect to the development, implementation and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations and policies. Environmental justice is achieved when everyone, regardless of race, culture or income, enjoys the same degree of protection from environmental and health hazards and equal access to decision-making that effects the environment in which they live, learn and work.  The Office of Environmental Justice and NEJAC provide the mechanism and financial support that make it possible for those concerned about environmental justice issues to meet on a regular basis, design research programs, present their concerns directly to the federal administration, hold public meetings at which groups and individuals can testify, and discuss federal programs that are relevant to environmental inequities.  History  NEJAC was created under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) of 1972. Since it is chartered as a discretionary council (not a statutory council), NEJAC must be re-chartered every other year, arguing again and again that the expert advice obtained through NEJAC cannot be obtained from within the EPA itself.Organizational Structure, Funding and Participant Selection  NEJAC is made up of 25 members and one Designated Federal Official (DFO), who serve on a parent council (the Executive Council or Council) that has seven Subcommittees. Members are selected from among community-based groups (4 members); academic and educational institutions (4); State and local governments (3); industry and business (3); Federally recognized Tribes and Indigenous groups (3); and non-governmental (4) and environmental groups (4) as deemed appropriate.  As for any discretionary FACA program, the government official who requests the program serves as the Administrator of the program. That Administrator selects the DFO, who will directly oversee the Executive Council and serve as a conduit to the Administrator for recommendations from NEJAC.  Along with the NEJAC Executive Council members who fill Subcommittee posts, an additional 39 individuals serve on the various Subcommittees. The Subcommittees are Air &amp; Water, Enforcement, Health &amp; Research, Indigenous Peoples, International and Waste/Facility Siting, and they are each sponsored by a program office (the Enforcement Subcommittee is sponsored by the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, for example). In addition to these six Subcommittees, NEJAC has established a Protocol Committee which consists of the chair of NEJAC and the chairs of each Subcommittee.  Subcommittees usually consist of nine or ten members, although one currently includes 16 members. Generally, three members of the Executive Council serve on each Subcommittee. Members of the Executive Council selected by the Council’s DFO serve as the DFOs of the Subcommittees, chairing the Subcommittees and reporting their findings to the Executive Council. The Executive Council determines whether the recommendations will be communicated to the EPA Administrator.  In addition to the Subcommittees, the Executive Council may establish workgroups from within Council membership to delve into specific issues which need to be addressed. Subcommittees may also establish smaller workgroups from within their memberships. The workgroups, which are primarily established for brainstorming or investigation purposes, then report back to the larger Subcommittee.  Members are selected for NEJAC based on regional representation, recommendations and level of knowledge in their chosen field. Candidates may nominate themselves or be nominated by others, and a letter of recommendation from someone familiar with the candidate’s experience is encouraged. The Office of Environmental Justice reviews all applications and forwards recommendations to the EPA Administrator, who then makes the appointment. Program offices that support a specific Subcommittee assist in selections for that Subcommittee.  Applications are received frequently, so NEJAC experiences no difficulty finding new members. Current and former members of NEJAC often inspire qualified colleagues to apply, as do EPA staff and representatives of other federal agencies. Announcements about upcoming vacancies are also distributed at the annual conferences, which encourages members of the public who are well-versed in these issues to apply.  Membership is rotated to provide the greatest possible opportunity for a variety of individuals to serve. Each NEJAC appointment begins on January 1 and ends December 31 of the same year, but extensions may be granted for up to 3 years. If a member resigns, a replacement is appointed to complete the term.  The EPA is responsible for the financial and administrative support of NEJAC. Within the EPA, this support is provided by the Office of Environmental Justice, Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. As of 2001, NEJAC’s estimated annual operating cost is $970,970, which supported 15 staff members. The EPA also covers travel and per diem expenses when determined necessary and appropriate.Specializations and Activities  The NEJAC Executive Council convenes by conference call every other week and the Subcommittees meet by conference call once a month. About half of the Subcommittees are able to meet face-to-face on a yearly basis (in addition to the annual meeting), depending on the funding made available to them through their sponsoring program office.  The Subcommittees primarily address issues that are assigned by their sponsoring office. If they are not given a specific issue or task for the coming year, the Subcommittees are often briefed on their division manager’s vision and plans for the year and asked to think about how they might fit into that vision, or they are given an idea of what their role in the next year could be. NEJAC is also free to make recommendations to the program offices about what they and the Subcommittees should be examining.  The Subcommittees’ findings and recommendations are often submitted to the NEJAC Executive Council, which may or may not communicate the recommendations to the EPA Administrator. Subcommittees also make recommendations directly to their sponsoring program offices, and provide informal advice, stakeholder input and other such information to their program offices year-round. Subcommittees cannot make recommendations independently to the EPA.  A recent initiative of the International Subcommittee provides a good example of the kind of work a Subcommittee might take on. The Subcommittee examined the effects of pesticide spraying on cocoa plants in Columbia. After determining that the spraying was harming the local residents and animals, and even doing damage to the crops, the Subcommittee brought their findings to the attention of their sponsoring office, EPA’s Office of International Relations. They requested that decision makers in their sponsoring office attend a meeting with a delegation of representatives from Colombian non-governmental organizations working on the issue, several public health officials and other government officials. The International Subcommittee took a strong stand on this issue and communicated their position to their sponsoring office through advice, letters and requests. Although not a direct result of the Subcommittee’s efforts, a recent Congressional ruling limited fumigation in Columbia.  Members of the Executive Council and Subcommittees and additional federal and state EPA officials all come together annually for large week-long meetings. About 100 people participate in the entire meeting, 50 to 60 of which are EPA staff. In addition, hundreds of members of the public attend the public hearings. These widely-publicized annual meetings are held in a different location in the U.S. each year in order to provide opportunities for different segments of the public to attend.  Public involvement in the annual meetings consists of two evening public comment sessions (three to four hours each), in which 40 to 50 people are typically signed up to speak. Those who speak at the public hearings are free to address any issue related to Environmental Justice, but are encouraged to address the specific issues being dealt with throughout the week. Members of the public (present or not) are also given the opportunity to submit written testimony, and are welcome to attend any of the meetings held throughout the week. In addition, local communities and groups often host dinners, briefings or community tours.  Before the annual meeting, a work group made up of members of the Executive Council develops a report based on the work and recommendations of the Council and Subcommittees. This report is examined and discussed at the annual meeting by all of those present – including the public. The 2002 report focused on pollution prevention and environmental justice; previous reports have focused on such topics as community-based environmental health and fish consumption and water quality.  Final decisions are not made at the annual meeting. NEJAC Executive Council and Subcommittee members, EPA officials and the public are all given 30 additional days after the meeting to examine the preliminary draft of the report, submit additional comments and make final recommendations.  Major Projects and Events  In 1995, NEJAC recommended to EPA that public meetings be held on revitalizing urban areas by introducing new industry in order to create jobs, eliminate the problems of abandoned buildings and help establish sustainable communities. Public dialogues on urban revitalization and Brownfields (abandoned, unused or underutilized properties) were held throughout the country, providing, for the first time, an opportunity for EJ advocates and residents of impacted communities to systematically provide input regarding issues related to the EPA’s Brownfields Economic Redevelopment Initiative. These dialogues had a significant influence on Brownfields policy, and were the impetus behind the EPA’s annual Brownfields Conference.  NEJAC recommended in 1996 that EPA conduct local “roundtable meetings” to serve the many citizens who do not feel as if their voice is heard at the national level. These meetings allow more in-depth discussions of environmental justice issues, and can more effectively address regional issues. Regional roundtables organized as a result of this recommendation have provided the opportunity for more local stakeholders to become involved in EPA issues, and often allow community members to address specific issues of concern with representatives from their state agency or local government.  NEJAC’s first concrete product, the Model Plan for Public Participation, which is used widely by state and local EPAs, was completed in 1996. In 2000, the Indian Tribal Governments Guide was produced, which addresses concerns raised about the lack of effective consultation and collaboration between federal agencies and American Indian and Alaska Native tribal governments.  Publications, Outcomes and Effects  Contractors work with NEJAC year-round in order to effectively compile the recommendations provided in the initial reports which are presented at the annual meeting for review and discussion. The contractors then incorporate into the report the new information that is generated at the annual meeting and during the 30-day period after the meeting, including the public comments and written testimonies gleaned at the meeting and afterward. A new report is then submitted to the NEJAC Executive Council for approval. After it is approved, the report is submitted to the EPA Administrator. NEJAC recently submitted a 200-page report on water pollution and fish consumption to the Administrator.  In addition to this annual report, NEJAC subcommittees may produce white papers (technical documents that examine a problem and propose possible solutions), smaller reports, letters of resolution, recommendations and planning documents. All of these products are advisory in nature, and are submitted to the appropriate program office or to the NEJAC Executive Council, which may forward the recommendations to the EPA Administrator. Generally, subcommittees submit informational papers or letters to their sponsoring program offices two or three times a year.  Analysis and Lessons LearnedStrengthsNEJAC provides the opportunity for ordinary members of the public to contribute to the work of NEJAC and the Office of Environmental Justice, and members of NEJAC treat public opinions with respect. Through participation in the NEJAC Executive Council and its Subcommittees, members of the public can also impact the EPA and its various program offices.  Their relationship with the public is one of NEJAC’s greatest strengths. Members of the public sometimes view NEJAC as their last chance to influence policy relating to important environmental justice issues that affect their lives. Although NEJAC can only recommend changes to the EPA, and cannot effect a change in policy itself, NEJAC is trusted and relied on by members of the public. In addition to giving qualified citizens the opportunity to serve on the Executive Council or Subcommittees, NEJAC provides a variety of needed opportunities for citizens to voice their grievances and concerns to the EPA.  A diversity of viewpoints, background and expertise is ensured in the membership of NEJAC. Members are not required to be experienced in environmental justice issues from the start, so a more representative group of people can be recruited. Since NEJAC is such a large structure, with multiple Subcommittees focused on a specific area of environmental justice, the opportunities to participate are greater than in many other advisory committees. Limiting members’ terms to three years ensures that even more people will have the opportunity to participate.  NEJAC fosters collaboration among the diverse stakeholders in environmental justice issues (including EPA officials). Often various members of a Subcommittee and the officials at the sponsoring office begin tackling a particular issue with very different perspectives and opinions, with little willingness to compromise. After months of working in the Subcommittees on the issue, however, the members and officials who were previously polarized begin to discover common ground on the issue, and to build trust in one another. This results in the beginnings of policy change.  NEJAC members consider themselves to have a lot of influence on the EPA – especially on the program offices that work directly with the Subcommittees. Their influence on policy issues has increased significantly since they began focusing their annual meetings on specific policy issues in 1999. NEJAC has also made headway on integrating the concept and consideration of environmental justice within the EPA.Challenges and LimitationsIt is extremely important that the EPA and the sponsoring program offices are committed to NEJAC and convinced of its importance. One challenge that NEJAC faces is the perspective of some EPA officials that NEJAC is a group of troublemakers who want to hinder the work of the EPA. Because of this notion, some NEJAC Subcommittees currently have no assignments from their sponsoring program offices, and are beginning to break down.  NEJAC is an ambitious attempt to change the culture of an organization, but succeeding at such a change requires participation and buy-in from an entire organization, and this is not easily achievable – even in a small organization. Because the importance of environmental justice (and public participation in EJ issues) is not embraced by many of the EPA staff, NEJAC often does not receive a response when they submit a policy-related recommendation.  One challenge that NEJAC regularly faces, since it needs to be re-chartered every two years, is to gain and retain the respect of Congress and the federal government. Every other year, the EPA needs to prove that the advice and recommendations that they glean from the public through NEJAC are valuable and sound, and that they could not be obtained from within the agency itself. Because of this circumstance, the EPA feels some degree of pressure to place people with certain kinds of clout on the NEJAC Executive Council, and this has the potential to detract from the representativeness of the Council.  The DFO (Designated Federal Official), who has the power to decide when and why the NEJAC Executive Council is convened, is the Director of the Office of Environmental Justice or his designee. This person must be present at all meetings, must set the agenda in advance and may adjourn any meeting when he determines that it is “in the public interest” to do so. Although this level of power does not seem to have caused any problems for NEJAC, there is clearly the potential for a DFO who is uninterested or opposed to NEJAC – or just too busy to dedicate the time – to greatly hinder its existence.  NEJAC’s dependence on the commitment and ability of the primary DFO and the DFOs assigned to each of the Subcommittees is a major challenge, and several of the committees have floundered because of this. The success of a NEJAC Subcommittee depends on having a committed DFO and having committed, able members.Secondary Sources  Interviews conducted by Sandy Heierbacher with Charles Lee, Associate Director of the U.S. EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice and Designated Federal Official (DFO) of NEJAC; Peggy Shepard, NEJAC Chair ; Marva King, NEJAC Program Manager; Michael Slimak, EPA’s Associate Director for Ecology; and Patricia Bonner and Lisa Kahn of the EPA Office of Policy, Economics and Innovation.

This advisory board is responsible for deliberating on key health issues and charged with issuing recommendations for improvements on the matters. Since their establishment in 2002, the Council has issued fourteen reports with suggestions for improving the current health issue. The Council is comprised of thirty members of the public that meet twice a year for three days at a time to discuss and deliberate about an issue that the Council committee has set forth. The resulting reports are then presented to the NICE board and the recommendations are taken into consideration for the implementation of new programs that would help to address the concern.Mission and Purpose  Typically, decisions concerning important national issues are made by politicians or experts in their field. While some countries still prefer this type of leadership, the United Kingdom has decided to include the public that they serve in their decision-making processes. The National Health Service and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has created an independent Citizen's Council that deliberates over important and imminent health issues facing NICE. The unique thing about this Citizen's Council is that it is entirely comprised of member of the public representing England and Wales. The hope behind this Council is that by having a representative sample of the public deliberating over key health issues, that the support for new health programs and initiatives would be much greater from ordinary UK citizens because they now have the comfort of knowing that their voices are being heard and listened to. This council is also responsible for evaluating the social and moral issues that are raised by NICE guidelines. ""The Citizen's Council was established to ensure that the views of those who fund the NHS- the public- are incorporated into the decision-making process."" [1]History  The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence was established in 1999; however its Citizen's Council was not established until 2002. While the council is responsible for presenting its findings to the NICE board, it is still considered an independent committee that is centered on public involvement. The committee has thirty members at any one time and each member serves a three year term. The board meets twice a year for three days at a time in order to hear opinions and deliberate on possible solutions for their current health topic. Through NICE's values of transparency, collaboration and stakeholder involvement they have been able to establish this Citizen's Council with the support and funding of the public that they serve.Organizational Structure and Participant Selection  This council was established in order to allow the public more active participation in the decisions and implementations of programs concerning their health. NICE and the NHS believe that public involvement is a key part in gaining public support and trust while providing excellent health services that serve England and Wales. The public's participation gives the NHS and NICE a more well-rounded look at the health issues they are currently facing and this in turn allows them to make better, more well-informed decisions concerning possible solutions. The council itself is a representative sample of the population in England and Wales. This is to say that no portion or subset of the population that this committee serves is left out of the decision-making process. This is also one of the best possible ways to ensure fairness and equality in the deliberative process. There are thirty members on the council at any one time and each member has a term of three years.Deliberations and Decisions  To begin the process of deliberation, the council committee and the NICE board decide collaboratively, what the council should discuss in the upcoming session. When the council meets they listen to different views on the current topic then outline and present their conclusions to the NICE board. The NICE board then issues a formal response with their reactions to the councils' suggestions as well as any action that is going to be taken as a result of those suggestions. The recommendations and conclusions of the council have been incorporated into a document called the Social Value Judgments ""which describes the principles that NICE and its advisory bodies should use when making decisions about the clinical and cost effectiveness of intervention.""[ [2] ] During the listening phase of the councils' meeting, the members hear from expert witnesses in the fields concerning the current topic under debate. The council then proceeds to have small group discussions and may question the witnesses at the end of day three. Since 2002 the council has issued fourteen reports to the NICE board. The topics that are deliberated over range from health inequalities to patient safety and the while there may have been suggestions set forth by NICE, the result of the council often gives a solution that had not been previously thought of by NICE which is exactly why the council is there. At the conclusion of the gathering, the council votes on the desired conclusion that is to be presented to the board and the majority wins.Publications, Outcomes and Effects  Incentives, smoking and harm reduction, innovation, departing from the threshold, quality adjusted life years and severity of illness, patient safety, ""only in research"", health inequalities, rule of rescue, mandatory public health measures, ultra orphan drugs, confidential inquiries, age, and clinical need are the titles and topics that the council has deliberated over since their birth in 2002. While their titles don't always give away what they were discussing, these reports have been very helpful and insightful for NICE to get a good idea of how the public would go about solving an issue. For example ""in the health inequalities report, the council [was] asked to debate whether NICE should focus on improving the health of the majority of the population, thus increasing the gap between socio-economic groups, or whether they should focus instead on the poor health of minority groups. After listening to the views and assessing all the evidence, the [council] decided that health care should go to those whose needs are greatest, irrespective of their socio-economic group.""[ [3] ] In the instances of some of the other meetings, the council often voted on and came to conclusions that had not otherwise been considered by the NICE board. The council seems to be very effective at specifying their concerns with certain aspects of a proposition such as incentives while taking into account all of the possible solutions. By presenting their findings to the NICE board, the Citizen's Council has helped to implement a number of guidelines and programs that aim to improve the overall health and well being of the citizen's of the United Kingdom. The NICE website has more information about the meeting procedures and findings of each topic in detail and follow from most recent to oldest as listed below:Citizens Council report: incentives  Citizens Council report: smoking and harm reduction  Citizens Council report: innovation  Citizens Council report: departing from the threshold  Citizens Council report: quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and severity of illness  Citizens Council report: patient safety  Citizens Council report: ""only in research""  Citizens Council report: health inequalities  Citizens Council report: rule of rescue  Citizens Council report: mandatory public health measures  Citizens Council report: ultra orphan drugs  Citizens Council report: confidential inquiries  Citizens Council report: age  Citizens Council report: clinical needAnalysis and Criticisms  Although NICE had the great idea to include members of the public in important and influential decision-making processes, there is still some room for improvement to the current set-up. While it is generally agreed upon that public opinion has added a beneficial dimension to the decision-making processes about public health, it is a little puzzling that the topics over which the council deliberates is not under the power of the council. In other words, the council committee, which is made up of professionals, along with the rest of NICE, are the ones who decide what topic they would like the council's opinion on. So while the NHS and NICE think that public opinion on health issues is important, they delegate what topics they want the opinions on. This could be hiding some health concerns that the public would like to see resolved before dealing with others but they don't have the freedom to decide the priority of the topics on which they discuss.  In the description of each meeting, there is a detailed outline of how the three-day meetings operate and end. The expectations and goals of each day were well laid out for the council members. A number of experts are brought in to speak on different sides about the topic and the council breaks in to small groups at multiple times to discuss the testimonies and vote on possible solutions. The flaw in only relying on expert witnesses is that their information does not always paint the best overarching picture. Due to the fact that some sources refused to give certain information, the basis of knowledge on which the council members are supposed to deliberate is limited and somewhat skewed. The council does demonstrate efficiency in prioritizing their key values as well as identifying a broad range of solutions, weighing the pros and cons and making the best decision possible with regard to the topic at hand. This council has not demonstrated any haste or rash decisions and rarely do they vote a blanket ""yes"" on important issues without adding some caveats that help to specify their stance.  Overall the Citizen's Council does a great job at discussing the topic that the Council committee and NICE board has set out for them and their meetings result in a well thought out and versatile range of analyzed solutions. The down side of being a Citizen's Council is that once the presentation of findings has been made to the board, there is not much else the members can do in order to implement the suggestions they have made. It is not out of their hands and on to the next topic.References  ""Citizen's Council."" National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. National Health Service, 31 March 2010.

The mission is to bring together post-secondary students with local practitioners to work on experimental art and media projects aimed at engaging the public in local social and political issues.  Drawing on methdologies associated with  social innovation labs , the Creative Publics Lab conducts 'civic experiments' in collaboration with post-secondary instititutions.  Origins and Development  Creative Publics Lab (CPL) grew out of the PhD research of Tara Mahoney, a student in the School of Communication at Simon Fraser University (SFU) and the creative director of local non-profit,  Gen Why Media . Gen Why Media uses art, media and public events to engage young people in social and political issues. Creative Publics Lab builds on the work of Gen Why Media and brings it together with SFU School of Communication, which has a long history of supporting and facilitating grassroots political engagement through projects such as the Media Democracy Project. The idea for the Creative Publics Lab arose out of a need expressed by students within the School of Communication at Simon Fraser University for tangible opportunities to use their communication knowledge and capabilities to promote social justice and political engagement.  The International Centre of Art for Social Change played a key role in the founding of the lab by providing support for the first experiment in the Fall of 2015 which set the groundwork for subsequent projects. The CPL has since worked with several community groups, art collectives and social enterprises including the  Tin Can Studio , Woodshop Worker’s Cooperative,  Apathy is Boring , and Woodward’s Community Singers who have helped shape the direction of the CRL through their feedback and participation. Through research and iteration, the student participants have also provided key input into the development of the lab.  Over the past decade, social innovation labs or ‘social labs’ have grown in global popularity across post-secondary institutions, government and social sector organizations as a way to invent, adopt or adapt new ideas through interdisciplinary collaboration.[1] Creative Publics Lab is an effort to stimulate and test new ideas for how student can better engage with local political issues through their course work. By teaching students how to use communication theories, methods, and practices to intervene in local issues, the CPL aims to go beyond raising students’ awareness and show them how art and media can be used to intervene and take action in strategic and creative ways. While Creative Publics Lab is the first lab at SFU focused on participatory politics, there are other efforts within SFU to use the social lab model as a way to engage students in the areas of local economic development (LED Lab), urban planning (City Studio) and environmental sustainability (Change Lab). Rationale for the Creative Publics Lab emerged from the research of PhD student Tara Mahoney and her analysis of emerging forms of participatory politics. Despite spending more time in postsecondary institutions than any generation before and being the most educated generation of all time,[2] students leave post-secondary programs without learning basic skills for applied political communication. This is the case despite younger generations facing a political environment of mounting debt, diminished job security, increasing costs of food, tuition and housing, and a convergence of challenges caused by the threats of climate change and intensifying income inequality. In the face of these collective challenges, digital civic literacy, community organizing, and political communication competencies have never been more important as is the need to support new forms civic engagement.  Since the late 1980s, engagement with traditional political institutions in Canada has seen drastic declines across the population and particularly among young people. Many commentators have chronicled this widespread civic disengagement, whether measured through participation in community affairs, political party membership, voter turnout, trust in institutions or people, the quality of public discourse, or attention to or knowledge of public affairs.[3][4][5][6] As a result of the erosion of democratic institutions, the increasing decline in the support for establishment politics and a growing sense of powerlessness among citizens, political engagement is in a process of transformation. ‘Being political’ has expanded to include a vast range of ‘participatory’ socio-political behavior associated with digital forms of political expression and organizing.  As younger generations are retreating from established political institutions and processes, new forms of political engagement are emerging that work largely outside formal political institutions and manifest as practices of self-organization, networked communication, ‘do-it-ourselves’ maker culture, and short-term conditional affiliation. “Participatory politics” is an overarching concept that encompasses these emerging currents of political engagement and is defined as “interactive, peer-based acts through which individuals and groups seek to exert both voice and influence on issues of public concern”.[7] The contemporary usage of term is rooted in theories of participatory culture [8] that emphasize contemporary and historic efforts by grassroots communities to exert greater control over the means of media production and circulation, including amateur publishing movements in the nineteenth century, the grassroots radio movement of the early twentieth century, and various forms of underground press and radio efforts in the 1960s.[9]  Nowadays political participation not only describes voting in elections, writing a letter to the editor, going to  town hall discussions , or becoming a member of a political party. Instead, activities such as making a video, sharing media, starting an organization, signing a  petition , circulating news, building an app, joining a political group online,  crowd-sourcing  policy, and organizing a community event are increasingly how publics are exerting political agency. Expressions of participatory politics can be seen in the growth and influence of ""netroots"" political associations [10] and networked social movements [11], both of which have gained prominence in the past decade and play an increasing role in citizen participation. Participatory politics can also be observed in the economic sphere, where there are substantial efforts to ‘democratize the economy’ through peer-to-peer infrastructures that are gradually becoming the general conditions of work, economy, and society.[12] The common theme joining these efforts are the deployment novel tactical repertoires and organizational strategies that utilize the affordances of the new media environment.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The International Centre of Art for Social Change provided support for the first experiment of the lab in the Fall of 2015 which set the groundwork for subsequent projects. The CPL has since worked with several community groups, art collectives, and social enterprises, including the Tin Can Studio, Woodshop Worker’s Cooperative,  Apathy is Boring , and Woodward’s Community Singers who have helped shape the direction of the CRL through their participation. Through research and iteration, the student participants have also provided key input into the development of the lab. Seed funding for the first two experiments of the Creative Publics Lab were paid for through student engagement and research grants within Simon Fraser University. The organizers designed the engagement methods iteratively, in response to course themes, student consultation, and the needs of the community partners.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Creative Publics Labs is a  social innovation lab  specializing in civic experiments: small-scale projects that use cultural and media production to test how theoretical ideas can be applied in the real world. Interventions are designed to open up new areas of inquiry and find new ways to engage the public issues of common concern.  Each of the lab civic experiments is designed to achieve the following objectives:Capacity Building: Facilitate  civic literacy  and professional development of post-secondary students through collaborative relationships with community organizations. Through  community-based learning models , the lab connects students with the social sector in order to build capacities in project management, digital storytelling, public art interventions, issue framing, event planning, media relations, and  citizen journalism .Community Engagement : Re-imagine the student course work as a way to practice dialogue,  community organizing , and cultural production through working on local political and social campaigns.  Research: Provide a space for research into the connection between the theories of civic media and the practice media-based community organizing.The Lab's experiments use a wide variety of participatory methods and tools including but not limited to:Public Policy CollagePop-up DemocracyPhotovoiceMicro-UtopiasParticipatory artsCitizen journalismActivities within the Lab:Within the lab, participation is iterative and looks different depending on the nature of project or activity. For example, in the case of the  public policy collage  experiment, participation involved people making collages, singing, and drawing in a public space. In the case of the  photovoice  experiment, participation looked like students interviewing and photographing local community organizers, writing compelling short stories, and mounting a public art display in the lobby of the university showcasing the profiles. In the case of planning micro-utopias, it looked like students using art-based facilitation technique to imagine alternative societal futures.Post-experiment Participation and Action:The lab experiments culminate in some type of public action, which can take the form of an event, appearance in the media, an exhibit, an intervention in public space, and so on. This allows for the work of the participants to be showcased in a public forum, diversifying the kinds of voices present in public discourse. For instance, in the case of the public policy collage, the collages and drawings were displayed in prominent public spaces in the weeks leading up to the federal election and the project was covered by several local and regional media outlets.  While the experiments conducted within CPL have yet to directly address decision-makers, they have sought to operate as a model for how creativity and art-making can be used to engage publics in politics. The participatory arts approach of the CPL creates the conditions for dialogue amongst diverse publics through art-based activities rather than verbal discourse. This approach makes it accessible to a diverse community who did not need to have extensive knowledge of politics in order to participate. It has allowed for listening through quiet one-on-one conversations about issues that mattered to the participants and were being expressed through the art. The act of physically making art also acts as a social lubricant, allowing people to focus on working with their hands which takes some of the intimidation out of talking about politics with a stranger.Civic Experimentation and Participatory Research:Civic experiments are a form of  participatory research  in that they attempt to solve a problem — creating effective forms of participatory innovation — through engagement with affected parties. There are three types of participants in the Creative Publics Lab: students, community partners, and the public. The students are recruited in the same way they are recruited for courses — through university communication and standard course-selection procedures. The lab focuses on students because educated people in their 20s and 30s are often early adopters of new forms of  communication technology , which put them in a unique position to take advantage of participatory politics. Community partners are recruited based on the degree to which they address key issues that have been identified as priorities for the lab. Ideally, the Lab's partners are organizations that are both innovating in the area of participatory politics and need help with engaging citizens, mobilizing public opinion, and influencing decision-making. The public is recruited through online and face-to-face projects designed and executed by the students in collaboration with community partners.  Experimenting with a variety of methods and tools has positive outcomes for participants (capacity building), and provides qualitative and quantitative data on the efficacy of the techniques for researchers and practitioners. Field notes, interviews, and written reflections from participants provide evidence that activities have created meaningful opportunities for experiential political learning and community dialogue. For instance, the interview and survey data from an experiment using public policy collage demonstrated that the method increased the motivation of participants to vote in the election, positively interrupted the patterns of everyday life, and created a political space where participants could quietly reflect on their complex feelings around election issues.  In another lab experiment using the photovoice method, pre and post  survey  results with students indicated that the community engagement aspect of their projects enhanced students’ ability to communicate about social issues in a real world setting and helped them to see how the course subject matter can be used in everyday life. The majority of students who participated also expressed how the project helped them become more aware of the needs in their community and the interactions with the community partner enhanced their learning in the course.  Major Projects and EventsArt-making and the federal election (Fall 2014)This experiment was conducted outside a course and was part of a research initiative which brought together artists, students and community members to participate in art-making inspired by social and political issues leading up to the federal election in October 2015. In collaboration with mobile art studio Tin Can Studio, CPL traveled to four sites and set up interventions where participants had the opportunity to explore election issues through various forms of art-making including collage, photography, videography, chalk art and improvised choir.Participatory Youth Media Cultures Course (Fall 2016)This lab experiment was conducted in conjunction with Communications 427: Participatory Youth Media Cultures, an advanced lecture/seminar examining the development of contemporary youth media cultures. Creative Publics Lab partnered with national community engagement organization,  Apathy is Boring , to facilitate the production of photovoice projects that document how young people are working together towards progress on local political and social issues. Student projects contributed to the 150 Years Young: a signature initiative of the Canada 150 celebrations, which aims to showcase the diverse, conventional, and unconventional ways young people are building more resilient communities across Canada.Seeing Power: Art and Micro-utopias (Spring 2017)This lab experiment was conducted in conjunction with Education 837, a graduate seminar examining the relationships between contemporary media cultures, aesthetics, and politics. Creative Publics Lab assisted in the development of projects that explores the concept of utopia. Through a series of  workshops , student developed project proposals for speculative micro-utopias – imaginary public spaces and interactions that gesture toward a desired future. Students were encouraged to critically reflect on the current socio-political issues that concern them, chose a theme to focus on and imagine solutions that are unrestrained by time, money, and expertise. Then, with support from the instructors and local practitioners, students engaged in a process of ‘pragmatic utopianism’ – figuring out how they might make their dream projects into reality. Among others, student projects included a pop-up community centre, a summer camp for mental health professionals, an immersive video projection installation, and an intergenerational, intercultural storytelling initiative.Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

This Act initiated a wholesale restructuring of the health provision system. Several agencies, such as the Health and Social Services Councils and Mental Health Commission, were dissolved. Other organisations were renamed: the Health and Social Services trusts, for instance, became the Health and Social Care trusts. Finally, new organisations were set up in the policy area of health and social care, among these the ‘health and social care bodies’, one of which is the Patient and Client Council. Thus the Patient and Client Council was established as part of a broader programme to improve health and social care provision in Northern Ireland. In 2012, the PCC released a report of all its major findings over the three years. It continues to operate to date.  History  The Northern Ireland Executive launched a review of public administration (RPA) in 2002 in order to assess the arrangements for accountability, development, and delivery of all public services. The result of that review was a radical and complex overhaul of the entire structure of public administration, particularly in the areas of Education, Health, and Local Government.  The Patient and Client Council (PCC) was established in April 2009 as part of a drive to modernise the provision of health and social care in Northern Ireland. A 2005 report titled ‘A Healthier Future’ outlines many of the problems Northern Ireland was facing prior to the modernisation efforts, particularly when compared to other countries in the United Kingdom. These problems were described in the report as ‘neither acceptable nor sustainable’ but had multiple sources, and thus required wholesale change in the health and social care system.  At the time, it was recognised that Northern Ireland had a had the highest rate of deaths from heart disease in Europe. Cancer survival rates were only median among European countries. Furthermore, smoking constituted the single biggest cause of premature deaths and avoidable illnesses in Northern Ireland, claiming £22 million in related healthcare costs. Similarly, 750 people were dying prematurely every year due to alcohol. The direct impact on government was estimated at £34 million a year in losses due to hospital care and alcohol-related crimes. Aside from this, rising levels of obesity and lower rates of physical activity among the people of Northern Ireland were also predicted to create greater burdens on the healthcare system.  Demographic changes were among some of the big concerns. The report predicted that the next 20 years would see an increase in demand for health and social care. The population was expected to grow from just over 1.7 million to just over 1.8 million in 2024. However, while there were 118,000 more children aged under 16 than people of pensionable age in 2003, by 2026 this trend would reverse. The average age in Northern Ireland was predicted to rise from 36.8 years to 41.3 years. Importantly, while a younger population than the UK average would suggest that Northern Ireland would have fewer health and social care needs, this was offset by higher levels of deprivation, higher levels of physical and psychological morbidity, and higher levels of disability.  Another important consideration was that there was a worrying level of inequality in healthcare provision. Citizens with poorer socio-economic backgrounds tended to have less access to care facilities, seek help at later stages of disease development, and showed a lower level of demand for professionals. At the same time, people in these groups were more likely to smoke, experience social exclusion and depression, and had higher rates of teenage pregnancy. At particular risk of exclusion were people with disabilities, carers, some children and young people, travellers and people from Black and minority ethnic groups, people with mental health problems, asylum seekers and refugees, people with alcohol and drug dependency, LGBT, older people, homeless people, and victims. The concern was that if the government did not engage with the public and address these issues, ‘the result may be a system which is increasingly unresponsive, unable to meet its obligations under equality and human rights legislation, skewed towards the needs of those who “shout the loudest” and are most articulate, and for which it is not possible to plan over the longer term’.  In response to this, the report set out a 20-year strategy to improve Northern Ireland’s health, social care, and public safety with particular emphasis on responsive provision, equality between different social groups, and public involvement in decision-making. Part of the grand strategy was to involve the public more directly. It was noted that communities were not prepared to accept decisions affecting their lives without question and that citizens felt better about their care when they felt their concerns had been listened to. In particular, there was less risk of inappropriate treatment and individuals were more likely to complete programmes of treatment if there was a sense of ownership. The PCC directly tackles the issue of involving the public and creating a people-centred service of care. Its stated purpose is to ‘provide a powerful, independent voice for patients, clients, carers, and communities on health and social care issues’.  Origanizational Structure and Funding  The PCC was established by the Northern Ireland Assembly, a devolved body of the United Kingdom that governs the autonomous region of Northern Ireland. However, the PCC is directly accountable to the Assembly’s Department for Health, Social Services &amp; Public Safety. As a publicly funded organisation, its budget is derived from the government.Participant SelectionThe PCC recognises that its constituents are diverse and thus using one means of selecting participants will necessarily mean excluding certain groups. For instance, while the internet is used to conduct surveys and recruit citizens, 40% of the constituents do not have access to a computer and thus non-computer based methods are also utilised. The PCC recognises that people are more likely to respond when asked in personal rather than impersonal ways. Thus, newspaper advertisements and distribution of newsletters are not utilised for recruitment. Rather, people are asked directly during face-to-face contact or via letters.  The PCC membership scheme is one key way in which recruitment happens. This is open to all residents of Northern Ireland. Individuals initially sign up online via the PCC website with a username and password. They are then given an opportunity to set their preferred method of communication to post, email or telephone. Members opt in as participants for each of the PCC projects and are contacted via their preferred method of communication. Local Advisory Committees (LACs) are another means for citizens to get involved in the activities of the PCC. Each of the five areas of Northern Ireland (Northern, Southern, Belfast, South Eastern, Western) has a dedicated LAC, which is composed of 8 people from that locality and chaired by one PCC official. LACs advise the PCC on local issues and opinions. Positions on Local Advisory Committees (LAC) are advertised and require citizens to apply by filling out a form that states their desire and suitability for the position. It is a volunteer position, although expenses are paid by the PCC.  Between 2009 and 2012, the PCC engaged over 13000 members of the public to discover their views, experiences, and desires of health and social care provision in Northern Ireland.  Specializations and Activities  The PCC engages in numerous projects every year, which utilise different methodologies and deliver results according to their respective research questions. Participants recruited according to the methods outlined in ‘Participant Selection’ engage in focus groups, one-on-one interviews, group interviews, debates and discussions, telephone and online surveys, and street surveys. The following two cases are merely examples of a variety of methods applied by the PCC.  Major Projects and PublicationsReport on the Public Engagement on “Priorities for Action”, 2009  The purpose of this project was to gain an understanding of the people’s priorities for health and social care and advise the Department of Health, Social Services &amp; Public Safety on public attitudes about the setting of targets. The participants for this project were individual clients, service users, and carers. After agreeing to participate in the project, each participant was sent a letter explaining the purpose of the meeting, the questions that would be addressed, the means of their participation and what their role is.  The participants were brought together into groups for open discussion, with each group attended by two PCC staff who guided the proceedings. The meetings were conducted between August and November 2009. Five meetings were held in each of the Health and Social Care Trust areas, and five meetings were held for groups with a special interest or remit in Northern Ireland. Special consideration was made to ensure a balance locally or regionally between men and women, persons of different religious beliefs, racial groups, ages, marital statuses, sexual orientation, political opinion, gender, disability, and those with and without dependents. Altogether 27 meetings were held involving 303 members of the public. Almost everyone who attended the meetings was able to make a contribution to the discussion.  All meetings followed the same general format: a PCC member of staff first delivered a short introduction at the beginning of the event, after which the discussions would proceed for one hour. The discussion centred around three questions:Were you aware of the targets before we met?  Have you noticed any differences in health and social care recently?  If you were the Minister, what would be your top priorities?After the meeting, the PCC staff who attended the meeting wrote a brief report and sent it to the participants to give them the opportunity to confirm that it reflected their contributions and make comments. Staff also informed the participants that they would receive a copy of the full report once it had been published and information on the Department’s response.The People’s Priorities on Future Priorities for Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland, 2010  This report, similar to the 2009 one, aims to gather the people’s opinions on the setting of targets and priorities for the Department. However, the methodology was different.  Overall, 17 street consultations were conducted in which members of the public were approached on a one-to-one basis during public events such as the Ould Lammas Fair. People were also approached in shopping centres and GP surgeries. Besides this, 24 group meetings were held with participants in order to gain more in-depth discussion of the same survey questions and also to give them an opportunity to share their personal experiences. Overall 940 members of the public took part in the project. 579 individuals answered the short questionnaire on the street while 361 people took part in the group discussions. Each individual was asked to suggest three priorities for health and social care, which generated 1700 responses.  The meetings took place in each of the five Health and Social Care Trust areas and involved individuals from the PCC Membership Scheme as well as community groups and representatives of the voluntary sector. As in the previous year, a PCC staff member gave a short introduction on the ‘Priorities for Action’ project before the discussion was held. The three questions in the questionnaire and discussions were:Were you aware of the PFA Targets before we met?  In light of the proposed reductions in funding for health and social care, if you were the Health Minister, what would your top three priorities be in health and social care in 2011 and beyond?  Do you think targets are important to the delivery of health and social care and if so why?Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Every report from the PCC is used as a basis for discussions with decision-makers. For example, the 2009 ‘Report on the Public Engagement on Priorities for Action’ made recommendations about issues such as the application of standards and targets and the need for standards of communication. Some of the recommendations were adopted in the Department’s 2010 ‘Priorities for Action’ document, which sets out the targets for the implementing bodies on health and social services. The reports thus have a direct and continuous relevance to policy.  Notably, in 2012, the PCC reviewed 34 reports that they had produced since 2009 and summarised the results and impact of the consultations with more than 13000 members of the public. The 2012 report makes explicit comparisons to the Department’s own 2011 ‘Transforming Your Care’ report to inform how the official line converges with and diverges from the views of the public. It therefore served as a good way of seeing gaps in planning. The main results were as follows:  The key message of ‘Transforming Your Care’ is that change in health is necessary, not an option, and this is reflected in the views of the citizens, who acknowledge that current practises need to change. ‘Transforming Your Care’ also made 99 recommendations, most of which overlapped with the priorities of the public. For example, the emphasis on integrated care and joined-up approach to urgent care in ‘Transforming Your Care’ resonates with the wishes of the people. The significant overlaps are due to three principles that are shared between the Department and the people: placing the individual at the centre of any model of care, using quality evidence to shape services, and providing the right care in the right place at the right time.  However, there were a couple of major recommendations made in ‘Transforming Your Care’ that would challenge the views of the public. One recommendation was that care should be provided as close to home as possible. While there is some support for this idea, this proposal would still conflict with the concerns most have expressed about the quality of care provided by community care services. Another recommendation that may prove controversial is the aim to reduce the number of major acute hospitals from ten to the range of ‘five to seven’. This might fly in the face of the public’s concern for equal access to quality hospital care regardless of location.  Analysis and Criticism  The PCC engages in several projects every year and employs a variety of methods to uncover the views of the public. However, there has been some concern raised that it may be falling short of its duty to effectively collate and respond to complaints by the public. On 14th may 2013, the Health and Social Care Board led a workshop in which members of the public were invited to speak to officials about their experiences with lodging complaints. 27 members of the public attended and more submitted comments via email and telephone. 21 on of those who attended had attempted to lodge a complaint while 6 had not. The majority said they were unaware of the role of bodies such as the PCC in the complaints procedure. They either did not know that the PCC existed or that it had a duty to support complainants in finding information about complaints, letter-writing, and keeping them abreast of the status of their complaints. It was decided that greater promotion of the support and advocacy bodies like the PCC would be required.

4867,organization,Seattle Neighborhood City Council,https://participedia.net/organization/4867,Description not available.,0,2010-06-03,2017-04-11,159,Msifuen,https://participedia.net/user/159,159,Msifuen,https://participedia.net/user/159,en,,,Seattle,Washington,,United States,47.6062095,-122.3320708,Government,,,,,,,,,,,,,economics, planning,,," Mission and Purpose  The CNC works to increase the political deliberation process among all Seattle residents.The council convenes to discuss an array of issues pertaining to the city’s infrastructure. Those issues involve recommending neighborhood matching fund projects to the Mayor of Seattle, overseeing the budget priority process, and implementing the neighborhood planning and assistance program. In additions to such, they are also in charge of ensuring that the thirteen district councils succeed in their endeavors, mainly rating neighborhood matching fund projects, funneling budget requests, and creating a forum for community issues.History  Most city governments are broken up according to their different purposes, but Seattle City Officials soon recognized the unique capabilities of each of the neighborhoods in their metropolis and chose to monopolize on this by forming the City Neighborhood Council (CNC) in October of 1987 as part of the Neighborhood Planning and Assistance Program. This was instigated after the passage of Resolution 27709 and came about after several studies concerning city planning reform made their way to Mayor Charles Royer’s desk between the years of 1985 and 1986. The major changes to city planning involved an increase in community service centers from nine to twelve, something that was changed furthermore in later years with the addition of one more district, and the implementation of their subsequent councils. In order to relay information to city officials in a more efficient manner, they created the CNC and required that the group be compiled of one representative from each of the different district councils. What that has eventually lead to is the formation of thirteen distinct city halls and unique forums that help residents engage with officials about local politics on a firsthand basis. Since its enactment, the council has made tremendous strides with several programs including the Seattle Neighborhood Planning Program. With nearly 12,000 volunteers on board since its creation in 1995, the group has assisted the city with issues like affordable housing and traffic relating to the use of automobiles.Organizational Structure and Funding  This unique approach to city governance was created in 1987 by then City Officials. Essentially they created the CNC and its components under Resolution 27709. At the bottom of the formation are the contributions of numerous city organizations, namely non-profits and community councils. Following are the thirteen distinct councils that rate the neighborhood matching fund projects, funnel for budget requests, and develop forums for community issues. Next is the City Neighborhood Council. This group is made up of representatives from each of the numerous district councils and, all together, these units create the Department of Neighborhoods in Seattle. All of the members and committee officers are citizens of Seattle who have been voted into their positions through elections. As far as participating in the monthly forums, anyone from the city is welcome to attend and take part in the deliberative process. In order to verify your appropriate meeting location you should check the current calendar of District Council and CNC meetings on the Department’s website.  Specializations and Activities  The Seattle City Neighborhood Council was created to oversee the successful synchronization of the Neighborhood Matching Fund, Neighborhood Budget Prioritization, and Neighborhood Planning programs. The CNC also coordinates monthly public forums so ordinary citizens can voice their opinions on matters pertaining to city policy. The intent is for the public to air any grievances or concerns so that the CNC can most wisely structure the Neighborhood Planning and Assistance Program.The Learning PhaseReformulating the manner in which the city’s government operated in 1987 while simultaneously working to empower its citizens to become a part of the political process seemed daunting at first, but one of the benefits of Seattle’s neighborhoods is that they had already established a sense of community long before the formation of the Department of Neighborhoods. It’s because of this ambiance that City Officials were confidant in the success of such a change in infrastructure. Initial concerns revolved around the willingness of people to get involved in the deliberative process and whether or not there would be enough public interest in features like the forums to enact some sort of real change.The Deliberation PhaseThe deliberative process is most exemplified during the public forums that are held on a monthly basis. There are separate meeting dates for the CNC and the District Councils, each of which can be attended by any member of the public. Typically citizens meet in places like coffee shops, libraries, or community centers, but it is not unusual for some of the meetings to be held at private dwellings. The process involves the introduction of an issue by one of the council leaders followed by a brief progress report from a committee head. Once they have explained the issue’s status, the public is welcome to make inquiries, suggestions, or feedback of any sort. While the idea is for community members to attend the forums in person, there are a plethora of ways in which someone can receive information about a missed meeting. For instance, the CNC website provides meeting minutes, video footage, and contact information for anyone who is interested in contacting their representative.Major Projects and Events  Since its creation in the late 1980’s, the group has gained enough volunteers to orchestrate over 2,000 community projects, most of which are related to parks and community facilities. There has also been a substantial amount of effort for ventures having to do with public space restoration and library maintenance.Analysis and Criticism  The outcome has been highly successful. Not only have the CNC and its various counterparts fostered more political deliberation among local citizens, but they have also demonstrated that the existence of such a process can turn out to be triumphant.  The overall program has its merits and many would agree that its members work in both a cohesive and efficient manner. After all, its success throughout the years says enough about the program’s potential to prosper for very long time. I will point out that the CNC and its counterparts are not without some flaws. The biggest one is less of a CNC problem and more of a deliberative process issue. The reason why something like the CNC works so well it because of two reasons. Firstly, Seattle already had distinct neighborhoods intact before the creation of anything pertaining to a council, each of which held a diverse sense of community. It was because of this unique formation that officials even considered the implementation of city councils like these. Additionally, Seattle’s residents have always been world-renowned activists, particularly in issues concerning their own city. Thus, the general success of the program relies on the fact that people in Seattle are passionate about community reform and they will gladly volunteer their time at a public forum if need be. This fundamental need to participate in community activism is something that does not necessarily overcome residents of other cities in the manner that is does to the people of Seattle. So, while I highly praise the CNC for all of its hard work and willingness to enhance the deliberative process, I would wager that such a program might not fare well in other cities hoping to follow suit. I think that the most effective way to illicit a response from people in other places would be to create online forums in additions to the ones conducted in person.Secondary Sources  Diers, Jim.

Through collective action, residents have been able to obtain recognition of Yungay as a national heritage site, gaining national and international attention in their struggle for creating a participatory culture among residents in order to be able to determine the future of their neighbourhood with the administration, and not just being subject to its decisions.  Origins and Development  Barrio Yungay is one of Santiago's oldest and biggest neighbourhoods, located in the western part of the city. In 1839, General Manuel Bulnes defeated the Peruvian-Bolivian forces in the small village of Yungay. In the same year, President Joaquín Prieto decided to make Yungay a neighbourhood in Santiago and encouraged settlers to move into and develop the area.  In the 1990s, the neighbourhood was remodelled after being declared a Zone of Urban Renovation (Zona de Renovación Urbana). The municipality of Santiago tried to stimulate the repopulation of the neighbourhood through subsidies. Within this initiative, parks were improved, children's playgrounds built, and cultural activities such as theatric plays, exhibitions and workshops were held in the main square  iv . However, the new buildings constructed clashed with the older existing buildings in terms of size, style, and materials, heterogenising what was once an architecturally homogeneous area. In 2005 the municipality of Santiago altered their trash collection system to disastrous effects in Yungay. Residents gathered in assemblies and designed proposals for alternative trash collection possibilities.  Neighbours questioned the impact of high-rise buildings in their quality of life. The group  Vecinos por la Defensa del Barrio Yungay  (Residents in Defence of Yungay Neighbourhood) was formed in 2006 as an organized opposition to the municipality's modification project in the name of the historic and cultural heritage within the neighbourhood  vii . They demanded the right to participate in deciding the future of their neighbourhood and to participate in the decision-making process in subjects that directly affected them.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The organization does not receive municipal funding; it must solicit private organizations for the funding of individual projects. For instance, RIDYN sought the Fund for the Development of Regional, Provincial and Communal Social Media granted by the Ministerio Secretaria General de Gobierno de Chile, as well as the National Book Foundation in order to publish some issues of their Bello Barrio Magazines.  The organisation also sought Fondart (La Fundación para el Desarollo de Artesanías – The Foundation for the Development of Craftwork) for the development of the Heritage Study necessary for presenting their bid in order to become a National Heritage Site.  RIDYN worked together with the Fermín Vivaceta School in order to restore Yungay after the 2010 earthquake. To offset this effort’s lack of funds, the school charged $40,000 CLP to enrol in the 5-day course, and asked that residents provided their own materials. Later, these same workshops were (and still are) offered free of charge  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Since its inception, the group has held weekly meetings in which different commissions work on themes. These meetings are horizontal and open to anyone who wants to participate and work is carried on on a voluntary basis. Each member can choose a commission to work in depending on his or her interests and for as long as they wish to. Continued participation is guaranteed only by the sense of accomplishment neighbours develop as they see the fruit of their efforts materialise, that is, being able to actively contribute to changing the neighbourhood into a better place, not just waiting for the Municipality to come up with a solution and apply it  viii .  After the unveiling of the modification plan neighbours started weekly meetings in order to discuss the modification project and its effects in the neighbourhood. In the first meeting, only six residents appeared. In the coming weeks, the word was spread around the neighbourhood about their existence and more people showed up. Attendees were not only residents of Yungay, but also former residents and the general public interested in its preservation  ix : youths, artists, professionals, cultural managers, migrants and older adults are always present  x . Within these meetings, strategic action lines have concentrated on the following themes:The legal protection of the neighbourhood through the declaration of national heritage site;  the consolidation of a cultural network in the neighbourhood;  the establishment of a sustainable neighbourhood;  generating exchange opportunities with other neighbourhood;  the creation of a national network of heritage zones;  the creation of subsidies for home owners who live in national heritage sites;  alternative proposals to the modification of Chilean town planning law (Petrowitsch 2012)  xi .According to members of the RIDYN, there are no assigned roles within the group. Each participate voluntarily and contributes with what they can. There is, nonetheless, a core group of 20 active members that are always involved in the activities of the organization  xii . These assemblies prepare the councils and make a pre-selection of the themes that will be there debated.  The weekly assemblies are still being carried out.  Major Projects and Events  Residents in Defence of Yungay Neighbourhood mounted an  effective campaign  against municipal development plans, eventually getting Yungay designated as a National Heritage Site.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Through encouraging resident participation, Vecinos por la Defensa del Barrio Yungay has allowed residents to take a newfound interest in their neighbourhood. Residents now actively participate in rehabilitation efforts, in tourism workshops, and in festival planning. Through these efforts Barrio Yungay is transforming itself from a once abandoned, dilapidated neighbourhood to an energetic, attractive area that draws in outsiders. These changes will hopefully have a positive economic effect on the neighbourhood as property values and tourism rates increase.  The horizontal organisation, the fluidity of participants as well as the lack of a written public protocol of the assemblies and councils makes it difficult to assess the internal working of the organisation and their decision-making practices. Such lack of information can lead one to wonder how much influence general residents truly had in these recent changes in their neighbourhood.  RIDYN faces a series of difficulties such as its inability to attract more residents within Yungay to participate in its assemblies and councils. Because citizen participation is a recent event in Chile, transforming it into a binding force in the various levels of governance instruments within the Chilean government is still a challenge.  As the organization looks to maintaining its future, it needs to establish a written, well-known set of guidelines for the way it is managed. This will ensure two things: 1) that the organization’s momentum and goals will not disappear when its current leaders retire, and 2) that residents’ voices will be guaranteed to be heard in a system of checks-and-balances.

 Registered as Youngstars Development Initiative, it focused on young people between the ages of 18 and 35 with a view to mentor them into becoming high pedigree leaders. The founders believed that this type of leaders to be capable of providing accountable and impactful democratic governance in Nigeria. [1]  Based on the conviction that youths as agent of change have the capacity and energy to demand good governance, the club re-invented the power of young people by focusing on creating awareness about self-actualization, accountability in government, active political participation and development of home-grown democratic innovations. 
 Origins and Development 
 As a non-profit youth-based organization with limited finance, it started operating in 1996 from a barber’s shop in Jos, a city in the Middle Belt area of Plateau State, Nigeria. Kingsley whose parents could not finance his post-secondary education decided to impact his immediate community through political education. A few youths in the city converged once every week to discuss youth-related issues such as national and state politics, music and entertainment, sport updates, relationships and time management in his shop. Over time, the youth club developed into an advocacy group with a vision to steer young Nigerians to their full potentials. [2]  In late 1995 when Kingsley could no longer afford the rent for his barber shop, the weekly meetings collapsed. In order to reach more youths across the country with this message, he extended the activities of the youth club to secondary schools in rural and urban Middle Belt Region of Nigeria through pep-talks on youth-related matters. [3]Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 Funding and support for the Youngstars Foundation is provided by the National Democratic Institute for Public Affairs (NDI), International Republican Institute (IRI), National Endowment for Democracy (NED), USAID and other international donors. 
 Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 Through television programs on the Nigeria National Television Authority (NTA) from 1998 to 2003, Youngstars Foundation was able to form alliances and partnerships with the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), Nigeria Federal Ministry of Youth Development, LYNX Foundation in the US, National Democratic Institute (NDI), USAID, 2Face Foundation, British Council in Nigeria, World Youth Alliance in US, and Office of the Presidency on Millennium Development Goals to mention a few. 
 Major Projects and Events 
 In 2011, the foundation used non-partisan Nigerian celebrities such as Innocent Idibia (2Face), Jude Abaga (M.I), Olubankole Wellington (Banky W) and Oladapo Daniel Oyebanjo (D’banj) as the association’s ambassadors in a USAID-sponsored concert that was organised to educate Nigerian youth on participatory democracy. 
 The National Democratic Institute for International Affairs (NDI) and 2Face Foundation collaborated with Youngstars Foundation in 2015 to mitigate election violence in Nigeria. This was achieved through “Vote Not Fight: Election No Be War”, an internet-based project. [4]  This innovative democratic inclusion project adopted Nigerian popular music artist, 2face Idibia, as its ambassador to pilot voter education towards the 2015 general elections. Several other partnerships and collaborations with other pro-democracy groups in Africa have attracted youths from different sub-Sahara African states including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia and South Africa.

Please help us verify its content.Mission and Purpose 
 Derechos Digitales is a not for profit organization that aims at developing, defending, and promoting human rights through digital technologies that contribute to an egalitarian society. 
 Origins and Development 
 Derechos Digitales was founded in 2005 in Chile by María Paz Canales (current Executive Director) and 13 other members including Alberto Cerda, Daniel Álvarez and Claudio Ruiz as part of a University project. Since then the group has grown into an independent NGO, adding new members, staff, and an internship program. Its work and diverse membership (from Venezuela, Colombia, and Mexico) reflect the organization's aims at having an impact across Latin America. 
 Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 Possibly due to its mostly online presence, the organization's staff is itself quite small. They currently have 14 full-time employees at their head office in Chile. 
 Regional branching out began in 2015. The organization is part of the National Council on Domain Names and IP Numbers, Creative Commons, IFEX (formerly the International Freedom of Expression Exchange), and the Association for Progressive Communications. 
 The organization's funding from 2016 was $443,561 USD ($535,588 in 2015), and comes from international foundations, governmental agency grants, private companies, universities, consulting firms and private donations. A donate button is available on their website and there are plans to hold private donation campaigns but these have not been carried out in the past. 
 Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 The organization works with three main areas: freedom of expression, privacy and securing personal data, authors rights (copyright) and access to knowledge. It carries out research, public outreach campaigns, and proposes public policies in these three areas. It also has publications on internet governance although it is not an official line of work in its stated mission. 
 Major Projects and Events 
 One major axis of work is its publication reports and news (see section below). Eight campaigns have been launched since its foundation which follow the three areas of work outlined above. The first one was a double campaign on author's rights in light of legislative discussions on authors' rights in 2008 (Trato Justo para Todos (Fair Treatment for Everyone), and No Soy Delincuente (I'm Not a Delinquent)). These were followed by four campaigns that have come to a close: Enlazar es Bueno (Linking is Good); an international collaboration with R3D and Access now for Internet Libre MX (Internet is Good Mexico); No Temas a Internet (title has a double meaning, No Topics on Internet/ Don't Fear the Internet) was a campaign for safe digital freedom of expression for privacy rights and against censorship through misuse of copyright; a campaign to involve private companies, grassroots organizations and the Chilean government on privacy and internet access called  Yo &lt;3 Internet  (I &lt;3 Internet). 
 Two more campaigns are ongoing: Internet es Nuestra (The Internet is Ours) and TPP Abierto (Open TPP) . Motivated by the Global Internet Governance Forum the former pushes back on the Free Basics model of free but limited internet provided by private corporations. It asks governments to commit to policies that produce affordable and high-quality open internet access which boosts democratic systems in Latin America. To this end, it highlights policy areas like user privacy protection, freedom of expression and net neutrality as a means to fight against censorship, the right to access culture and knowledge through more proportional copyright, cybersecurity, and the recognition of multi-party input for internet governance. Open TPP is a campaign to bring transparency to the Trans Pacific Partnership negotiations but seems to be halted given the change in the new USA administration. 
 Analysis and Lessons Learned Want to contribute an analysis of this organization? Help us complete this section!Publications 
 Publications of major research began in 2009 with Alberto Cerda's Academic Publishing and Editorial Policies, while their most recent book Who Defends your Information evaluates Chilean ISP companies' responses to government requests for users' personal information. The majority of publications focus on Chile, followed by Latin America at large. There are also reports on Mexico, Columbia, Paraguay, Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Honduras, Panamá, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela. The organization has made several of these publications available in English as well. Some of the publications are the product of collaboration with international organizations like the World Wide Web Foundation, Centre for Internet and Human Rights, the Association for Progressive Communications, and Coding Rights. 
 The organization also publishes short articles on technology, politics, legal analysis on digital events and cybersecurity and has a weekly newsletter the public can sign up for.

 The Lango Youth Development Network (LAYDNET) is a youth-led community-based organization/network based in Lira, northern Uganda. LAYDNET has three specific objective statements (Profile of LAYDNET, 2016). Firstly, it pledges to advocate for the rights of youth with emphasis to women empowerment for economic development (Ibid). Secondly, it promotes health related activities for sustainable growth and development (Ibid). Thirdly, it promotes environmental protection measures for ecological sustainability (Ibid). 
 Origins and Development 
 Otim Moses and Augustine Maurice Okello established LAYDNET in 2008 to help youth who were negatively during the 20-year civil war in northern Uganda between the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) and the Ugandan government. According to the organization, a focus on youth was essential as they are the main segment of the northern Uganda populace that were affected during the war. LAYDNET now has over 350 youth groups registered as part of the network (Profile of LAYDNET, 2016). Currently, at its office in Lira, LAYDNET has 7 full time staff, two volunteers, and two interns (Ibid). 
 Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 LAYDNET is currently seeking funding opportunities. However, in the past year they have received funding from organization such as the MacArthur Foundation and USAID (LAYDNET Annual Report, 2017). 
 Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 LAYDNET’s five-year strategic plan (2013-2018) is to transform into “a highly efficient and transparent youth led institution” (Profile of LAYDNET, 2016). In this process, LAYDNET seeks to empower local youth groups to learn about their rights, learn skills, participate more in their communities, and ultimately find potential funding partners for their innovative ideas (Ibid). If this can be achieved, LAYDNET envisions a context in which youth organizations are “empowered to monitor compliance to development and good governance norms.” (Ibid) 
 Major Projects and Events 
 LAYDNET has implemented various projects over the past few years. These range from projects concerning water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) to projects concerning sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). Within the SGBV projects, for instance, LAYDNET works with young women who have been negatively impacted by the recent war in northern Uganda, which lasted for over 20 years. Many of these female beneficiaries are poor, have contracted HIV/AIDS, and are thus stigmatized in their communities. To respond to this issue, LAYDNET encourages them to join groups which give them a place to connect with other women, as well as train them to run village and saving loan associations successfully (LAYDNET Annual Report, 2017). Through this, many women have been able to start small businesses that earn enough money to pay school fees and afford basic health services (Ibid).

 Housed as a semi-autonomous body within Justice and Reconciliation Project, an NGO based in Gulu, northern Uganda, the Women’s Advocacy Network (WAN) was founded following the 20-year civil war in northern Uganda with a mission “to seek reintegration, reconciliation, and justice for war-affected women” (Justice and Reconciliation Project 2017). WAN is representative of much of the citizen participation in northern Uganda as it is a loose and informal network. 
 Origins and Development 
 Between 1986 and 2006, the rebel group the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) and the Ugandan government were engaged in a brutal conflict that displaced over 1.8 million people and killed over 20,000 people in northern Uganda (Uprooted and Forgotten 13). Women and girls faced some of the worst atrocities during this period, as they were subjected to large-scale sexual abuse by both rebel and government forces. In 2008, the civil war in northern Uganda ended, and from this context WAN emerged. 
 WAN was founded following a University of British Columbia (UBC) storytelling research project that documented the challenges women were facing in post-conflict northern Uganda. According to Grace Acan, a researcher for the project, she and three other researchers felt “it was impossible to just keep quiet and then look on all of these challenges without finding a solution. So we sat down and said why don’t we converge these women, talk to them and then see what they think about, are we going to leave our challenges like this? Isn’t there need to do advocacy on them?” Elaborating later in the interview, Grace explained, “I felt like there was a need for the voices of the voiceless to be heard.” The women they spoke to throughout northern Uganda were receptive, and in May of 2011 this grassroots movement officially became registered as a community-based organization (CBO). 
 Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 As stated on its website, WAN is currently “comprised of 16 grassroots women’s groups within the Acholi, Lango and West Nile sub-regions” (Justice and Reconciliation Project 2017). The network meets four times a year to “discuss advocacy issues, work towards consensus and develop strategies to ensure that issues of contention are addressed.” (Ibid) Originating from the aforementioned UBC research project, WAN is an example of the long-term positive impacts that development/research projects can have on communities in the global south. It also serves as a reminder for donors to broaden the ways in which they monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of development/research projects, as they can have ripple effects on communities for years after the conclusion of a project. 
 Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 WAN specializes in  community organizing  and capacity buidling. Specifically, its programming for war-affected women in northern Uganda has included income generating activities, loans and savings projects, and radio programs (Justice and Reconciliation Project 2017). The radio programs created by WAN has focused on facilitating community dialogue about “the needs and experiences of conflict-affected women and their children”, which the network states has resulted in increased acceptance of war-affected women and children in communities across northern Uganda (Justice and Reconciliation Project 2017). Child tracing and a  petition  to the parliament of Uganda have been two of the major projects in the network’s history. 
 Major Projects and Events Child TracingCurrently, WAN’s major project is focused on child tracing in post-conflict northern Uganda (Grace Acan Interview). The objective of this project is to reunite children born in captivity with their paternal families in order to achieve reconciliation and social cohesion in the region (Justice and Reconciliation Project 2017). One in six female adolescents in northern Uganda were kidnapped by the LRA, and of this number, half bore children to LRA soldiers (Feinstein International Centre 4, 2008). 
 As stated by Grace Acan, the mothers involved in the WAN child tracing project were mostly “given by force to some LRA commanders, who in most cases are not back. They have passed away, or those who are back are not living together [with their family].” According to Grace, the importance of this project cannot be overstated, as in Uganda “children are attached to their father’s side...they don’t belong to their maternal side. If they grow up on their maternal side, I think they are not recognized [in the community], they don’t have inheritance, they don’t look at themselves as people who have identities somewhere.” Here, Grace is alluding to the reality that in northern Uganda it is very difficult for women to own land. As OXFAM stated in a 2014 report on women’s land rights in northern Uganda, “women are dependent on men and cannot own land in their own right under customary tenure and have what many term ‘secondary rights.’” (OXFAM 2) Given this, children growing up with their maternal family may not be recognized in community to the extent that a child would with his/her father present. 
 While Grace said the program has been successful, she also stated that it has faced challenges. In particular, many of the men who fought for the LRA are difficult to find. When they are found, Grace stated that it is “hard for the paternal family to accept very fast...because they are not sure whether this is the right child.” Due to this, WAN, in cooperation with other NGOs in the area, facilitates dialogues between the maternal and paternal families to ensure reconciliation and the acceptance of the child. PetitioningAnother major project implemented by WAN was a petition presented to the parliament of Uganda which advocated for redress regarding war-affected women. Grace described how the women who spear-headed this project “were vocal, they were open, they were not afraid.” As stated on their website, the petition resulted in “the passing of a resolution by parliament, which hopefully will result in programs and policies to meet women’s needs” (Justice and Reconciliation Project 2017). However, as of today, there has been no official policy legislated by the parliament of Uganda, highlighting the difficulty of affecting change in policy at the government level. Nonetheless, this is a unique form of citizen participation in a context where ordinary people rarely challenge the government openly.

 The Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) began as, and in many ways remains, an armed uprising against the Mexican state, however, it frames its goals and actions in political, rather than military, terms. According to the movement's ""anti-leader"" Subcomandante Marcos: “In a war, the decisive thing is not the military confrontation but the politics at stake in the confrontation. We didn’t go to war to kill or be killed. We went to war in order to be heard.” Marcos’ prolific writing, along with the movement’s persistent outreach efforts and savvy media campaigns, have inspired radicals all over the world to demand autonomy and rise up against their governments and corporate overlords.[1]

Box 2109,Malawi,-13.9888233,33.7666726,,,,,,,,,,,,,,economics, human, human,,"  Mission and PurposeThe Centre for Community Organisation and Development’s (CCODE) mission is to be “a leading institution in empowering organizations of the poor in Malawi to be socio-economically self-reliant through capacity building initiatives.” (CCODE, 2017) In an interview with Executive Director Sungani Chalemba, Mr. Chalemba emphasized that alleviating urban poverty is also a major focus for the organization. He stated that, “for quite so long in Malawi, one of the challenges we have been having is that the focus has always been on the rural base and neglecting the urban areas. Yet, when we look at the statistics, it shows that Malawi is one of the fastest urbanizing countries.” In fact, the World Bank found that in 2015, Malawi had the 25th highest urban population growth in the world (World Bank). Elaborating, Mr. Chalemba described how, “more and more people, they are moving into the cities. Yet, the government keeps on living in denial and neglects its duty...it is happy to collect the taxes and revenue from the poor people but it doesn’t wish even to provide services.” CCODE’s purpose is to make a difference in the lives of the Malawian poor. 
 Origins and Development 
 A Zimbabwean woman named Sikhu Nkhoma founded CCODE in 2003. Prior to creating CCODE, Ms. Nkhoma worked for Dialogue on Shelter, an organization that implemented projects aimed at alleviating urban poverty in Zimbabwe. In Malawi, Ms. Nkhoma observed a void in organizations addressing urban poverty and thus founded the organization. 
 Organizational Structure and Funding 
 Executive Director Sungani Chalemba leads CCODE, an organization that has 35 paid staff. CCODE is affiliated with Slum Dwellers International, and thus, according to Mr. Chalemba, “the principles and the thinking that it [CCODE] has been championing is just like a replica of Slum Dwellers.” In addition to Slum Dwellers International, CCODE receives funding from UN Habitat, Tilitonse Fund, and a host of other organizations. However, Mr. Chalemba described that “our funds keep shrinking....I don’t know what is happening, the financing for development keeps shrinking...so there are very little resources that are trickling into countries like Malawi and organizations like ourselves.” 
 In terms of CCODE’s structured alliance with FRUP, there is currently a coordinators meeting between the top management of CCODE and the national leaders of FRUP once a month. Here, all the issues that have been identified at the regional, district, and zone levels of FRUP are shared between the two organizations. 
 Specializations and activities 
 CCODE specializes in capacity-building initiatives for the rural and urban poor of Malawi. In order to achieve this end, CCODE implements various activities such as its ‘slum upgrading project’, which seeks to re-plan informal settlements in urban areas by deepening “poor people’s participation in policy formulation and implementation.” (CCODE, 2017) To-date, over 70 communities throughout Malawi have been involved in this project (Ibid). During slum upgrading processes, issues of water access, sanitation, infrastructure, etc. have been identified by communities as areas in need of urgent improvement. Explaining the reasoning behind this participatory approach, Mr. Chalemba stated that if one were to ask experts about how to re-plan informal settlements, they would likely say “bring bulldozers and demolish everything and we can build these big megacities.” However, Mr. Chalemba is adamantly against this idea, stating, “that will not work. Especially in a poor country like Malawi....you have to move from the top ladder to start thinking about what to do, because like I have said, this country – 85% are poor, so there is no way Malawi should have all its training [and decision making] geared towards the remaining 15%.” Mr. Chalemba stated that, although the government was sceptical at the beginning of this project, they have started to warm up to the concept as they are realizing that by incorporating the poor into these urban planning processes, there are less protests and setbacks. 
 In order to undertake the above slum upgrading projects, CCODE often implements Community Data for Change (CDfC) projects, which look to empower communities to “generate data about their communities through situational analysis: community profiling, mapping and community-led enumerations.” (CCODE, 2017) These CDfC projects often result in informative maps that can be distributed to government and civil society actors so that they can make more informed public policy decisions. 
 Major projects and events 
 CCODE is involved in various different initiatives. In terms of the initiatives that CCODE alone implements, each revolves around the following thematic areas: development of poor people’s organizations, community data for change, basic services and infrastructure, and skills and livelihoods (CCODE, 2017). Partnership with the Federation for the Rural and Urban PoorA unique activity of CCODE is its alliance with the Federation of the Rural and Urban Poor (FRUP), a grassroots network with a membership of over 80,000 people in Malawi that trains communities “in fields such as the importance of daily community savings, income generation, and general community development” (CCODE, 2017). Established in 2003 just before CCODE, Mr. Chalemba recounts how FRUP quickly “grew so big, to the point that they could not coordinate it all. So there was need to have professional staff”. It was out of this issue that the alliance was formed, as the membership of FRUP determined that its positive momentum could not be maintained without the administrative, financial, and development guidance/support provided by CCODE. 
 Analysis and Lessons Learned 
 CCODE has had numerous achievements since its founding, including securing tenure and decent housing for over 1,000 households, as well as improving sanitation for over 2,500 households (CCODE, 2017).

In an interview with the top management of FRUP, one female national leader described why there was such an emphasis on female participation, explaining that “men are usually off to work and women are not working, most of them are housewives. So, it was something that we embraced because we were readily available and it was also something that we knew we could take part in.”  The federation quickly grew in popularity. A different national leader described how she discovered FRUP in 2003, stating, “I had started seeing these women getting together, doing their savings everyday. I was just seeing these people who were able to save and after six months share the money, supporting their husbands. So, I was so interested in joining the group because I had seen the improvement that the other women were able to achieve. So that’s why I joined the group, to improve my life through the savings from the federation groups.” She continued and identified two other reasons why FRUP was attractive to her. Firstly, she described how happy she was at “being able to keep your money not in the bank”. Secondly, she stated that, “I was also interested in just joining the group because I have learned a lot from the other women who participate in the federation.”  Stories like this are widespread and amounted to tens of thousands of women joining the federation in its early stages of operation. Ultimately, membership grew to 80,000 people, so large that FRUP made the decision to join an alliance with CCODE, which could provide administrative, financial and development guidance. Today, FRUP “operates in 26 districts across Malawi, and over 80 per cent of its members are women. Women are central to the organization. The majority of members live in poor urban and rural communities.” (CCODE, 2017)  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The Federation of the Rural and Urban Poor (FRUP) has a current membership of 80,000 people. There are five distinct networks within the structure of FRUP. These are: skills and livelihoods, construction, slum upgrading, waste for worth, and savings. Each network has a national leader, and once a month these leaders meet with the top management of CCODE to discuss issues that have been identified at the regional, district, and zone levels. FRUP receives its funding from CCODE and is affiliated with Slum Dwellers International.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Although FRUP originally only specialized in savings groups, the federation has evolved. There is now five networks within FRUP that all focus on specific areas of development. They are: skills and livelihoods, construction, slum upgrading, waste for worth, and savings. Regardless of this expansion, savings is still the major focus of FRUP and thus savings is a crosscutting theme of the Federation.  Major Projects and Events  As mentioned above, the major project of FRUP is aimed at encouraging the poor, specifically, women, to save. Members save daily and meet weekly throughout the country.

 In Tunisia, unemployment generally, and unemployment of youth who are not enrolled in education, employment, or training (NEETs) in particular, is a severe social, economic, and cultural problem. Variance is observable along socio-economic, geographic, and gender indices. 
 The UDC is the oldest and most important organization that groups unemployed persons in Tunisia under one umbrella. Its slogan: “Work, Freedom, National Dignity” dates back to 2006. It also became the master frame of the Tunisian uprising, also known as the ‘Jasmine Revolution.’ The purpose of the UDC was to fill the vacuum in representation created between the UGET (L'Union générale des étudiants de Tunisie) student’s union and the UGTT (L'Union générale tunisienne du travail) labor union in Tunisia. The creation of the UDC responded to a significant threat to local, independent, and unsanctioned groups dedicated to unemployed graduates in the country. Namely, it was often the case that regime officials would arrest one group without the knowledge of the others. This left all groups vulnerable and without recourse to legal action or counsel. Prior to the organization’s establishment, there was no formal leadership structure or communication strategy for channeling concerns or efforts over the rights of unemployed graduates in Tunisia. 
 Origins and Development Unemployment in TunisiaForeign direct investment (FDI) and trade liberalization policies in the 1990s and 2000s made some small achievements in economic policies, but the outcome served to be especially difficult for those living in the interior regions, youth, and unemployed graduates. Between 2005-2007, FDI reached 13 percent in Tunisia, but after reaching its height at $3.3 billion in 2006, it fell by 54 percent between 2006-2010. As Pfeifer argues, liberalization of FDI was supposed to encourage small to medium enterprises (SMEs) and stimulate job creation, but since foreign direct investment was Gulf-sourced and “favored megaprojects in real estate such as hotels, tourist resorts, and luxury shopping malls, and fully or partially privatized public works, such as ports, airports, and utilities,” they ultimately “created temporary jobs in construction but, except for tourism, few permanent jobs” (Pfeifer 2016, 35). Thus, even where FDI was committed to labor-intensive manufacturing for export, “the quality of jobs and impact on the domestic economy were questionable” (ibid). 
 Despite the fact that Tunisia boasts a strong and sizeable middle class and an above-average education compared to many other countries in the region (Arieff and Humud 2015), the mismatch between the demand for private and public sector jobs with the quality and type of education received is a notable problem. Over the past decade, two-thirds of Tunisia’s youth were enrolled in tertiary education. However, after 2000, secondary school course work was geared towards students passing final examinations instead of centering on the skills and knowledge necessary for the job market. This policy shift resulted from the 60-70 percent failure rate in secondary school examinations. Thus, though 64 percent of students passed their final exams in 2011, this change is attributed to alterations in exam rules, not in desirable learning achievements and outcomes (Drisi, 2014). It is no surprise, then, that one-quarter of those NEET are tertiary education graduates (World Bank 2012a; 2012b). 
 Youth unemployment in Tunisia is currently around 31%, with estimates at around 50% for some cities of the interior (Ben Ali and Saha 2016). According to a recent World Bank (2015) report, in rural areas, 20.6 percent of older men and 46.9 percent of young men are NEET. In urban areas, 13.1 percent of older men and 34.6 percent of young men are NEET. Nearly twice as many young women (60.2 percent) are NEET than men. In urban Tunisia, one-third of young women (32.4 percent) and one-fifth of all young men (20.3 percent) are NEET. 
 While unemployment rates in Tunisia hovered between 12.5 and 18.3 in the 2006-2011 period, unemployment rates among higher education graduates was 17 percent in 2006 and rose to 29.2 percent in 2011 (Acikoz et al. 2015, 55). As many as 40 percent of the 605,000 unemployed people in Tunisia hold advanced degrees. The Tunisian economy produces around 30,000 new jobs annually for those with bachelor’s degrees. However, its 25 technical institutes and 12 public universities matriculate 70,000 students per year, according to the Ministry of Higher Education. Job recruitment is rife with inequities—a legacy of authoritarianism for which residents of the mining town of Gafsa rose up in 2008 and from which the ‘Jasmine Revolution’ is often said to have sprung. Family connections, bribery, nepotism, and regionalism account for the lion’s share of recruitment inequities (Drisi, 2014). The Evolution of the UDCThe UDC went through a number of stages of development. Its membership and leadership came overwhelmingly from the ranks of the UGET. The UDC was unofficially founded in 2006, and it became a registered organization with the Ministry of Interior (MOI) only after the successful ouster of Ben Ali in 2011. 
 In 2004-2005, independent groups and individuals began to protest lack of government accountability, nepotism, and corruption in hiring practices across Tunisia’s governorates. Local chapters of the UDC came into being when members from these independent groups met in Tunis at the beginning of 2005 to discuss their collective grievances over securing the rights of unemployed people. At that time, there were six regional organizations, in: Tunis, Karouan, Beja, Gabes, Gafsa, and Gasserine. These groups established a non-registered and unofficially sanctioned organization in 2006 that remained illegal until 2011. 
 Between 2006-2008, the Ben Ali regime practiced an admixture of cooptation and ‘capture and release’ tactics with members of the UDC, either tempting local leaderships with job prospects or jailing protesters en masse for short periods of time. Manouba University was a stronghold for the UGET. As such, the UDC would often meet there in order to consult with the UGET and hold its own meetings. The first UDC election took place at Manouba University in April 2006 where the UDC elected 13 members to its leadership council. At that time, its membership agreed upon and documented its internal regulations. On May 25, 2006, the UDC attempted to officially register the organization with the MOI, but their request was denied. Aymin Rizki, a journalist with Hiwar Tunsi, accompanied the UDC to the MOI in order to document the event. His camera was broken and he was beaten publicly in front of the Ministry. Rizki retold many such incidents in his reportage of the UDC. 
 Between 2006-7 the UDC scheduled small protests in front of different ministries in the capital. The UDC would often mobilize at 9 April University in order to draw large crowds of support and march to the Kasbah Square (where the Prime Ministry, Ministry of Finance, and City Council are located). Police would respond by flooding the square with armored cars and police officials, but the protesters would lie on the ground to shield groups of protesters for short stints while making public their grievances to onlookers. These and other tactics raised the profile of the organization and garnered local sympathies with those witnessing regime abuse. 
 In 2008, likely in response to the Gafsa uprising, the regime stepped up its reprisals of UDC protests and began sentencing protesters for up to 5-years. UDC membership and leadership experienced intensifying repression in the form of surveillance, physical violence, jailing, and blacklisting (Interview with Salem Ayari, 2017). As a result, the leadership among regional organizations would often meet in university classrooms, where university police were not permitted, or in crowded public spaces, to avoid detection. One tactic reported in an interview by the author with UDC board member Souhail Idoudi (2017) was to meet in coffee shops while playing cards in order to hide in plain sight. In doing so, police and intelligence officers would be unable to monitor their conversations. At the end of each meeting, those in attendance would agree on a subsequent meeting time and place. 
 Nonetheless, from 2008 until the revolution, the UDC was able to organize and participate in a number of social movements across the country, extending their networks of influence to Ben Ghardane and Karouan and among local opposition groups. As a result, when the 2010-2011 revolution started the UDC was well positioned to lead protests. Indeed, upon the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi in Sidi Bouzid in December, 2010—the single act often attributed as the catalyst to the ‘Jasmine Revolution’ and ‘Arab Spring’—the UDC was one of the first groups to carry out organized protests throughout Tunisia. Upon the ouster of Ben Ali, the UDC was granted legal status in June 18, 2011. At the height of their activism, they were able to mobilized 14,000 people across the country (Interview with Salem Ayari, 2017). 
 Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 Upon formalizing the umbrella organization in 2006 (though still illegal), the regional offices of the UDC were able to act in concert with one another and with the support of the UGET, UGTT, LTDH (Ligue Tunisienne pour la Défense des Droits de l'Homme), Tunisian Communist Worker’s Party, and the Tunisian Bar Association, among others, which greatly strengthened their organizational capacity and impact. 
 Members are restricted to individuals with a post-graduate degree, vocational training, or holders of a training certificate who are unemployed (not working under a full-time contract). Membership costs 3 Tunisian Dinars (TD) every two years. To date, 5000 individuals are registered members of the UDC. 
 At present, there are twenty-four bureaus across Tunisia’s twenty-four governorates. Bureaus must have at least five members to be qualified as active. All members are eligible for election to leadership positions. Leadership positions of local or regional offices are contested in elections. Positions are held for two years. However, if members of the leadership find employment or step down, snap elections can be held. In addition, leadership positions are sometimes granted through consensus. If members of a bureau are not satisfied with the performance of members of the leadership they can hold new elections based on low confidence. 
 Leadership positions are as follows: Local Coordinator 
 Manager of Internal Regulations 
 Communications Director 
 Treasurer 
 Archivist Regional offices have the autonomy to start any protest they want, about any issue, at any time. The only stipulation according to internal UDC regulations is that the leadership of the regional office in question must sign a document on the proposed action. Oftentimes, one bureau will inform the national office of their proposed action, and solidarity protests will be held in concert with other regions. There is a specific board for the planning and implementation of national meetings that is based on input of the leadership from all the regions. National meetings are held three or four times a year in which the leadership is able to enact new rules. FundingSince the UDC was not permitted legal status until 2011, government-sanctioned organizations would be put at risk if they provided the UDC with recordable sources of funding. However, members of the UDC leadership report a number of unofficial and in-kind contributions. Individuals from UGET and UGTT contributed small amounts of money (up to 100 Tunisian Dinars) to fund transportation, printing, meetings and other expenses. The UGTT also helped the UDC to secure office space at minimal rates. The Bar Association provides perhaps the most essential services: pro-bono legal council for members of the UDC. To date, those arrested by the UDC are offered legal representation and advice. Hamma Hammami and his Tunisian Worker’s Communist Party, as well as the party paper (for which Hammami was the editor), al-Badil, influenced the early ideological and organizational makeup of the UDC, in large part due to its support of the UGET. 
 After the revolution, the UDC received two funding packages from EuroMed. The first allocation provided the UDC with equipment and office space. The second allocation was used for training and leadership programs, including both internal training as well as sessions organized in partnership with the UGTT and LTDH, university professors, and specialists in human resources and conflict management. 
 Specializations and Activities 
 The UDC is particularly influential in mobilizing public demonstrations, protests, and coordinating opposition to government policies (Chaine UDC Tunisie). They were one of the first (and only) major associations to hold organized mobilizations across the country prior to, during, and after the revolution. Some of their tactics include  protest marches ,  sit-ins , and hunger strikes. 
 Major Projects and Events 
 Recent examples of the Union's provide evidence of the group's influence and ability to mobilize large numbers of individuals. However, outcomes of these actions are not demonstrable in terms of shifts of government policy. Sidi Bouzid ProtestsOn January 18, 2016 citizens of Sidi Bouzid planned a sit-in responding to the lack of government job creation following successive governments and unfulfilled promises. In the process of demonstrating, Ridha Yahyaoui, a 28-year old protester, was accidentally electrocuted to death after climbing a telephone pole. One week following the January 18 sit-in, the UDC, along with the LTDH and UGTT, called for a demonstration in Sidi Bouzid, arguing that the government pledged to hold a meeting with the protestors. “Last week, he promised us a meeting to hear our demands for development and employment. But he cancelled everything at the last minute without giving a valid explanation,” Atef Affi, a UDC member of Sidi Bouzid, reported (Szakal, 2016). 
 One measurable outcome from the series of hunger strikes that the UDC has supported or helped to organize is the hiring of 180 persons previously among the 774 blacklisted by the Ben Ali regime (African Manager, 2016). According to Salem Ayari, Secretary General of the UDC, the union is in continued talks with the government to have the remaining blacklisted persons removed (Interview with Salem Ayari, 2017). Mnich Masameh MovementThe UDC and UGET joined the burgeoning Mnich Msameh (“I will not forgive”) movement—a series protests held over government unaccountability and corruption sparked by an economic reconciliation bill that attempts to give amnesty to economic and political elites guilty of administrative and financial crimes under the Ben Ali regime. Those who come forward anonymously to the government must pay a maximum 5% interest rate, along with the original sum, back to the government (Marzouk, 2016); yet there is scant indication that those who have hidden their paper trails well will do so, leaving many to call this an ‘amesty’ rather than a ‘reconcilliation’ (Guellali, 2017). The economic reconciliation bill continues to be one of the most contentious issues in Tunisia. As of May, 2017, the proposed bill has been shot down by parliament twice, largely due to the sustained campaigns against it. At the time of writing, the bill is being rewritten for submission to parliament for a third time. Expansion in North AfricaThe UDC is also in the process of discussing a North African Unemployed Graduate’s Union. They have been in contact with their Moroccan counterpart since 2012, when a conference on unemployed graduates was hosted in Morocco alongside delegations from Italy, Algeria, Spain, Morocco, and France. The last meeting occurred in 2013 in Algeria. However, the meeting was cut short when police detained the Algerian participants and the Tunisian members were expelled back to Tunisia. There are plans to meet at the Youth Social Forum, and the Moroccan Union for Unemployed Graduates are invited to Tunis to attend the UDC’s national meeting this year (2017) to pick up where the discussions left off.

Please help us verify its content.Mission and Purpose 
 The Global Shapers Community is “a network of Hubs developed and led by young people who are exceptional in their potential, their achievements and their drive to make a contribution to their communities” (Global Shapers World Economic Forum website). 
 The Global Shapers Tunis Hub Charter is an ambitious document that lays the groundwork for the Hub’s activities. According to the Charter, the Hub’s mission is to: “Articulate a compelling vision for Sustainable Competitiveness (a development model that balances economic prosperity, environmental stewardship and social responsibility) in Tunisia, and help translate that vision into concrete and actionable projects and results.” The GSTH ‘” envision[s] a Tunisia where citizens are aware of their high potential to be an asset to society and believe in a society that encourages creative thinking, innovative ideas, productive partnerships and efficient problem solving.” The ‘Values’ section of the charter stipulates that: “Among us are superstars, humble geniuses, innovative entrepreneurs, and inspiring artists, each from different parts of the city with impressively varied personal and professional backgrounds. We believe that it is with this diversity that we will ensure we have a positive impact in our country and that we operate in a core set of values of which we prioritize transparency, inclusiveness, creativity, professionalism and sustainability.” Section ‘b’ of the ‘Behavior’ section notes: “All Global Shapers will work and act to improve the state of the world.” 
 Origins and Development 
 The Global Shapers is “an initiative of the World Economic Forum” (WEF) (Global Shapers website). To date, there are 438 hubs and 5574 active members worldwise. 
 Conceived and implemented initially in Western Europe, by 2012 the Tunis hub was among the first worldwide to gain full operation and implementation. At the time, each hub was responsible for establishing its own system of governance and programming. The GSTH was considered exemplary in the frequency of its meetings, the cohesiveness of its initial cohort, and its outreach and programming such that, along with the London hub, the WEF featured the GSTH as a model in its first promotional video. According to Nadia Boulifa, the GSTH Founding Curator, the Tunisia Hub was frequently asked to participate in events in order to lend its expertise to other hubs in the incipient years of the Global Shapers program. 
 Since its inception, the GSTH has identified a number of themes specific to Tunisia’s political transition. In 2011-2012, these included social business, citizenship, and culture. After 2012, the GSTH identified economic prosperity, environmental stewardship, and social sustainability as overarching concerns to which GSTH projects would cohere. However, recent GSTH projects extend to the role of youth in fighting corruption, and gender and women’s rights. 
 Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 While applications are accepted year-round, recruitment membership typically occurs between June and August. New recruits enter into a probationary period of six months, and the executive board makes a final decision based on the entrant’s performance in accordance with the Charter. 
 According to the GSTH Charter, in order to be eligible to apply, applicants: Must be 20-30 years old at the time of application; 
 Be residents of the Greater Tunis Area and have significant ties to Tunis that would enable them to fully participate in the Community’s activities; 
 Commit to regularly engage in the Hub’s physical and virtual activities throughout the year; 
 Are expected to have already demonstrated their creativity and ability to contribute to the Tunis Hub and the Global Shaper Community at large. (Global Shapers Tunis Hub Charter) The first generation of Tunisian Global Shapers held meetings according to project aims and recruitment requirements. The subsequent generation codified a structure for the organization and its meetings in the Charter as follows. The Tunis Hub’s executive board maintains administrative tasks, including the association’s status and activities with the World Economic Forum as well as its financial account. Formal positions are allocated based on the needs of the hub according to its ongoing and newly conceived activities. Activities are classified into two axes: those related to the management of the hub, and those related to specific projects. 
 Meetings are divided into four areas: general meetings, projects meetings, executive board meetings, and curatorship meetings. General meetings are open to all Global Shapers. They are held every month independently from the hub’s activities. Projects meetings occur between members related to a given project. Other Global Shapers are also welcome to participate. Executive board meetings occur between members of the board exclusively. Curatorship meetings occur annually in July-August as an “initiation party” for the new recruits. At this meeting, the new creator is afforded the opportunity to present plans for upcoming meetings for the year. According to the Charter, “The shapers should democratically vote for a new Curator and incoming Curator every year in Mar[ch]. The vote is conducted online and ALL shapers MUST participate” (emphasis in the original). 
 According to the Charter, amendments are forwarded to the Curator via email, and the Curator must raise the amendment at the following general meeting so long as the email is received one week prior to the meeting. The proposed amendment is debated and voted upon so long as a 60% quorum is achieved. Amendments require the agreement of 80% of Global Shapers present at the meeting. Members who are not physically present in the meeting are not eligible to vote, thought they may submit “opinions” prior to the meeting. Probationary Global Shapers are ineligible to vote. Funding and SupportA not-for-profit organization registered in Switzerland, Klaus Schwab, the WEF’s founder and executive chairman, founded the organization in 2011. A Global Shapers Foundation Board that includes notable political and economic elites runs the organization. Partnering entities, which contribute funding to select local hubs’ initiatives, and to conferences and other Global Shapers events, include: Salesforce, The Coca Cola Company, Reliance Industries, Adecco, CJSC Ulmart, Crescent Petroleum, GMR Group, Hanwha Energy, MiSK, and Vision 3. Finally, funding comes in the form of membership dues as all shapers must pay the yearly fee of 50 Tunisian Dinars for students or 100 Tunisian Dinars for professionals. 
 Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 The GSTH specializes in the organization and implementation of both large- and small-scale, global and local participatory events. Their work involves the use of numerous methods of engagement including multi-stakeholder meetings,  participatory  and  civic education ,  participatory arts ,  community health care  and  online and digital outreach . Many of their activities are carried out in partnership with other organizations such as their youth  deliberations  and  social forums  during the World Economic Forum's Shaping Davos Series. 
 Major Projects and Events 
 The Hub has executed projects, co-organized, and held a number of events with considerable community outreach and public exposure. The first program implemented by the GSTH, hosted in June 2012, identified the need to bring back the oral tradition of folkloric storytelling and promoting Tunisian culture. In addition to a storyteller and live music, the project involved bringing donated books as a way to promote “libraries on wheels.” 
 Another program implemented in 2012 aimed to help an educational program to move from a business model based on grants and donations to a social business capable of generating its own independent revenue stream. The program, La Ferme Thérapeutique de Sidi Thabet, serves as both a full-time educational facility to Tunisian youth with physical and mental disabilities, as well as a working farm that sells its products locally. The program reaches over 100 youths ages 8 to 33 and employs 40 members of staff who provide traditional schooling, vocational training, and emotional and physical therapy to students. The ultimate goal of the program is to help the children acquire the skills to become independent and find gainful employment after ‘graduation’. While falling short of transitioning the project to a fully sustainable business model, the GSTH was successful in contributing to a review of the branding, communication, and marketing strategies, including the association’s packaging, products, and the identification of new distribution channels. The GSTH also contributed to the educational component, helping La Ferme with its pedagogical and employment services by aiding in the recruitment and training of interns, psychology students, and licensed professionals. 
 On December 6, 2012, The World Economic Forum (WEF) organized a roundtable entitled: “Advancing Tunisia’s Economic Transition.” The event brought together members of the Tunisian government, foreign investors, local businesspeople, and the Global Shapers Tunis Hub. The roundtables were featured around a number of themes, including Tunisia’s political transition and imperatives for short and long-term governance, competitiveness, youth employment, managing risks and securing investments, and building institutions for effective governance. These included also the challenges posed by corruption. 
 On March 13, 2013, The African Development Bank and Yunus Social Business organized a conference in Tunisia on social business awareness to address unemployment in the country. The GSTH sat on the organizing committee. 
 The GSTH held a number of events in concert with the Shaping Davos Series. Shaping Davos is a yearly event organized by selected Global Shapers hubs from around the world to pair with the World Economic Davos meeting, which brings together influential political and economic elites to address local issues. The outcomes of the events are shared with the global community. The 2013 WEF conference on investment in Tunisian ran in parallel to a conference on sustainable competitiveness organized by the Global Shapers. The WEF conference was important because the forum framed the thinking that the WEF adopted and applied as a worldwide index, which included social inclusiveness and environmental sustainability in its metrics. The GSTH roundtable became a key opportunity for shapers to build business community ties and gain support for individual members’ future projects and events both within the GSTH and independent from it. 
 On January 19, 2015 the GSTH hosted the event “Making Governments Younger” which included a public debate on the motion: “Tunisian youth are ready to be in power.” Government representatives, civil society organizations, and media personalities debated the motion in front of a live audience as part of the Shaping Davos local series. Also as part of the Shaping Davos local series, on January 25, 2015, the GSTH organized an event on youth and political participation under the theme ‘Rethinking and transforming politics through discussing old practices and promoting new approaches to boost youth political participation.’ Most recently, on 17 January, 2017, the Shaping Davos theme addressed the topic: “Corruption, Accountability and the Rule of Law.” The GSTH organized a dialogue session entitled “What Role does Tunisian Youth Play in Fighting Corruption?” that once more brought together civil society organizations, representatives of government, and private stakeholders to discuss and debate these themes. 
 The Global shapers are frequently invited to take part in WEF meetings in order to represent Tunisian youth and share the Tunisian experience with international leaders and experts during forums, discussions, and formal dinners. Four members of the GSTH attended the WEF MENA in 2014. One member of the GSTH attended WEF Africa conference in 2016, and two members of the GTSH attended the 2017 WEF MENA conference.

 After a century of land disputes, the people of Jemna reclaimed their land during the “Jasmine Revoluton” of 2010-2011. Two days before the January 14 ouster of longstanding dictator Zine el Abidine Ben Ali, the youth of Jemna occupied the date plantation long viewed as a symbol of colonialism and corruption and, along with elders from the town, established the ‘Association for the Protection of Jemna’s Oasis’ (APJO). Rather than acquiescing to the demands of locals to have full autonomy over their land, however, the Tunisian state has employed several tactics to maintain a measure of control over the APJO and its resources, including freezing its financial accounts and threatening the association and its buyers with fines and sanctions. In spite of the vast increase in productivity and impressive redistributive mechanisms that Jemna has put in place to benefit the region through the profits of its date yields (that pale in comparison to the productive capacity of previous operators), the government refuses to allocate ownership of the land to the APJO. Instead, the state continues to offer arrangements that the town of Jemna considers inimical to its project of local autonomy. 
 Jemna thus serves as an example of successful grass-roots mobilization and cooperative economics. As exemplar, the APJO also threatens the state’s claims to be able to provide for its citizens at a time when the legitimacy and confidence in state institutions and political parties is at an all-time low (Yahya, 2016). The ‘case’ of Jemna is in the spotlight. If reached, a future resolution will undoubtedly be considered as a precedent for other towns in the south of Tunisia making similar land claims. The cooperative model may also stand as a challenge to Tunisia’s decades long neo-liberal turn. 
 Origins and Development 
 The south of Tunisia is famous for its  deglet nour , or ‘dates of light.’ Initially sold or seized to be cultivated by the French under colonial occupation, agricultural land has gone through a number of hands since independence—from state-led cooperative enterprises with titular ownership sometimes returned to the original tribes and families under Bourguiba, to sales or confiscations—whether coercive or altogether illegal—under the Ben Ali regime. The Tunisian state is struggling to provide its citizens (especially in the marginalized south) with any hope that their post-authoritarian economic policies will benefit the very individuals and communities who rose up against the former regime in 2010-2011. High unemployment and poverty rates, rampant corruption, and growing dissatisfaction continue to yield an unwieldy population of aggrieved citizens who mobilize and protest en masse against a dilatory state bent on maintaining similar neo-liberal economic policies that brought about calls for ‘freedom, justice, and national dignity’ prior to, during, and following the Tunisian uprising ( TAP , 2017). Some suspect a ‘second revolution’ is in the waiting (Yerkes, 2017). 
 While the myth of the founding of Jemna dates back centuries, the townspeople’s claim to a collective identity is traced on paper to an 1879 decree issued by the Bey at the request of the local governor, Hamid Beh Hammad, to exempt denizens of Jemna from paying taxes on the grounds that they provided preeminent religious education throughout the region. The year 1881 marks ‘official’ French colonialism (Anderson, 1986), yet it was not until 1912 when the French made their presence felt in Jemna upon appropriating and seizing lands from local families and tribes in order to establish a date plantation for export back to France. 
 At independence, in 1956, the French had reportedly left 3600 mature and productive palm trees in Jemna’s oasis farmland. Under then President Habib Bourguiba—the founding father of modern Tunisia—residents signed a promise for sale of the trees (but not the land) from the state for 80,000 dinars. Locals raised 40,000 dinars by variously fundraising and selling off their property and gold, and they were advised to put the funds into the account of Governor Hamed Bin Lallouna. The contract was nullified by the state, however, and the governor is accused of using the capital to invest in semi-public companies: hotels and import/export businesses (Interview with Taher Etahri; Szakal, 2016). 
 Following an aggressive state-led socio-cultural modernization program (Gallagher, 1968), Bourguiba’s dirigiste policies turned to restructuring the economy, including the ambitious imposition of a nation-wide agricultural cooperative program. Hiring Ahmed Ben Salah as ‘super-Minister’ of Planning, Economy, and Education on May 12, 1964, Bourguiba signed into law N°64-5, the nationalization of 800,000 hectares of French colonial land. While, under the cooperative program, legal title was returned to deed-holding families, in practice all former French colonial land was managed by the  conseil d’administration  (Simmons, 1970; Ashford 1967, 1973). 
 With few exceptions, the cooperative initiative was deemed a failure (Stone, 1971), and by 1968 a political crisis led to its collapse (Simmons, 1971). However, months before the announcement the end of the cooperative system, STIL ( Société Tunisienne de l’Industrie Laitière ), a state-owned public company with private investors within members of Tunisia’s political and economic elite, leased the land. STIL managed Jemna’s date farm until its bankruptcy in 2001, and a year later the Ben Ali regime leased the land to two private investors for a nominal sum through the Ministry of State Properties and Land Affairs. The government also forced residents to sell their land on the adjacent side of the main thoroughfare to private investors for one dinar per 150 hectares (which was later struck down by the courts in 2004). 
 Jemna’s land disputes under the Ben Ali regime continued until two days before the longstanding dictator’s ouster when, on January 12, 2011, youth from Jemna affiliated with the ‘League for the Protection of the Revolution’ (Patel and Belghith, 2013) peacefully occupied the date farm, asking personnel to vacate in order to encamp there. The army maintained a presence alongside the main road to Jemna, and on February 27, 2011 they attempted to reinstate the land to the two investors, but to no avail. Taher Etahri, in his role as Secretary General of the Secondary Education Teachers Union with close ties to the town youth, was called in to mediate. The ‘League for the Protection of the Revolution’ ceded authority to the newly created ‘Association for the Protection of the Jemna’s Oasis’ as the body that, to date, represents the town in its every interaction with the state—with Mr. Taher Etahri voted in as President. 
 Following failed negotiations with the army, the government invited the APJO to sit with the investors, whose offer of partial ownership of the land and profits was flatly refused. Negotiations went from the local to the national as political parties attempted to insert themselves into the fray and word of Jemna’s struggle for, and success in, local autonomy over its resources gained momentum. In the five years of Jemna’s cooperative enterprise, the APJO reinvested its revenues—approximately 1.5 million dinars (Hamouchene, 2017)—in local projects, building classrooms and a gym in a local school, a covered souq [market] for dates, financing the purchase of an ambulance to operate throughout the region, establishing a centre for children with special needs, and donating to charities throughout the region. 
 In September 2016, the Ministry of State Properties and Land Affairs threatened to cancel the APJO’s tenders. On September 15 2016, just three days before the auction was set to take place, a tribunal ruled in favor of the state’s claim of ownership over the land. As the harvest season neared, Jemna proceeded with the auction illegally, and one day later, on October 10 2016, the Ministry of State Property and Land Affairs released a statement promising prosecution, freezing also the account of Said Joudi, who bought the APJO’s seasonal yield (MosaiqueFM, 2017) 
 On January 19, 2017 the APJO met with the government. Three months after the harvest, two proposals bore fruit. The first, suggested by Minister of Agriculture Samir Bettaieb, was the creation of a Cooperative Union of Agricultural Production (UCPA). The UCPA would calculate the salaries and overhead costs for the upcoming year, and the state would appropriate the remainder. The second proposal, advanced by Mabrouk Korchid, began with the state selling the yield for 2016 on the understanding that the APJO would then be given the opportunity to rent the property from the state as a legal commercial entity for a 30-year period (Djilali, 2016). Korchid then offered a 49/51 per cent split between the people of Jemna and the government, respectively, in perpetuity. Following further negotiations, Korchid suggested a 66/34 per cent split between Jemna and the government. That proposal was later augmented in Jemna’s favor to 75/25, in which the people of Jemna would lease the state’s land for 25 to 30 years renewable with the state willing to resell its shares after 4 or 5 years, pending the continued high performance of the APJO. On this agreement, 75 per cent of the profits would go to the people of Jemna, and the state would promise to redistribute its 25 per cent back to the region. The people of Jemna held a meeting and reached quasi-unanimity on 22 January. The people of Jemna were awaiting Korchid’s agreement to be put into print with a 30 January deadline (Baron, 2017). The timeline for the government to offer a formal written proposal lapsed, however, and the APJO became suspicious of Korchid’s proposal, as well as his connections with the investors of the 2002-2011 period. One interviewee mentioned that Korchid’s proposal is ‘like [the agreements between] Israel and Palestine because if Jemna can’t hold up one of its conditions,t he state could take it over. So it’s not really a partnership’ (Interview with APJO employee) At the time of writing, the community of Jemna is now considering the establishment of a UCPA. This decision was reached at a meeting one day prior to Ramadan, on May 25, 2017—with reservations. The government has yet to come back to the negotiating table. 
 Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 From the occupation of the date fields to the current standoff with the government, a number of people and parties supported the town of Jemna. At the outset, elders were seminal in encouraging the cooperative model. A number of interviewees reported that when the youth first occupied the town, they considered looting the equipment, partitioning and even burning the land and raising the French colonial-era buildings. The elders convinced the youth to maintain the infrastructure and keep the plantation’s date trees. Upon seizing the date farm, locals who worked on the land offered the movement the information necessary to maintain and improve the infrastructure and date trees. 
 Once the APJO was established, donations from around the region, the country, and France helped the town to refinance and refurbish its equipment for the first, 2011, harvest. 
 Deputies of Al Irada, Attayar and Ennahdha supported Jemna with site visits. Hamma Hammai, spokesperson for the Popular Front and Abdellatif Mekki, Ennahdha deputy and former Minister of Public Health, were present at the October auction to informally lend support to the process (Tarfa, 2016). Nizar Snoussi (also a Speaker for the Defense of Chokri Belaid) assembled a team of lawyers and provided pro bono counsel.

 During the occupation phase in which members of the League for the Protection of the Revolution, among others, sat in and established an encampment in Jemna, a ‘tent city’ was constructed with posts for communications, logistics, and information collection. Decisions were reached by consensus of the activists present. 
 The establishment of the APJO was likewise reached by consensus from the people of Jemna. Initially, the elders sought to establish a  Sociétés de Mise en Valeur  (development company), which would involve cooperation with one of Tunisia’s large banks in both assessing the value of the land and its yields, as well as splitting the profits between the bank, investors, and the community. The youth were against this decision, and instead the association was founded based on the principles of the cooperative model. 
 Once the APJO was established, the association would take its directives by consensus or elections, where overwhelming consensus was not evident. The APJO board consists of 11 members, including a president and secretary general. Meetings were announced by loudspeaker from a vehicle that drove through the community. Following opening remarks by the APJO president, Taher Etahri, the floor would open to any member of the community wishing to voice his/her opinion. Proposals would then be announced, followed by a vote—if overwhelming consensus was not reached (for a video documenting one of the town meetings see Szakal, 2016). 
 The influence and effects of Jemna’s conflict with the government have yet to be felt nationally. While it is a well-known case among environmentalists, academics, and journalists who focus on food sovereignty and issues of local autonomy, few Tunisians are aware of the goings on in this small oasis town in the south of the country. With that said, the hash tag ‘#Jemna’ is well populated, and more than a handful of articles are published about the case ( ECPDM , 2016) in Arabic, English, and French. For nearby oasis towns with similar land disputes (Tozeur, Zaafrane), Jemna represents the ongoing struggle over local resources and redistributive politics. 
 The immediate outcomes of Jemna’s occupation of its date fields  are , however, quite measurable. The rental costs that the state took in from 2002 to 2011 under the corrupt arrangement reached between the Ben Ali regime and the investors is estimated at 250,000 dinars. This pales in comparison to the 1.5 million dinars that the APJO made in its first five years of its operations (Hamouchene, 2017). With this sum, the APJO has paid its workers more than minimum wage, as well as establishing a workers’ pension account (in the absence of the state, which froze all accounts in 2016); financed the reconstruction, refurbishment or purchase of new equipment; constructed classrooms in two primary schools, a football field and a covered gym in a local high school, a covered souq [market] for dates; purchased an ambulance to operate throughout the region; established a centre for children with special needs, and donated to charities throughout the region.

 GovTrack.us scrapes public information and pieces it together to follow the voting process and record from the House of Representative and for the Senate’s website, the status of legislation in the Library of Congress’ THOMAS database (now the Congress.gov website), and the schedules of hearings to discuss the legislation among multiple committee websites. It homogenizes and unifies dispersed parts of government's involvement in the legislative process, and produces easy to follow, and track, creates information about bills and clauses within bills, voting records for House and Senate members, analysis on bill content and partisanship, and multiple ways for constituents to get in touch with their legislators for individual bills. 
 Origins and Development 
 After dealing with the comprehensive but cumbersome Congressional records THOMAS database that the US Library of Congress, Joshua Tauberer began to think of a more streamlined way to present legislative information to average citizens. He asked the Library of Congress to share its data in 2001, but they had refused for more than 10 years, because, as he puts it “the Library’s law division does not see publishing data as a part of its mandate authorized by Congress, and getting both the House and the Senate to agree on updating the Library’s mandate is slow going” (Tauberer 2014, Why I Built GovTrack.us). It wasn’t until 2016 that Congress implemented a new legislative data publication system (Tauberer, GovTrack now actually uses open government data 2016), at which point GovTrack switched off their bulk data functions to switch to other areas of concern, calling it a win for open government (GovTrack 2016). 
 Because multiple parts of the government intervene in the making of a bill, coordinating their cooperation was also going to be hard. So in 2004, while still trying to engage with the government to get them to push their data out, he coded a website called GovTrack.us (part of his Civic Impulse organization) that scraped public information together and pieced it together. 
 Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 GovTrack.us is a project of Civic Impulse, LLC, an independent entity which is wholly owned by its operator and receives no funding in any form from outside organizations. Operating costs are managed through Google's AdSense, ""which means in most cases we do not even know who is advertising on GovTrack at any given time"", and crowdfunding.[1] A 2015 Kickstarter campaign to fund the website outraised the desired 35,000 USD; 900 backers pledged $36,063.[2] In 2016 the website moved to Patreon for crowdfunding, and increased its operating budget by about 33%.[3] It now operates on a monthly pledge system, where 389 patrons contribute $2,613 per month to GovTrack. 
 Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 Joshua Tauberer is a key figure in the Open Government movement that seeks to apply principles of open source data to government. GovTrack.us frames its mandate in four multifaceted ways: sunlight as a disinfectant, democratization of primary legal materials, informing policy decisions through demographic data, and building consumer products of open-government for non-policy-wonks (Tauberer 2014, Applications for Open Government). 
 The information, automatically webscraped, is not just collected, but harmonized with an easy to follow timeline, the bills and disputes over the issues are summarized and explained while the original text is presented for anyone to scrutinize. In 2008 Tauberer won a contest for making it a staple of his website to link bills to Technorati blog posts discussing them (Technorati 2008) to contextualize what the political discussion around policy decisions in a way that increases accessibility and understanding for citizens with different levels of political engagement. As the project has grown it now produces its own content, though it still links to reputable news sources throughout its summaries. This reflects the open government ethos of “building something” (Tauberer 2014, Visualizing Metro Ridership) by transforming data that has been standardized into something new that provides useful insight; it also reflects the open source logic of building new layers of infrastructure on old ones (Larkin 2013). 
 Major Projects and Events 
 GovTrack contexualizes Congress members’ decision to bring a bill to the floor or to support it by mapping aggregating voting records and bibliographical information to infer their left-right ideology compared to members using principle components statistical analysis. It also uses text analysis to track changes to bills and follow ideas and proposals that travel between bills, or deletions of fragments. This is valuable because the US legislative amendments process allows Congress to use misleading titles or to attach unpopular ideas to popular bills. By keeping track of the process, GovTrack produces information that can be used to keep representatives accountable. 
 Using their legislation tracing mechanism, email and twitter alerts for updates on specific bills can be deployed, which are made easy to subscribe to depending on the user’s particular policy interests. By presenting the information in platforms that allow for easy sharing, GovTrack can help initiate a conversation between citizens about policy questions. 
 An additional link redirects to a project under the Civic Impulse umbrella called Phone Congress creates a short text for you to read while calling your representative or senator, who is identified by your residence location and whose phone number is provided to you, as well as some pointers for additional comments you might like to make. 
 Publications 
 A 2017 report highlights developments in GovTrack since the 2015 fundraising campaing, which includes the hiring of a staff writer and communications manager, who have produced 239 original articles for GovTrack, and the development of a tool which tracks clauses within bills and visualizes how these get adopted and attached to other bills that have a higher likelyhood of passing.[4]

Its mission is to use art and technology to educate youth about democracy. More specifically the organization seeks to increase youth voter turnout, increase youth engagement in their communities, and to promote dialogue between youth and elected officials.  Alongside its year-round activities, the organization conducts youth mobilization campaigns during federal, provincial, and municipal elections. The organization has several unique characteristics. Its work targets youth between the ages of 18 and 35 – those who are eligible to vote, but are no longer at school and less likely to live with a parent. Apathy is Boring also focuses its efforts on youth who are not currently engaged in the democratic process, be it as voters or by other means. This distinguishes its work from other organizations that work through schools or focus exclusively on young leaders. The organization relies heavily on research from the social sciences to inform the structure of its programs, and also conducts its own research.[1] In the past, Apathy is Boring has conducted studies on behalf of Elections Canada looking at electoral accessibility as well as youth.[2][3]  Origins and Development  Apathy is Boring began in January 2004 when founders, Ilona Dougherty, Paul Shore, and Mackenzie Duncan saw that many of their peers felt disengaged from the political process. When the 2004 Canadian Federal Election was called, work began on what would be A is B’s first federal “Get out the Youth Vote” campaign. Using a website, digital media technology, concerts, and a media outreach campaign, A is B was able to reach over 500,000 young people in Canada in less than four months. Following this successful campaign, the founders of A is B began to build their vision into an organization which included local events such as “The Civic Duty Concerts” in Montreal which featured acclaimed Canadian artists such as Euphrates, K'naan, Tumi and the Volume, Taima and Chris Brown and Kate Fenner. A Is B has continued with its mission by organizing concerts and events, creating a clothing line, making public service announcements that were shown in theatres.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  A is B has grown to have a full-time staff in eight cities across Canada. Their board of directors is also made up of influential community members from coast to coast. In addition, they have developed an online presence on  social media  platforms that attracts hundreds of active supporters and volunteers.  Apathy is Boring receives funding from the following revenue streams:Foundations and government grants  Donations  Consulting revenue  Workshops and presentations  In 2008, Her Excellency, the Right Honourable Michaëlle Jean, Governor General of Canada, became A is B’s organizational patron.Specializations, Methods and Tools  Apathy is Boring employs a number of different participatory methods and tools to engage youth. While many of their programmes are focused on  civic education  and  community organizing , some methods are specific to the goal of each project:VOTE Program : Works to increase youth voter turnout rates through information and mobilization campaigns in federal, provincial and municipal elections. They also conduct research projects focused on improving youth mobilization tactics.[4]RISE Program  : An initiative under Canada Service Corps, RISE is designed to help young people find ways to co-create community projects and contribute in strengthening our civic and democratic fabric by engaging on topics that interest them.[5] RISE hubs are currently operating in Vancouver, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Halifax.Youth-Friendly Program:  Gives civil society and government the concrete tools they need to engage youth in decision-making, through  workshops , organizational audits and other resources to support organizations as they reach out to and engage young people aged 18-30 in decision making.[6]Workshops and presentations:  Conducts a variety of educational workshops targeted at both youth and those who want to work with youth. The workshops cover a range of topics based on outreach to youth.AisB also makes use of information and communication technology to get in touch with and involve youth and those interested in working with younger demographics. Uses of  ICT  include the website  apathyisboring.com ;  social media  including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram; and Citizen Factory.  Major Projects and EventsIn 2005, A is B launched  www.youthfriendly.com  in partnership with the Department of Canadian Heritage to offer youth friendly workshops for “adult” organizations who want to better engage youth in their work.  In the fall 2007, A is B testified in front of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Procedures and House Affairs about changes to the Elections Act.  In 2008, A is B completed its concert series “Every Party Should Be Democratic” in conjunction with its third Canadian federal election outreach campaign. In addition to two Youth Dialogues with the Governor General of Canada, A is B co-produced a series of four concerts, featuring well-known Canadian artists Hedley, ill Scarlett, Theo Tams, K'naan, and Jully Black, among others. A is B also produced a PSA that aired on MuchMusic Television, advertised in free weeklies in every major Canadian city, and undertook an online campaign “Democracy is More than Voting”, urging youth to make an informed decision in the fall 2008 Canadian federal election.  The 150 Years Young (2016-17): 150 YY project brought together community partners and 12 City Ambassadors (representing Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver) to tell stories about youth in Canada through creative installations and dialogue - both online and offline.  #5MMV Canadian Federal Election Campaign (2015): The #5MMV campaign was online/offline campaign to engage young people in the 2015 Canadian federal election. Street Teams attended concerts from coast to coast, handing out election resources and answering questions their peers had about when, where and how to vote.  From 2014-2018, a partnership between Apathy is Boring and Elections Alberta worked to increase voter turnout in the province through community workshops and a registration drive.  In 2018, the RISE program was launched in Edmonton, Montreal and Ottawa giving 19 youth ambassadors opportunities to develop community impact projects around the topic of social inclusion. A hub in Toronto was added for Cohort II in the Fall of 2018.  In 2019, RISE focused on the issue of the environment. Vancouver is added as a fifth hub for Cohort IV.  Apathy is Boring mobilized youth voters in the spring of 2019 for the Alberta election and in the fall for the Canadian federal election. Their campaign reached more than 2-million young Canadians across their social media platforms.  In 2020, RISE expanded once again with hubs now in Winnipeg and Halifax.  Youth-Friendly Audits: Provides in-depth analysis of an organization’s youth engagement practices and offers concrete next steps to improve and build on current practices. Youth-Friendly Audit clients included the Canadian Red Cross, the National Association of Friendship Centres (NAFC) and several municipalities in Ontario.  Apathyisboring.com: Provides youth with information, ""how-to's"", and support to get involved in democracy.  Citizen Factory: Online resource for Canadian youth that aggregates Parliamentary information and condenses it, making it easier for youth to understand how the Canadian Government works. Citizen Factory also includes resources for teachers to help engage youth in Canada’s democratic process, including a set of lesson plans that are structured to help bring the online content of Citizen Factory into the classroom.Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

Please help us veryify its content.Mission and Purpose 
 The Malawi Human Rights Youth Network (MHRYN) is a secretariat for 68 youth organizations throughout Malawi. MHRYN mobilizes funding, coordinates, and builds the capacity of these member organizations. MHRYN’s vision is to achieve “an environment where youth and children are empowered and participate in issues that affect them and are able to contribute positively to the socio-economic and political development of country.” MHRYN strives to respond to these challenges through various projects. 
 Origins and Development 
 MHRYN was founded in 2001 in response to the various challenges that inhibit the growth of youth participation in Malawi. According to Program Officer Hastings Saka, voter apathy was, and continues to be one of these challenges. In talking about this issue, Mr. Saka stated that MHRYN research found that many young people hold the perspective that “we don’t see the need in showing up [to elections], voting for someone who is not there for us, who actually prioritizes his special interests or political party interests at the expense of development initiatives.” Another major issue inhibiting youth participation is what Mr. Saka termed “the big man theory”. Explaining this, he stated that for young people, the expectation in Malawian society is that “whatever an elderly person has said, you cannot dispute that.” He elaborated, “Young people are just like objects. Things are being made for them, decisions are being made for them but they are not involved. They are not effectively participating. Where they have been involved, it’s like maybe they have just been invited to a meeting but they are not empowered to speak and they are not given affirmative actions to make sure that their views are aired out.” Through the implementation of projects to combat the aforementioned challenges, MHRYN has successfully increased its membership to become the largest youth organization in Malawi today. 
 Organization Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 National Coordinator Ronnie Phiri leads MHRYN, which has a overall staff of 10 people. It receives funding from multiple sources, including National Democratic Institute, United Nations Development Programme, etc. The organization is always searching for more funding. 
 Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 In an effort to establish “an environment where youth and children are empowered and participate in issues that affect them and are able to contribute positively to the socio-economic and political development of country”, MHRYN implements budget tracking/accountability clubs throughout Malawi. Created after the national elections of 2014, these projects were created so that youth can track the expenditure of government officials. As stated by Mr. Saka, “they should be able to track the utilization of the resources because that’s their money...not the government’s.” In order to select participants, MHRYN and/or member organizations work with local chiefs to identify capable young people. After this, MHRYN trains the young people in how to monitor government spending/budgeting, as well as provides the accountability clubs with the data they need to effectively monitor and evaluate civil sector employees. As Mr. Saka stated, “time and again we are at loggerheads with district councillors because we have presented out something which they have covered [up]...there’s a lot of financial mismanagement.” Regardless, positive changes have been seen as a result of these budget tracking/accountability clubs. For example, Mr. Saka told me that corruption and/or mismanagement is rampant during the construction of primary school blocks in Malawi, which involves coordination between local elites and local government. He described how much of the time, money either goes missing or the school block is poorly built/unfinished. Following the intervention of the budget tacking/accountability clubs, however, several schools have been completed due to community pressure. Explaining the success of this project, Mr. Saka stated that, “in a way, we have tried to create an interface or a forum where a member of parliament can meet the citizens and explain things as they are.” 
 MHRYN also fulfills its role as a Secretariat for 68 youth organizations across Malawi by organizing an Annual General Assembly during which all member organizations gather in Lilongwe to discuss past and future activities. 
 Major projects and events 
 MHRYN implements projects in four programmatic areas. They are: Governance and Human Rights, Climate Change and Environmental Management, Health and HIV/AIDS, and Child/Youth Empowerment. For example, with funding from the United Nations Democracy Fund (UNDEF), MHRYN implements the National Youth Local Governance Internship Program. Here, eighty youth (40 men and 40 women) from member youth organizations gained internships within Malawian city and district councils for one month, with the hope of empowering them to “effectively participate in local governance issues from the grassroots level.” Mr. Saka proudly stated that, although it was difficult to establish due to government scepticism, “it was the first of its kind in Malawi”. Mr. Saka believed it was of critical importance due to his belief that “part of empowerment is that these young people should be aware of local governance structures, their laws and the processes and the systems”.

Debates usually take place in the preliminary stages of drafting a project and make use of a number of deliberative tools to engage the public including:The dissemination of technical documentation  Testimony and meetings with experts and scientists  Thematic forums, dialogues or other forms of discussion among citizensThe use of the Internet and new information technologiesPublic Debates are mandatory for works that exceed 50 million euros. Below this threshold, it is up to the Authority to evaluate the project and determine whether it mandates a public consultation. A Debate can not be held on issues which fall under the Regional Law 62 of 2007 (""Regional Referendum Framework provided for by the Constitution and by the Statute"") which determines a  referendum  sufficient public consultation.Support for Local Participatory ProcessesChapter III of the Regional Participation Law (46, 2013) calls for the economic supports of local participatory processes approved by the Authority for the Promotion of Participation. The APP's evaluation is based on several conditions and requirements. In particular, the relevant bodies or officials must agree to take the outcome of the participatory process into account in their final decision or else to adequately and publicly justify the reasons for the failure or partial acceptance of the results. As well, the participatory process must have a specific topic or well-defined scope and be held for a maximum of six months. Appropriate methods and tools must be used to ensure maximum inclusiveness and the expression of all points of view (within reason).[2]  Major Projects and Events  To date, the Authority has approved three public debates:Public debate on the planned development of the Port of Livorno (2015)Public debate on the Florence Airport (2014-2015)Public debate on the restoration of mining activities in Gavorrano (2016)As well, the Authority has approved Regional funding and support for 59 local participatory processes.[3]  Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

Please help usverify its content. Mission and Purpose  The Participatieraad (participation council) is a permanent institution that has been set up by the municipality of Haarlem, in the Netherlands, to give solicited and unsolicited advice to the municipal council.  Its aim is to make sure that the opinions and interests of all citizens are heard and taken into account in the formulation of policy, including those from groups which are traditionally less able to find their way through the bureaucracy of local politics.  Specifically, the Participatieraad effectively institutionalizes citizen participation in three ‘domains’ of municipal policy:Healthcare, housing and wellbeing  Work and income  Diversity and the multicultural societyTo this end, the council consists of 15 people roughly representative of the population of the city on a number of characteristics, and aims to actively engage additional citizens who are directly affected by the particular policy under discussion at any given time. This points to a second purpose of the Participatieraad: to ensure its members represent the general population of Haarlem and to encourage them to reach out to more people where-ever this is appropriate.  Origins and Development  A far-going decentralization of welfare provision from the national to the municipal level has been going on in the Netherlands since 2010. Starting from 2015, municipalities will become responsible for child and youth care, assistance to the unemployed (and the provision of benefits), and care for structurally ill and elderly people. In light of these changes, the municipality of Haarlem has stated the aim of expanding and modernizing the possibilities for citizen participation in policy making in its program for the 2011-2015 period.  At the time, three advisory councils already existed, with experts and stakeholders in the respective fields of social issues, health care, and urban diversity. The Participatieraad combines these three councils and broadens its inclusiveness. The process of forming the Participatieraad has been directed as much as possible by these three organizations. To this end, an agreement was made in September 2011 that the councils would come with a proposal in September 2012. This proposal led, through some discussions back and forth, to an ordinance with which the municipal council agreed in June 2013. The Participation council was officially installed on the 24th of September 2013.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The Participatieraad was founded by the municipality of Haarlem and its three older advisory councils. Although the council is supposed to be fully independent, it is financed fully by the municipality of Haarlem.  The budget of the Participatieraad (as determined by the municipality in its decision to support its founding) is as follows:Compensations council members (15 members, 10 yearly meetings): €16.000  Compensation chair: €4.000  Particpation-award: €5.000  Other costs for organizing meetings, consulting experts, research, organizational costs, recruitment of new members: €30.410  Total: €55.410In addition, the municipality has reserved €13.000 in its own budget for support of the Participatieraad.  Membership of the Participatieraad needs to fulfill two criteria:Be representative of the general population of Haarlem regarding: origin, gender, age, illness-status, employment-status, and other relevant characteristics.  Be fairly distributed in primary interest across the aforementioned three focus areas.In addition, they need to reside within the municipality of Haarlem, and cannot have any direct business ties with the municipality be employed by the municipality, or hold any representative position.  Members are recruited in a process which starts with a campaign in the local media to encourage applications. A recruitment committee reviews the applicants and selects the new members. This committee consists of the chair and two members of the Participatieraad, plus a representative of the municipality. Members are selected for a period of at most four years, and can participate for a maximum of two terms. Members can at any point decide themselves to leave the Participatieraad, and are forced to do so if they move out of the municipality. The Participatieraad will try to replace its members gradually, rather than all at once, to ensure continuity.  During the first selection process, in Summer 2013, members of the three former advisory councils replaced the (as of then not yet existing) members of the Participatieraad in the recruitment committee.  Specializations, Methods, and Tools  The Participatieraad offers solicited and unsolicited advice to the municipality council on current issues and policy within the three focus areas of healthcare, housing and wellbeing; work and income; and diversity and urban multiculturalism.  The Participatieraad organizes monthly public meetings (excluding the summer months July and August). These meetings are held on the first Tuesday of every month, and an effort is made to make them known to as many people as possible. To give an indication, in the February 2014 meeting 140 participants joined in. These people are obviously self-selected though.  While priorities are discussed during the monthly meetings, advice is developed over a longer stretch of time. The Participatieraad tries to involve many people, stakeholders, experts and affected citizens, in the formulation of their advice. Depending on the issue at hand, this can take the form of collecting the experience of other citizens with services offered or regulated by the municipality, or conversely, the municipal council can ask the Participatieraad to assess whether information or services provided by them are sufficiently accessible and intelligible for all citizens.  The Participatieraad also organizes an annual Participation Award: an award for the initiative or project that contributes most to the creation of a more open and tolerant society and which stimulates citizens to be an active part of it.  The Participatieraad has largely succeeded in generating enough public interest to function as a more open and inclusive advisory council. Hard data on the demographic of the citizens involved in the work of the Participatieraad is, besides for the 15 members, not available. It is therefore unclear whether the citizens involved with the Participatieraad are representative of the wider population. Although this is strictly enforced for the council itself, other citizens who are involved by coming to the monthly meetings or giving their input and suggestions are self-selected. On the other hand, some within the municipality have formulated concerns that the focus on representativeness applied to the Participatieraad might lead to a decline in specific expertise applied to the advice given, as compared to the previous expert-dominated and policy-area specific advisory councils. There is therefore a perceived tension between the dual aims of providing expert advice and providing a forum for inclusiveness and citizen participation.  Major Projects and Events  During the last three months of its first year of existence (2013), the Participatieraad formulated four pieces of advice to the municipality. These have ranged from relatively large and abstract (the transition in youth care taken place these years), to concrete and specific (the public transport taxi).

Please help us verify its content.Mission and Purpose  The Constitution Unit conducts independent research into constitutional change and the reform of political institutions. The Unit’s seeks to make real-world impact with its research, informing policy-makers engaged in such changes – both in the United Kingdom and around the world.  Origins and Development  The Constitution Unit was created in 1995 to aid policy-makers involved in changing their constitutions. Constitutions change frequently. Roughly five national constitutions are completely rewritten every year, and another thirty are amended in some way. Many other changes take place without formal constitutional amendment, through shifts in constitutional conventions, judicial interpretation, or statute law. This is crucially important in the UK, which famously lacks a codified constitution. Matters such as the UK’s relationship with the European Union, the composition, powers and procedures of the two chambers of parliament, the mechanisms through which citizens can participate in politics, and the territorial nature of the United Kingdom all depend on political decisions, but have broader constitutional consequences.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The Unit is housed in University College London’s (UCL) Department of Political Science and, after more than 20 years, it continues to thrive. Professor Meg Russell, Director since 2015, leads research on parliament. The Deputy Director is Dr Alan Renwick, a specialist on elections and referendums. Professor Robert Hazell, though he has retired from the role of Director, continues to work on areas such as the judiciary and the civil service. The Unit is also home to several other researchers and PhD students.  Specializations and Activities  Robert Hazell founded the Unit initially to conduct detailed research and planning on constitutional reform in the UK. While continuing to fulfil that remit, the Unit has branched out its activities, assessing the effects of reforms that have taken place, and researching constitutional and political arrangements beyond the UK. One of the main goals of the Unit is to provide provide timely evidence to policy-makers which has had substantial real-world impact.  One of the Unit’s major focus is the mobilization and creation of knowledge. Housed in the University College London, the Unit frequently collaborates with scholars and practitioners all over the world, drawn from politics, law and the public service. The Unit plays host to visiting researchers, public servants taking research breaks, and others working as volunteers.  Knowledge translation and public education are two further activities of the Unit. Information on their research is made available through their  blog , a regular newsletter and a variety of  events  including lectures, seminars, and conferences. The website contains links to their  reports , free and open to the public.  Major Projects and Events  Two of the most recent projects undertaken by the the Constitutional Unit are the  Citizens’ Assembly on Brexit , the  Independent Commission on Referendums , and a research project on  Improving Discourse During Election and Referendum Campaigns .Publications  The Unit’s publications include reports, books, and articles in both academic journals and mainstream media. They also publish a blog which contains timely information on UK politics and the Unit’s work.  See AlsoCitizens' Assembly on Brexit  (case)References  Northern Ireland Border Poll.

YOP works with a team of passionate, committed and experienced development facilitators (national and international) with diverse professional backgrounds (journalists, anthropologists, lawyers, social scientists, agricultural experts, youth counselors, researchers, accountants and development consultants).  In 2007, YOP started working strategically with municipalities. In 2008 and 2009, YOP, supported by the Welsh Assembly and Voluntary Services Overseas (VSO), develop a Youth Communication Strategy and a National Volunteering Scheme for councils. YOP works in partnership with the Northwest Regional Delegation of the Ministry of Youth and Civic Education, and several national and community development actors and organizations.  In 2009, YOP carried out a survey on youth participation in municipal activities with over 2,000 youth from five municipalities. Based on the results of the findings, YOP initiated the Advocacy for the Development and Implementation of Municipal Youth Policies. This led to the signing of five municipal policy frameworks, the development of seven Municipal Youth Action Plans, and the adoption of three municipal youth policies. Presently, YOP is strengthening the capacities of youth leaders to advocate for the implementation of youth policies in Northwest Cameroon.

 WECAN’s public mission statement is: 
 The Women’s Earth and Climate Action Network (WECAN) International is a climate justice-based initiative established to unite women worldwide as powerful stakeholders in sustainability solutions, policy advocacy, and worldwide movement building for social and ecologic justice. 
 WECAN International engages women grassroots activists, Indigenous and business leaders, scientists, policy makers, farmers, academics and culture-shapers in collaboration with the goal of stopping the escalation of climate change and environmental and community degradation, while accelerating the implementation of just climate solutions through women’s empowerment, advocacy at international policy forums, trainings, on-the-ground projects, advocacy campaigns, and political, economic, social and environmental action.  [i]Origins and Development 
 WECAN International was established in 2013. It was originally developed as an initiative of the Women’s Earth and Climate Caucus (WECC), which is a non-profit organization based in the San Francisco Bay Area, California. WECAN International was developed at the 2013 WECC International Women’s Earth and Climate Summit. This summit brought together more than 100 women leaders from around the globe who were looking to collaborate on climate change solutions. At the summit, it became clear that there was a need for a long-term, diverse mechanism for women’s climate justice. This was how WECAN International was born. [i]Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 WECAN International was founded by Osprey Orielle Lake. Lake continues to be the Executive Director of WECAN International. Daily operations are run by the WECAN team, who are paid staff. WECAN has a U.S. Women’s Climate Justice Initiative Steering Committee that helps with decision making. In addition, WECAN International has an Advisory Council that helps provide overall vision. Notable members of the WECAN International Advisory Council include Jane Goodall, Naomi Klein, Dr. Vandana Shiva, Melina Laboucan-Massimo, and Larry Schewiger. [i]WECAN International has a strong network of volunteers and interns who work alongside paid staff. 
 Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 WECAN International specializes in participatory approaches involving women. WECAN is dedicated to ensuring women are at the forefront of all action to address the global climate crisis. Women are more adversely impacted by climate change and environmental degradation because of historic and continuing impacts of gender inequity and reliance on natural resources for survival.Women are also indispensable actors and leaders of just and effective solutions for climate change. WECAN International is part of an international people’s movement that demands revolutionary change and protests climate destruction. All work completed by WECAN focuses on empowering women.  [i]Direct Action -  http://wecaninternational.org/pages/direct-actionWomen’s CJ Online Course -  http://wecaninternational.org/pages/climate-trainings-homepageMajor Projects and Events 
 WECAN International has worked on numerous projects. A complete list of WECAN International projects can be found  here . Below is a sample of some of their major projects: WECAN Regional Climate Solutions TrainingThis project provides both online and on-the-ground climate solution training. It focuses on creating place-based actions plans to address local socio-ecological need, develop climate solutions, and support women in their role as key environmental stakeholders. The project offers inspiration and a new framework for collaborative efforts. Women for Forests and Fossil Fuel/Mining/Mega-Dam ResistanceThis project aims to support a diverse constituency of international women to rise up and help protect forests. Additionally, the program aims to reduce, prevent, and shut down resource extractive industries. The program currently has three primary focuses: Amazon rainforest, Congo rainforest, and Tongass rainforest. 
 The project was started to address concerns surrounding the high rate of deforestation that is occuring in the three primary focus areas. Additionally, the project is exploring the environmental impact of rapid deforestation. Consequences such as increased greenhouse gas emissions and reduced carbon sequestration are primary concerns.

 “ We are women and girls from every corner of the planet building a lifestyle revolution to fight the climate crisis .” [i]1 Million Women is Australia’s largest women’s movement acting on climate change. The 1 Million Women mission is to reach and inspire 1 million women and girls to save carbon by cutting waste and pollution from their daily lives, and empowering them to become agents for change within their own households and communities. The 1 Million Women purpose is simple; the more women engaged, the more carbon saved, the bigger the collective impact on the devastating effects of climate change. [ii]Origins and Development 
 1 Million Women was founded in 2009, by Natalie Isaacs. Natalie was a former cosmetic manufacturer whose life focused on packaging. Inspired to change consumption and tackle the climate change crisis, Natalie realized that everything single thing we do shapes the world we live in. [iii]  She decided to focus on individuals as a way to tackle the climate crisis. 1 Million Women is now the largest women’s environmental organization in Australia, with over 83,000 women having joined the campaign. The goal of the campaign is to cut 100,000 tonnes of carbon pollution. [iv]Organization Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 1 Million Women is run by 7 team members. Natalie Isaacs, the original founder, remains the CEO of 1 Million Women. [v]  1 Million Women also has a number of team ambassadors who reach out to women around the world to get involved in the organization. [vi]Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 1 Million Women specializes in helping its members conserve energy, and cut waste and pollution. The goal of each campaign is to have members cut carbon pollution. The overall goal of the organization is to cut 100,000 tonnes of carbon pollution yearly. [vii]Major Projects and Events 
 1 Million Women has spearheaded numerous campaigns to reduce carbon pollution. Below is a sample of their campaigns: Leave it on the ShelfThis is a pledge campaign to show supermarkets that consumers do not approve of excessive packaging on fruit and vegetables. By signing the pledge, participants pledge that they will leave overly packaged fruit and vegetables on the shelf and choose to purchase products that are not packaged in plastic. Less Meat More BeansThis is a pledge campaign to eat less meat and more beans in order to lower animal agricultural impacts on the planet. Livestock production accounts for large amounts of GHGs. By signing the pledge, participants agree to eat more plant-based foods in order to reduce global emissions of animal agriculture.

The goal of the organization is to tackle climate justice issues in three main areas: Human Rights and Climate Change, Women’s Leadership on Gender and Climate Change, and Future Generations. The majority of their work takes placein G40 cities and countries that do not have a large impact on climate change. The organization has completed a number of successful projects and continues to make a significant impact on climate justice for many individuals around the world. [iii]The Mary Robinson Foundation’s mission statement is:To put justice and equity at the heart of responses to climate change, particularly those concerned with how best to respond and adapt to the challenge that it poses for the poorest and most vulnerable peoples of the world  To empower poor and vulnerable communities to speak directly in a way that is effectively heard both about the negative impact of climate change on their ways of life, about its potential for conflict, and about what ought to be done by way of a response, in terms of fairness and justice  To facilitate a hearing for such communities to be able to voice their concerns about the negative impact of responses to climate change which are too rooted in technology and as a result insensitive to time and place  To help shape an international framework which minimizes the negative impact which climate change is having on poor communities around the world  To imprint on future generations, of leaders in this field and in society generally, a strong sense of the inter-connectedness of climate change with issues of development and social justice through the promotion of a strong human rights dimension to university learning and education on climate change  To build a shared space for information and knowledge-sharing on climate justice which is accessible to all and a source of solidarity for those concerned about climate change  To catalyze the work of activists, individuals, groups and networks, to further the implementation of the Principles of Climate Justice  To promote the development of technologies that result in sustainable development and promote a better quality of life among the poor and vulnerable [i]Origins and Development  The Mary Robinson Foundation for Climate Justice was founded in 2010 by Mary Robinson. Mary Robinson, the first female President of Ireland, was in power from 1990-1997. She was also the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights from 1997-2002. During her time with the UN and as the president of Ireland, Mary was deeply affected by the extensive suffering she witnessed around the world, especially that of women. She took an interest in climate change because of the impact it had on people. Determined to dedicate resources to combat climate justice issues, Mary Robinson established the Mary Robinson Foundation for Climate Justice on February 8th, 2010 under the Innovation Alliance of Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin. Both Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin generously supported the Mary Robinson Foundation for Climate Justice with significant donations. [ii]Today, the Foundation is based in Ireland but works globally to tackle climate justice issues.The organization has completed a number of successful projects and has made a significant impact on climate justice in many countries. Their work typically focusses on G40 countries which do have a comparatively smaller impact on climate change. Mary Robinson continues to act as the president of the organization. [iii]Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The Mary Robinson Foundation for Climate Justice is run by a board of trustees, with a CEO. Mary Robinson, as acting president of the organization, provides visionary leadership for the organization. The organization’s board of trustees and CEO are responsible for decision making. In addition to the CEO and board of trustees, the Mary Robinson Foundation has an International Advisory Council which has extensive international expertise and experience. They are available to provide guidance to the CEO and board of trustees. [iv]The organization pays its employees. It is a non-profit organization that is funded by a variety of organizations and donors. The initial funding for the organization was supplied by Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin. Today, the organization is sustained through government funding, donors, and investments. Financial decisions are managed in a top-down way, with all decisions made through the CEO and the board of directors.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The Mary Robinson Foundation takes a participatory approach to much of their work surrounding climate justice. They focus their work in three main areas: Human Rights and Climate Change, Women’s Leadership on Gender and Climate Change, and Future Generations. Within each of these categories, the Mary Robinson Foundation uses a three-prong participatory approach: Leadership, Bridging, and Convening. This method allows the organization to use its unique position among civil society and policy makers to bring a participatory approach to stakeholder engagement to promote climate justice.Leadership  :The Mary Robinson Foundation has established itself as a thought leader (or an informed opinion leader in their specific field) on climate justice. The organization continues to be on the cutting edge of development in the field of climate justice. [v]Bridging  :The Mary Robinson Foundation builds bridges between people and disciplines. For example, the Mary Robinson Foundation worksto connect grassroots women lead initiatives with policy makers and world leaders. These connections directly convene and amplify the voices of the vulnerable. While other organizations in similar positions use a siloed approach (keeping experts and those within the process separate), the Mary Robinson Foundation works the opposite way. It strives to build bridges between the experts and those who are part of the process. [vi]Convening  :Mary Robinson is the organization’s largest convening power. Mary Robinson’s platform and international recognition allows the organization to bring a number of actors together. This is one of the organizations largest strengths. For example, they are able to convene the UN, government, and civil society partners on cases. On addition, the Mary Robinson Foundation always emphasize gender balance during convening processes.  [vii]In addition to using a Leadership, Bridging, and Convening approach, the Mary Robinson Foundation uses the Principles of Climate Justice to guide their decision making. [viii]  The Principles of Climate Justice demands a “leave no one behind” approach and seeks to ensure a human-centered approach that safeguards the rights of the most vulnerable . The Principles of Climate Justice are: Support the Right to Development, Share Benefits and Burdens of Equitably, Ensure the Decisions on Climate Change are Participatory, Transparent, and Accountable, Highlight Gender Equality and Equity, Harness the Transformative Power of Education and Climate Stewardship, and Use Effective Partnerships to Secure Climate Justice. [ix]Major Projects and Events  The Mary Robinson Foundation has initiated a number of participatory projects around the world. The organization categorizes their work into two main areas – case studies and special projects. Below are a few examples of their case study work. These cases focus on people centered climate action and climate justice.1.Women’s Participation – An Enabler of Climate JusticeThis project was a case study that focused on El Salvador, Chile and Vietnam. The project created a policy brief that demonstrated the positive impacts of women’s participation on the design, planning, and implementation of climate policy and in doing so, highlighted the benefits of supporting women’s participation in gender-responsive climate change.  2.  Women’s Land Rights in a Changing Climate: a case study from Maradi, NigerThe project was a case study in Maradi, Niger. The organization worked with women in the region to identify ways to improve local livestock and crop diversity and improve soil and water management. Additionally, the organization helped women in the region pool financial and labour resources.  3.  The Right to Food Security in a Changing Arctic (Canada)This project took place in Canada, Greenland, Alaska and Russia. Arctic regions are facing major changes to food security for the 160,000 indigenous Inuit due to rapidly changing climate and economic situations. This project worked with communities in all four Arctic regions to identify ways to create better food security.  In addition to case study projects, the Mary Robinson Foundation takes on special projects, such as conferences, to further facilitate participatory events. Below are a few examples of these events:Hunger, Nutrition Climate Justice – ConferenceThe Many Faces of Climate Justice: Exploring the Principles of Climate Justice – ConferencePublications  The Mary Robinson Foundation for Climate Justice produces numerous publications including policy papers, research articles, case studies, and briefings.

 The City of Ottawa has a broader mission and purpose, but the following vision statement captures the public engagement strategy: A City where public engagement is valued as an important part of the decision-making process and is inclusive, meaningful, accountable, and responsive to the public’s perspectives and needs. 
 The City has identified seven guiding principles: Accountable: Provide residents, stakeholders and community partners with information on how their public engagement feedback was considered and adopted, or why it was not adopted. 
 Inclusive: Plan and implement engagement activities that are accessible and respond to the needs of all residents, stakeholders and community partners and that remove potential barriers to participation. 
 Open, Informative and Transparent: Provide clear, relevant and complete information, in plainlanguage at the start and throughout the public engagement process and communicate the purpose, expectations and limitations clearly. 
 Timely: Ensure that public engagement is conducted in a well-timed manner, providing sufficient time for soliciting input, and for reporting back on how the input was used. 
 Adaptive: Ensure that the engagement plan is well tailored to the nature of the topic being discussed and flexible enough to be modified during the public engagement process, as needed. 
 Continuously Improving: Evaluate each public engagement initiative by seeking input fromparticipants about the process and the content. Evaluate on an ongoing basis in order to improve the quality of the public engagement process over time. 
 Co-operative: Build and maintain positive, respectful, and co-operative relationships with residents, stakeholders and community partners in order to increase the effectiveness of public engagement. Origins and Development 
 The City of Ottawa was founded in 1850 under the name Bytown and has conducted public engagement activities for many years. 
 In 2003, a ""Public Participation Policy"" was approved by Council and consisted of ""core values"" and""key principles"" as opposed to a specific policy. Under this policy there were both successful and less successful events which prompted the City to identify the need for a Public Engagement Strategy in its 2011-14 Strategic Plan. 
 However, it was not until 2013 that the City decided to systematize their approach. The City organized a series of public consultations and produced a City of Ottawa Public Engagement Strategy. 
 Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 The Public Engagement efforts are housed out of the Service Innovation and Performance Department which is funded out of the City general revenues. The City of Ottawa derives its income from three sources: Property Tax Levy, User Fees, and Grants and Subsidies. Budgeting for consultation is assigned on a per-project basis but permanent city staff tend to be responsible. 
 The City of Ottawa’s public engagement function is decentralized with project consultations prepared and delivered by the relevant City Department (e.g. Transportation Planning, Parks and Facilities Planning). A Staff Toolkit was developed in 2013-14 by a Public Engagement Interdepartmental Staff Committee that provides staff with guidance and relevant information for conducting. 
 Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 City of Ottawa Public Engagement conducts hundreds of engagement events annually. Most of these events are small scale and involve the day-to-day infrastructure and planning functions of a typical Canadian municipality. A typical consultation consists of a survey, an invitation for direct feedback and oftentimes several consultation events. 
 There is no one way participants are selected by the City of Ottawa, with different consultations targeting different groups. The Equity and Inclusion policies of the City of Ottawa require specific consideration made for groups that have historically been marginalized in planning decisions. That said, most consultations are open to all residents of Ottawa. 
 Major Projects and Events 
 The City of Ottawa differentiates between public engagement for smaller-scale projects such as a playground replacement and major projects which in September 2018 were identified as: O-Train Confederation Line 
 Ottawa Art Gallary (OAG) Expansion and Arts Court Redevelopment 
 The Combined Sewage Storage Tunnel (CSST) 
 The Ottawa Central Library 
 Developing LeBreton Flats 
 Flora Footbridge

Please help us verify its content.Mission and Purpose  Fight for the Future works to keep censorship-free, fully private access to afforable internet, focusing on defeating American legislation that censors free expression through copyright restrictions (SOPA, PIPA bills of 2012), warrantless surveillance and excessive policing, and pushing for the FCC's regulatory support for net neutrality to support a level-playing field in access to online services and information.  Origins and Development  Fight for the Future began as a Committee on Political Education (COPE) for the Service Employees International Union , which has 2 million members.  The first Wayback Machine archive of their website focuses on healthcare and the 2004 US elections, comparing candidates (George W. Bush and John Kerry), until 2011, when Fight for the Future was established as a fully fledged non-profit with a focus on internet governance.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Fight for the Future is a non-profit which applies for grants and carries out fundraising to fund its operations, from individual and foundation donations. It also has a 501(c)3 Education Fund. Supporters of the Education fund include the Ford Foundation ($300,000)[1], Media Democracy Fund [2] [3] (unclear if their initial $300,000 grant was co-sponsored with or additionally matched by Ford[3], and whether the 2012 announced $759,000 additional grant came through in that amount [4]), the Wallace Global fund ($40,000 [5]), the Knight foundation (unspecified amount), the Open Society Foundations[6, unspecified amount], the State Infrastructure fund, CraigConnects and Ashoka.  The Education Fund IRS forms show the following changes in contributions:  from 2013-2014: $86,111  2014-2015: $312,034  2015-2016: $796,734 + $367,361 from other sources of revenue, and a significant uptick in fundraising expenses in this period, up 81,502 from 17,472 from 2014-2015 and dropping to 45,691 in 2016-17  2016-2017: $726,448 in contribution income.  Other sources of reporting[7] indicate there is a the $1.5 million operating budget from donations from the Ford Foundation, the Knight Foundation, DuckDuckGo ($25,000), Yelp ($10,000), and venture capitalists, but it is unclear whether this is separate from the Education Fund, given the organization's own IRS filings' differences[8]. The non-education fund also received donations from the Shuttleworth Foundation [9], Sonos (amount unspecified), Voqal (amount unspecified), and the Proteus foundation (amount unspecified). FIght for the Future also has lists of donations depending on their size: 3 of at least $10K, 9 of at least $5,000, and 28 people/couples, organizations or companies who have donated at least $1,000; 4 organizations or companies also do secondary fundraising campaigns on behalf of the organization.  Fight for the Future also encourages its supporters to sign up for a Virtual Private Network (VPN). Some VPNs have affiliated with them by promising to donate 30 to 40% of any referral sign-ups back to Fight for the Future's anti-surveillance campaigns.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Fight for the Future has specialized in mobilizing online protests with internet users, small businesses and large tech corporations in order to pressure American legislators and regulators. Their repertoire of action consists on individual-on-corporate as well as individual and corporate pressure on regulatory and legislative anti-censorship and anti-surveillance measures, notably implementing widespread coordinated ""black outs"" where small and large websites stop providing their main service for a day and direct visitors to a petition.  Major Projects and Events  Highlights from the full timeline from 2011-2013Copyright  Fight for our Future began its mobilization against internet censorship by bringing attention to the Senate bill 978 in 2011, with a campaign called FreeBieber. The objective was to show that there was fair use value and commercial innovation to posting performance covers on YouTube instead of enforcing automated copyright.Major artists like Justin Bieber had been discovered after posting performances of song covers, and the campaign received national attention when it was discussed on the Colbert Report and was supported by the eponym himself. The campaign garnered 200,000 petition signatures and coverage on other news outlets and blogs, leading to the bill being dropped. Less than a month later, Fight for the Future focused attention on the House's Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) by calling November 16 the first American Censorship Day, and mobilized two millon petition signers and 84,000 calls to Congress were placed. To continue pressure, Fight for the Future rolled out its first Reddit campaign, where it asked individuals to pressure the GoDaddy webhosting company to come out against SOPA, which it achieved in under a week. It then followed up online mobilization with offline in-person meetings with Members of Congress. This made some senators begin to rescind their support for  PIPA  (Protect-IP Act), the upper-chamber version of SOPA.  Anti-SOPA and anti-PIPA mobilization 2012 reached its height with the January 18 internet blackout, where large and small websites  posted a banner  and made all their other content unavailable in order to direct internet users' attention to the bills, and to mobilize them into contacting Congress. The bipartisan PIPA  bill lost more Republican support  than Democrat among co-sponsors once the Heritage Foundation announced the vote would be included in their reelection scorecards, and redstate.com (a conservative website) vowed to place primary challengers against SOPA House members. Democrats did not turn against SOPA and PIPA as quickly since Democrats held the Senate Majority, and they were pressured by the movie industry against Sillicon Valley. Former Democratic  Senator Chriss Dodd, then President of the Motion Picture Association of America, vowed to punish Democrats  and including President Obama's reelection effort if they turned their back on the censoring bills. Regardless, the pressure from Sillicon Valley and individual internet users' opposition from SOPA and PIPA was so large enough that  Dodd compared it to the Arab Spring . Defections became so widespread that co-sponsors to PIPA widthrew their support and both bills were tabled. A year later, Internet Service Providers working with Hollywood began lobbying for a stand-alone six-strikes policy that would ban consumers from accessing internet access if they had been identified by corporate copyright holders as infringing. Fight for the Future began an  education campaign on Virtual Private Networks on the importance ofprivate internet access as a tool against ISP's monopoly power and surveillance mechanisms.  Surveillance  A second set of issues tied to online freedom focused on government surveilance. Six months after the SOPA/PIPA protests, Fight for the Future picked up on theCyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act of 2011 (CISPA), creating the  Do You Have a Secret campaign in June 2012 to email and call Congress against spying and surveillance. In it, Fight For the Future  quoted a 2009 New York Times piece  that identified the NSA's systematic collection of American's domestic communications as a result of a July 2008 legislative change from the W. Bush warrantless wiretap. The campaign was created a year before the Snowden revelations of the extent of NSA surveillance practices.  In July 2012 Fight for the Future amalgamated tech community companies into the Internet Defense League as a permanent mobilization effort against censorship and surveillance legislation, which rallied against CISPA; Fight for the Future worked with Demand Progress to  deliver over 300,000 signatures two days after CISPA  was reitroduced, and the Internet Defense League kept up the pressure the following months by deploying its high profile company affiliates to recruit other internet companies into fighting CISPA. This included Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian trying to call Google CEO Larry Page and Twitter and Facebook headquarters in a  YouTube video  as part of a shaming campaign, although a few months later Snowden would reveal their silence on CISPA reflected active complicity, not ambivalence. The coallition also used the attention from the Snowden revelations to turn Independence Day (July 4th, 2013) into  4th Amendment (protection against unreasonable search and seizure) rallies  in New York, Washington DC, San Francisco, Dallas, called  ""Restore the Fourth"" .  The San Francisco rally also  directly protested Senator Dianne Feinstein's role in passing the PATRIOT ACT which opened the door to the Bush administration's warrantless wiretaps. In the subsequent weeks the organization  cowdfunded and projected a documentary about NSA  spying in Manhattan, held the Stop Watching Us Rally in washington and delivered 575,000 signatures to Republican congressman Justin Amash (a self-described libertarian and member of the Freedom Caucus). These efforts led to the Reset the Net campaign for privacy rights in June 5th, 2014. Unlike their previous politically-engaging work, this campaign  centered on mobilizing websites, companies and app developers into adopting specific security protocols , especially end-to-end encryption, among other technological fixes like adopting SSL. This was framed as an act of resistance against illegitimate mass surveillance, although there was also a petition for internet users to sign . The campaign was presented as a ""privacy pack"". Companies and website owners would implement technical privacy fixes and also run a  banner  that would not display until midnight June 5th, to present a coordinated message reminiscent of their anti-copyright campaing against SOPA/PIPA. Internet users were also provided with best practices for password protection and private anonymous internet browsing on computers, as well as a list of suggested encrypted chat apps for phones. The campaign had the backing of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden , ACLU attorney Jennifer Granick, and security expert Bruce Schneier, as well as Silicon Valley and NGO support.  In 2015, as parts of the PATRIOT Act hit their sunset clause, Fight for the Future reactivated its anti-surveillance efforts by  l  aunching a campaign to black out Congress , whereby  websites which signed up would identify internet traffic from congressional networks and redirect their traffic to a blacked out banner  and a slew of topless pictures provided by protestors with the slogan #ifeelnaked to symbolize the NSA's mass spying as a digital strip search. Its aim was to defeatthe adoption of  ""compromise"" bills  authored by Senators Feinstein and Burr like the USA Freedom Act because ""the NSA considers the USA Freedom Act completely benign and it will not change their operations in the slightest”, according to Fight for the Future's cofounder, Holmes Wilson, since it would only curtail one of many ways bulk phone records are collected, and would leave other data collection sources and inter-agency backdoor access unregulated. The organization also rebuked the  false dichotomy  of reauthorizing the PATRIOT Act's bulk collection as the alternative to adopting new the new proposed legislation, pushing to let the provisions on mass surveillance sunset on June 1st. The Internet Defense League member sites signed onto the campaign, which were a part of the more than 10,000 websites that had installed the blackout code. The number included non-league members since the campaign gained traction on Reddit's (one of the league members) technology section. Fight for the Future then updated the Electronic Frontier Foundation's ""Stand Against Spying"" scorecard, which covered legislative activity in the 113th Congress (2013-14), to take into account votes taken in the legislative battle over Section 215 renewal and the USA FREEDOM Act, which provided limited reforms of Section 215. Through their Restore the Fourth coalition (led by Alex Marthews and Zaki Manian of Restore), Fight for the Future's (led byTiffiniy Cheng and Jeff Lyon)  new political scoreboard  that accounted for the ambiguity of voting for the Freedom Act, since a Yes/No vote could not be interpreted as support or rejection of surveillance per se. Their political scoreboard showed that African-American legislators were more likely to support reform, while those with a military background or having been part of the intelligence committee were more likely to support the NSA. Importantly, the scoreboard  outlined that partisanship was not a reliable indicator  of positions on the bill's surveillance regulations and disuaded journalists from generalizing probable votes. The Sunset 702 campaign scoreboard also scored how tech companies had reacted to news that they had collaborated with NSA surveillance or been leaking consumer an political information. If companies had supported limiting surveillance, they would be marked as ""Team Internet"", if they supported bils that gave them corporate immunity or supported surveillance, they would be labeled ""Team NSA"". After failing to pass in its November version because it could not overcome Senatorial fillibusters, the amended June version of the Freedom Act passed  despite bipartisan opposition from Senators Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders and Fight for the Future's Sunset Section 702 campaign. The House bill (HR2048), sponsored by Republican Jim Sensenbrenner, promised to increase the controversialForeign Intelligence Surveillance Courtwarrant-obtaining process, but restored authorization for roving wiretaps and tracking 'lone wolf' actors deemed to be terrorists by the Executive branch, and was  heavily criticized by privacy advocates for having too many loopholes , and  the Senate's author of the Freedom Act criticized how reforms were striped  from the original bill.  After passage of the Freedom Act, Fight for the Future launched a  follow-up campaign, End Surveillance , that tied the issue of mass surveillance to censorship, government control, and intimidation against journalists and dissenting activists like those connected with Black Lives Matter, shifting focus to how the NSA's tactics feed into the FBI's domestic operations. The campaign presented the state of surveillance legislation and highlighted the recurring attempts to pass CISPA to formalize data-sharing between private companies' customer data and federal agencies by  providing companies with liability immunity from disgruntled customers , lowering their economic and public relations costs.  The following year, after the 2016 San Bernadino shootings, a California Judge granted the Los Angeles US Attorney's demand (on behalf of the FBI) that Apple create a  backdoor on encrypted phones by disabling the ""wipe disk"" function  if the security pin is entered incorrectly 10 times. Since CISPA's data-sharing arrangement kept stalling 4 attempts in, the government argued that the 1789 All Writs Act should be used to force Apple to cooperate. In response,  Fight for the Future organized protest rallies, Don't Break our Phones,  to support  Apple's appeal  against the court's pro-FBI order. The nationwide local rallies convened in Apple stores around the country at 5:30 on February 23, 2016. Fight for the Future asked that attendants  open their phone and tablet screens to text that read ""FBI, DON'T BREAK OUR PHONES! "" by accessing a  website that Fight for the Future updates to provide new digital protest signs ,  which currently say ""SAVE THE INTERNET""  in reference to their net neutrality campaign; as well as providing a one page flyer with four reasons to oppose the FBI's demand for attendants to distribute to passers-by and media crew.  During the lame duck period after the 2016 election, Fight for the Future made  an attempt at convincing President Obama  to disclose the extent of surveillance programs and their legal justification, delete stored data and pardon Edward Snowden to encourage whistleblowers, appealing to the election results by advocating that the new administration should be forced to build the spying capacity from scratch. The campaign went without response. Under the Trump administration, Fight for the Future tracked Congress extended the Foreign Intelligence Surveilance Act's controversial Section 702's warrantless wiretapping through the S.139 bill, despite a bipartisan pro-privacy amendment proposal to end warrantless wiretapping. Fight for the Future highlighted how bipartisan opposition was met with bipartisan rebuke of the amendment as Democrat House minority leader  Nancy Pelosi and 55 other democrats joined Republicans to vote down the pro-privacy amendment to S.139.  The process was especially complicated by the new President's initial rejection of the FISA extension given his suspicion of wiretaps, followed by a last-minute reversal of opinion. Fight for the Future's digital campaign centered on their Citizen's Veto effort, where people sign up their phone and get a reminder of their lawmakers' voting record on FISA before the next election, as a means of accountability. This method offsets the need to remember particular votes for two (House) or six years (Senate) while triggering issue saliency when it is most necessary. They also provided a link to their  Get Safe privacy toolkit , a step by step guide on protecting privacy by recommending hardware and software changes fine-tuned for specific devices and operating systems, new settings, habits, and additional information links to external sources of information,  like the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Surveillance Self-Defence .  As the Obama-era FCC moved to  adopt privacy rules that would bar internet provider services from being able to share web browsing history , app usage, location and the content of emails and other communications without the explicit consent of each individual subscriber at the end of its second term. The issue was triggered by Verizon's use of 'supercookies"" to track the websites their network users visited and sell the information to ad brokers;  it settled a 1.35 million dollar fine  and put the issue on the FCC's radar. Furthermore, the FCC pledged to review attempts to charge customers for maintaining their privacy, and the preliminary rules passed by a  3-2 vote in March 2016 . The rules only forbade ISPs from selling personally identifyable information, but could still share customer data if it was anonymized so that it couldn't be reasonably linked to an individual. After the November 2016 elections, the FCC charimanship went to former Verizon lobbyist Ajit Pai, who has made putting ISPs on a level playing field to Facebook and Google his priority, subverting net neutrality rules. On tracking, the new Congress cited burdening economic innovation, and Republican representatives (who held the majority) in the House and Senate voted to reverse the FCC rules. 15 Republicans crossed the aisle on a close vote in the House but their opposition was not enough (215 for the reversal, 205 for maintaining the FCC rules). After the vote,  Fight for the Future began sponsoring billboards in states where Senators had voted to remove internet browsing privacy protections,  naming and shaming Senators in their home state by showing their name, picture, how much s/he had received from telecommunication companies, and a link to Save Broadband Privacy campaign where people could sign a petition. The campaign started with bilboards against four members of Congress (rep. Blackburn, rep. Rutherford, Sen. Flake, and Sen. Heller) and was paid for through donations. Fight for the Future's campaign then  attempted to expand their method to other congresspeople who voted to overturn the FCC order, but fell below their target .  Crowdfunding went to billboards in three more states  : rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers in Washington, rep. Bob Latta of Ohio, and rep. Greg Walden of Oregon (sole holdout in the state, according to the Battle for the Net's  Oregon NetNeutrality Scoreboard .  The organization has also  repeated the billboard method  to the net neutrality fight in California against  Assemblyman Miguel Santiago , who was also called out by  local Battle for the Net activists using projectors and Wikipedia edits that changed AT&amp;T telecom as his spouse in protest over the vote. The protest succeeded in bringing national attention to Assemblyman Santiago, and after an about-face that sent the bill back to committee, where it was revived. Once it went to the state Senate, Fight for the Future  campaigned to have Californians contact their legilsators to support SB922 , and has been  adopted .  Given the lack of legal rights, its recent  Security Pledge  addressed company liability in protecting users' data by appealing directly to technology corporations, but has not registered any company pledging to its four data security principles.  Police militarization and criminalization of peaceful protestsIn relation to Black Lives Matter protests, the 2016 women's march, and Fight for the Future's on the ground protest work, the organization has been highlighting the increasing  militarization of police  in the US, and the trend towards state  legislation criminalizing peaceful protests , pointing to how the organization connects digital and  on the ground policing and surveillance against free speech  as part of the same political process, discussing both in terms of reversing Congressional budget allocation for military technology purchases by local police through a  petition drive inspired by the state-violence of Ferguson. Fight for the Future also pointed their members to researcher Zeynep Tufekci's direct link between the Ferguson protests, algorithmic censorship, and net neutrality .. Crowdfunding went to billboards in three more states: rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers in Washington, rep. Bob Latta of Ohio, and rep. Greg Walden of Oregon  Net Neutrality:  Battle for the Net campaign   In 2014 the FCC lost to Verizon's appeal against the 2010 net neutrality order because it chose the wrong legal framework to justify the Open Internet order. In order to remediate this, Fight for the Future joined 85 other organizations to deliver one million signatures in a petition drive asking FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler to remediate the issue by reclassifying broadband under the common carrier framework. The organization also coordinated protestors' physical presence by gathering people outside the FCC headquarters in Washington DC for nine days,  touting that the mere promise of a campout led Chariman Wheeler to reach out to Fight for the Future about the possibility of meeting , something that the FCC had rejected when they received the million signature petition. The pressure also helped the two Democrat commissioners appeal to the Chairman to reconsider classifying the internet as a public utility. A Sunlight Foundation machine learning model on a subset (800,959) of the more than 3.7 million FCC comments found that at least 60% of comments were letters written by organized campains, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Nation, Battle for the Net (Fight for the Future), but remarked that that proportion was lower than other high-volume regulatory dockets. A third of the comments were coordinated by Fight for the Future's Battle for the Net campaign, Daily Kos and Free Pressch begain that year (2014) and has become a  spin-off organization ( Battle for the Net)and mobilization arm that supports net neutrality.  Fight for the Future then called on President Obama to fulfill his campaign promise to protect net neutrality through a petition, a twitter campaign, presenting his position as candidate, outlining his powers in protecting net neutrality insofar as mechanisms to reform the FCC. It also helped organize meetings between constitutents and House of Representatives in San Antonio, Texas, in Ithaca, New York, and in Green Bay, Wisconsin.  The Open Internet net neutrality order  was adopted in March 2015 , the net neutrality issue died down until 2017, when the issue was reopened by the new administration's chairman, Ajit Pai, a former Verizon lawyer who had  dissented  and voted against the order when he was FCC commissioner during the previous comission. Fight for the Future called  June 12 2017 a day of action through online protests . It prepared materials for people who signed up, and asked those who did to identify whether they had a large online audience or friend/employer who did. It also called for websites, companies and organization's participation, ranging from the ACLU to PornHub, from Vivaldi to BitTorent (two companies on opposite sides of the copyright debate), backing from the Women's March to the pot-advocacy magazine HighTimes. The campaign tried other previously used methods too, like distributing banners and code to simulate slowdowns and paywalls that replicate what the end of net neutrality might look like, and made it easy for internet users to submit their comments to the FCC and Congress through these banners, push notifications for apps, and social media memes, making participating websites a part of the comment-gathering process and distributing information dissemination to a wide variety of audiences.  The commission does not allow for more than 3 commissioners to be of the same party, and the December 2017  vote rescinding the 2015 order followed a party-line vote of 3-2 . After the FCC vote,  Fight for the Future started its Break the Internet campaign to pressure Congress to reverse the vote through using the Congressional Review Act (CRA), directing contact through  Battle for the Net , which held the  One More Vote operation  for the Senate's vote on February 27, 2018. The Senate supported the move, and the focus of the campaign now lies in convincing the House of Representatives to adopt  the CRA resolution that the Senate passed (52 for -47 against) through a  discharge petition , where House members can force a vote on net neutrality despite the House Leader Paul Ryan's oppostion to bring it to a floor vote.  Furthermore, Fight for the Future is  raising the issue salience of net neutrality during the 2018 midterm election by identifying 23 close House races where candidates opposing net neutrality are vulnerable  to losing their seat, who is running against them and is a supporter of net neutrality and who has no stance, using their scorecard method. For example, in Iowa the Democratic candidate has no stance but the Green party candidate supports it, while the Republican incumbent opposed restoring net neutrality through the CRA. The Vote for Net Neurality campaign also lets Americans sign up for a bot called  HelloVote  that helps them register to vote, contact politicians in the area and inform them on where they stand on the issue. Lastly, it is running local action team recruitment to organize protests, hand out lawn signs and do voter education at the polls in districts it has identified as key, using the Facebook website. It has also put together avatar images and a document with outreach materials (sample Twitter messages and Facebook posts) for internet users. Their Dont Tread on the Net campaign  frames the issue as one of corporate censorship with government support for ISP monopoly and its petition is geared towards Republican lawmakers, calling the FCC bureaucrats that killed net neutrality as part of a big government-pro corporation coallition. By using a modified Gadsden flag, the campaign seeks to highlight the bipartisan nature of net neutrality among the population (83% in general, 75% Republicans, 76% Independents), bringin up conservative support from Justice Scalia and a plea from Julian Assange to President Trump against media monopolies, as well as technologist Tim Berners-Lee. The campaign makes an appeal to Republicans' vulnerability in letting Democrats take the credit for saving net neutrality in a bid to make the pro-neutrality stance as competitive legislatively as it is bipartisan in the population. A third campaign, on August 16 2018 sought to mobilize small businesses' dependence on open and neutral internet access against large ISPs that throttle content, descriptively called  Businesses for Net Neutrality . It asked signors, legally authorized to represent their company's position, to sign a petition that would be distributed to their members of Congress. Their voter follow-up campaing to Vote for Net Neutrality, called  Red Alert , was run through under the Battle for the Net umbrella, and reported on progress.  Fight for the Future has also been  involved in an open-data and accountability effort looking into the charge  that the FCC allowed Comcast to  astroturf  the net neutrality reversal comment process through theCouncil for Individual Freedom, and . The accusation that there was a coordinated effort to fraudulently use the identities of individuals without their knowledge or consent, possibly  from direct breach data or warehouse lists created from data breaches . The evidence gathered is points to bots that submitted at least half a million anti-net neutrality comments using real people's stolen identities in an effort to make it look like legitimate grassroots moblization against astroturfing. Appealing to the Reddit community, and  suppoting the effort of local media in Denver, in reviewing the docket,as well as running its own operation in Tampa, Florida, Fight for the Future and other organizations have helped uncover fraud in the proceedings, which has fuled a complaint (September 20, 2018) by the  New York Times against the FCC's refusal to comply with multiple Freedom of Information Act requests .  International efforts  On the heels of the anti-PIPA and anti-SOPA, Fight for the Future built tools for efforts outside the US, starting with  opposition to  Europe'sAnti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA) which was defeated in the European Parliament , then worked with Canada's  OpenMedia  to  oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)  since  its intellectual property rules echoed SOPA/PIPA censorship proposals , specifically by targetting the Congressional delegation of "" fast track "" authority to the President as an  undemocrative shirk  of the legislative's responsibility to check and balanace the executive branch. In 2016, in conjunction with  Citizens Trade Campaign , and as a  return to their union workers' roots , Fight for the Future co-organized the  Rock Against the TPP series of concerts . The events ran through Denver, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, San Diego, Boston and Pittsburgh from July to November to raise awareness against the TPP, with an accompanying protest petition signature and Congressional call drive effort. It has also come to the  defense of Russian protest band Pussy Riot .  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Fight for the Future's major policy successes have happened when high-volume individual users have been combined with big-clout corporations to levearge regulators and legislatiors. They have also grown their organization's engagement capacity by linking controversial issues to ongoing and long-term vote mobilization strategies. In developing tools like the poltical scorecard and the HelloVote bot, they have made single-issue grassroot participants keep track of politicians' track records and has linked participatory democracy campaigns to votes, duplicating the impact of their work. Other efforts where individual mobilization is not in line with big companies, like the surveillance track, have been harder to advance, and efforts to engage with tech companies on surveillance has been met with silence.  Publications  Fight for the Future is not a research organization so does not publish traditional reports. However, it frequently publishes press releases in the news section [10] and keeps statistics of their campaign engagement in each campaign description.

 Common Causes's tagline is ""holding power accountable"" and its stated mission is to ""work to create open, honest, and accountable government that serves the public interest; promote equal rights, opportunity, and representation for all; and empower all people to make their voices heard in the political process."" 
 Origins and DevelopmentFounded in 1970 by John W. Gardner, a Republican Secretary of Health Education, and Welfare in the administration of President Lyndon Johnson as well as chair of the National Urban Coalition, it has been characterized as an advocacy group for minorities and the working poor in urban areas (Chapman and Ciment); it started with 4,000 core members to serve as a people's lobby,  and now boasts over a million members and supporters spread out between 30 states and Washington D.C. 
 Before the 1990s, the group was known for efforts to end the Vietnam War and lowering the voting age to 18, from 21. Its 1970s Colorado branch pioneered the campaign for state legislation as the nation’s first open meetings law, which passed in 1972 ( Colorado Sunshine Law for open meetings ). Since then, nearly every state — sometimes with Common Cause leadership— has passed laws that guarantee the people’s access to public records, require legislative hearings be open to the public, and bring more  transparency to government budgets and spending . 
 Post-1990s (using the Wayback Machine internet archiving website, the first snapshot at December 1996) the emphasis had shifted towards the role of money in politics. The 1996 newsletter has an action alert highlighting campaign financing corruption in fundraising, soft money from special interests and a call for action targeting Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott from Mississippi via fax to shape the 1997 agenda on campaign finance reform after the group highlighted the Republican's $7.3 million ""soft money"" fundraising ranging from Fruit of the Loom to the NRA in the  first four months of 1995 . The focus on accountability for money in politics has been bipartisan, as  demonstrated by a call in 1997  for Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate President Clinton's meeting with a Thai campaign contribution which led to the return of over a quarter million dollars given to the Democratic National Committee. 
 Continued focus on corrosive effect of money in American politics is patent when looking at the distribution of specialization and activities of their current work twenty years later, which regained traction after the 2010 US Supreme Court decision Citizens United v. FEC. 
 Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 Common Cause is a 501(c)(4) non-partisan nonprofit, which relies on tax-deductible contribution to an organization in their state network, membership services and recurring monthly contribution to the Education Fund planned giving through estate, bequest, a retirement account or life insurance beneficiary; stock and securities gifts, and memorial or tribute gifts on behalf of another person. 
 Financials for it and its education fund are  made publically available on its website . Total revenue for  2017 is reported  at $17,039,285 (~13.94 million from contributions), while expenses ran at $15,361,092; compared to $14,712,392 (~12.19 contributions) revenue and $14,590,280 expenses  in 2016,  and $15,168,101 (~11.96 contributions) and $15,392,595 expenses  in 2015 . 
 A grant from the  WhyNot Initiative sponsored Common Cause's 2016 fourth annual conference  in DC,  ""Blueprint for a Great Democracy Conference "". 
 Common Cause has chapters in 30 states: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin. 
 Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 The organization's efforts run on the national and state-level, the latter of which are coordinated by local state chapters of which there are 30. They use a variety of methods and tools to accomplish their work include grassroots organizing, coalition building, research, policy development, public education, lobbying and litigation to win reform at all levels of government. 
 Through the network, Common Cause has established a non-profit affiliate for public education, engagement, and research called the Education Fund. It uses grants and tax-deductible contributions to build public engagement on democracy issues and promote the effective citizen participation critical for a healthy, robust democratic society. The organization also provides an 'election-reminder service' to individuals who supply their residence and contact information.Major Projects and Events 
 Its most prominent projects are run through state-chapters (as a function of the federal electoral system) for citizen-funded elections campaigns [see the Campaign finance in Money and Influence section]: a large focus of the organization which influence its other work on issues like vote integrity and media.Common Cause divides their efforts into six main axis of work: 1. Ethics and AccountabilityCommon Cause uses several tactics to hold politicians accountable to ethical standards so they serve the people, not themselves; campaigns are divided by government branches (legislative, executive, and judicial). 
 Legislative ethics 
 Mobilization of activists led to the House of Representatives' creation of an independent watchdog, the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE), in 2007, and to the passage of the Freedom of Information laws, the STOCK Act that prohibits legislators from profiting from insider information. 
 Executive ethics 
 Currently running a petition campaign under their Executive Ethics module, for Congress to pass the MAR-A-LAGO Act, which would make public visitor logs from the White House and anywhere else the President regularly conducts business, like the Florida estate that lends its name to the bill, as a way of holding President Trump accountable for reversing the Obama policy of publishing visitor logs through legislation. Another initiative under the banner of 'Executive ethics' is the organization's report on the state of the Domestic and Foreign Emoluments Clauses. 
 Judicial ethics 
 Successful  focus on the role of money in judicial politics, especially for elected judges' political spending to be disclosed. Efforts by Common Cause to enforce the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, which requires all federal judges to disclose their spouse's employer led Supreme Court Justice (unelected) Clarence Thomas to amend 20 years worth of financial statements and to disclose his wife, Ginni Thomas, as a paid Tea Party activist with the Liberty Central political education group. 2. Money and InfluenceThe Education Fund produces research and reports to document the influence of money in the political process, public education campaigns [targeting candidates or voters? Track record?] on the power of small-dollar donors. 
 Common Cause has identified campaign finance law violations and file complaints with the FEC, including a  complaint against Kid Rock's false Senate run  where he collected campaign contributions without registering, Walmart's  use of illegal methods  to  persuade employees to donate to its PAC  by using Walmart-charity donations filed alongside Public Citizen and the Our Walmart union, and complaints related to the 2016 election related to Russian interference, but their most high profile complaint is the January 2018  filing with the Department of Justice and the FEC  about Michael Cohen's in-kind campaign contribution to Stephanie Clifford to avoid disclosures of then candidate-Trump's affair with her. In response to the Common Cause complaint, Cohen admitted to facilitating the payments in February 2018 and set off a criminal investigation of Cohen with the DOJ. 
 Corporate accountability 
 Common Cause joined the Corporate Reform Coalition in response to the 2010 Citizens United US Supreme Court case. Their goals are focused on a 3-pronged strategy: advocating for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to adopt a rule that would require publicly-traded companies to disclose direct and indirect political spending; supporting efforts by shareholders and investors to pass shareholder resolutions that require companies to publicly disclose their campaign and lobbying spending; and working in the states to pass  disclosure and shareholder rights laws . Common Cause worked on the California DISCLOSE Act,  signed by Gov. Brown in 2017 requires the three largest funders of political ads to be clearly identified at the beginning of ads (TV, radio, print, and online ads) for ballot campaigns and independent expenditures.  Similar disclosure laws have been passed in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Mexico, Maryland, Connecticut, Hawaii, Montana, and Delaware with the help of Common Cause.  It is also supporting a Santa Monica initiative for transparency in the ballot initiatives  (SB 651) to disclose the top 3 funders and committee name of any petition on the petition or a separate document. 
 Lobbying 
 Common Cause works on lobbying laws that require strong disclosure and registration rules for lobbyists at both the state and federal level and stopping the revolving door. It has been instrumental in pushing key lobbying reforms through Congress, including the Lobbying Disclosure Act and the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which provided increased transparency for the American public and extended the “cooling off” period for former public officials before they can lobby their former colleagues (2 years). 
 One area of focus is  ALEC. Using a whistleblower complaint  with the Internal Revenue Service, Common Cause has presented evidence against the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a lobbying group that represents the largest corporations in the US, which crafts model legislations, pays for legislator expenses to go to ALEC conferences  where representatives are lobbied and then campaign-financed to pass ALEC-written legislation  on taxes and budgets, climate change and the environment, workers’ rights and collective bargaining, healthcare, telecommunications policy, election laws, and education. It charges that ALEC has violated its tax-exempt status by operating as a lobby while claiming to be a charity. 
 Campaign finance reform through citizen funded elections 
 campaigns at the state and local levels to pass and improve citizen funded election programs, including in Connecticut; Arizona; Maine; New York City; Los Angeles, CA; Montgomery County, MD; Howard County, MD; Suffolk County, NY; Berkeley, CA; Portland, OR; Seattle, WA; Santa Fe, NM; Albuquerque, NM; and Washington, DC, and  has supported the introduction of federal bills in Congress to create a public campaign finance system based on matching donations , like the Government By The People Act and the Fair Elections Now Act. Connecticut: spearheaded the Citizens’ Election Program (2005)  which uses small-dollar donors and allowing people of modest means to seek and win public office to diversify representation in Hartford's legislature. The program lets anyone running for office apply for a grant of public funds after running a minimum amount of contributions, ranging from 5,000 total for state representative offices to 250,000 for governor. The amount of money received will depend on the stage of election, whether candidates are running unopposed, or opposed by a small party candidate, and the percent of votes cast for a small party in the previous election if running as a minor-party. In the  13 years it has been in use , it has allowed candidates for the state Senate, House, and constitutional offices to run without the need for large-donor contributions. Oregon: with the help of Common Cause , which brought together in a coalition of more than 30 organizations called A Voice for All Portland, the representatives of the City of Portland council launched an opt in Small Donor Election Program for candidates of the 2020 election who agree not to take contributions over $250. In exchange, the first $50 of a contribution is matched by 6x public funding. Maryland: citizen-funded elections  at the county level started in 2014 in Montgomery, then 2017 with the Howard county setting up a program for the 2022 election, and Prince George county is working with Common Cause on an ongoing project; at the gubernatorial level the 2014 election used at he Fair Campaign Finance Fund. Work has also been conducted through the Fair Elections Maryland coalition. 
 Los Angeles, California: active campaign, two primary goals for public financing reform are reducing elected officials' dependence on outside interest's money and allowing people without personal wealth or access to donors but strong community ties to run for office. Working with the   LA City Ethics Commission , the program matches constituents' small dollar donations with public money, which means candidates have a bigger incentive to spend time with their constituents to incentivize donations, in turn voters feel greater ownership over local elections, and are more likely to participate in elections. Their current campaign  supports the LA Ethics Commission's recommendations to increase fund rates to a 6:1 ratio  and raising maximum fund allotments for specific primary and general election. Strengthening accountability institutions like the Federal Election Commission (FEC) , so that it has the power to decide cases and enforce punishments independently, without having to go to court, to stop illegal political activities when issues are raised before elections, instead of retroactive accountability years afterwards; has also worked to push the Department of Justice and other federal agencies to enforce electoral laws so the campaign finance system has a cop on the beat. 
 Repealing Citizens United through a Constitutional Amendment: as a response to the 2010 Citizens United judicial decision that allows interest groups unlimited spending on elections, Common Cause has joined partner organizations to amend the US constitution with an amendment, Democracy for All. A vote was carried out in 2014 in the Senate but a Republican filibuster blocked it. 
 Disclosure and transparency: Federally, Common Cause is currently working on disclosure legislative and executive/administrative reforms that echo state laws and initiatives that have successfully passed in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, California, Montana, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, like: the DISCLOSE Act and Honest Ads Act; petitioning the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to approve a new rule governing secret money groups that abuse the tax law; advocating for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to adopt a rule requiring publicly traded corporations to disclose their political spending to shareholders; pushing the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to approve new rules for broadcasters that increase transparency on political advertisements; petitioning the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to strengthen and enforce disclosure rules; urging the President of the United States to sign an executive order requiring federal government contractors to  disclose their political spending.3. Gerrymandering and RepresentationCommon Cause Education Fund is engaged in key court cases with national implications: Common Cause v. Rucho (North Carolina), Gill v. Whitford (Wisconsin), and Benisek v. Lamone (Maryland). In Michigan, Common Cause filed an amicus brief  with former U.S. Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI) and former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R-CA) after having led the effort to create a citizen redistricting commission in California and other states, in order to support the Voters Not Politicians ballot initiative, which was under review by the Michigan Supreme Court  following a well-funded special interests lawsuit to keep the initiative off the November 2018 ballot. In August 1st, the Michigan SC voted 4-3 to reject that lawsuit, meaning the state voters will vote on whether to change redistricting powers by stripping state legislators of their power (which often leads to political gerrymandering) in favor of an independent citizen redistricting commission who would draw the U.S. House and state legislative districts after each decennial census. Colorado, Missouri and Utah – are also looking to the November 2018 ballot to approve proposed redistricting reforms; Ohio approved reforms in May 2018. 4. Voting and ElectionsExpansion of voting rights and election integrity through several initiatives. 
 National Popular Vote drive 
 To avoid presidential candidates winning the electoral college without having won the popular vote, as two of the last five presidential elections, and to create campaigns that are more responsive to all Americans instead of swing states, Common Cause is lobbying for a states to  join the National Popular Vote Compact, so they allocate their votes according to the national popular vote winner instead of the state winner, which means no constitutional amendment would be necessary. Washington, California, Illinois, Maryland, New jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Vermont, Hawaii, and DC, have joined the compact. 
 Protection of the right to vote 
 After the 2013 Supreme Court revisal of the Voting Rights Act, Common Cause is pushing for the adoption of the Voting Rights Advancement Act (VRAA) would restore the VRA’s critical voting protections, and to fight back on 20 states' recent voting restrictions (cutting early voting, strict voter ID requirements, rolling back reforms). 
 Voter registration modernization: 
 implementation of four methods that increase turnout: automatic voter registration through motor vehicle agencies that keep systems up-to-date, same day registration during election day, registration online through secure government websites, and pre-registration of high school students which is automatically activated when they turn 18. Because voting is organized by states, Common Cause has worked with 13 states on adopting Automatic Voter Registration that reaches voters despite their party preference. The 2017 report by the US Election Assistance Commission documented how after Oregon's automatic voter registration law passed, there was a 12% increase in registered voters, Vermont's added more than 12,000 voters in the first six months after passing in 2017, almost double the amount in the previous (election) year. 
 Election Protection: 
 Common Cause mobilizes volunteers to be on the ground to be poll monitors, and teams of legal experts on a hotline that fights back against voter suppression and illegal intimidation practices. Patterns and practices are studied and brought to the attention of administrators to preempt their repetition and to diffuse hotly contested races where confusion and complications may be more likely. Monitors also help inform voters in real time. 
 Election integrity: 
 Common Cause delineates risk-limiting practices that protect from cyber-attacks and ensure accurate, secure, and fair elections against domestic and foreign vote-counting hacks through upgrading technology against old and outdated voting machines, and returning to paper ballots in every state, post-election audit of ballots, paper back-ups of voter registration databases and electronic voter rolls. Publication of a state-by-state assessment and state-of-technology of online voting and its points of vulnerability (see publications, The Secret Ballot at Risk). 
 In 2018 it, along with the Brennan Center for Justice, Common Cause, the National Election Defense Coalition, and Verified Voting  published a toolkit  for advocates and election officials to put to use the $380 million Congress approved for administration officials' election technology and electoral security. Replacement of machines that do not retain paper records (direct-recording electronic machines that store records directly onto the computer memory) for recounts and audits must be replaced immediately with voter-marked paper ballots (VVPATs) to follow best practices for post-election audits, replacement of machines where the vendor cannot service the original software or where machines are no longer manufactured and thus any hardware malfunctioning  cannot be replaced unless parts are found by third party unregulated vendors. 33 states reported equipment must be replaced by 2020 and 22 of these states do not have the funds to do so. The toolkit places emphasis on the need for systems that allow for secure post-election audits which are ensured by voter-marked paper ballots, and that voting equipment not have wifi capability. Finally, Common Cause has made a political argument  that candidates who win within a framework of insecure voting machines must put country over party and secure voting machines as part of a paradigm shift which echoes the Netherlands, France, Britain and Germany's rejection of machine counting of votes. 5. Media and Democracypromotion of free speech and accountability in the media through the Common Cause Education Fund, working towards protecting an open internet against media monopoly consolidation, for affordable high-speed internet access. Currently, it is running a campaign in California for the Social Media disclosure act (AB 2188) as a follow up to their supported California Disclosure Act ( passed with support from Common Cause, signed by Governor Brown in 2017 ), requires all online social media platforms to include ""who funded this ad"" information on sponsored posts, which will list the top three funders of the ad, disclosing advertisement and public information on political ad funding on social media. 
 On net neutrality, Common Cause has Michael Copps, former FCC commissioner during the W. Bush administration and acting Chairman during the first six months of the Obama Presidency, as special advisor. 
 Successful efforts for net neutrality 
 In Oregon, Common Cause helped the state pass a net neutrality bill that requires state and local governments to do business only with ISPs that  observe net neutrality protections, which was signed into law by Governor Kate Brown in April and kicked in in June , although their law is less restrictive than Washington state's. Oregon has led states rights causes in the matter of net neutrality, being the first to unexpectedly pass their bill, with overwhelming public support. New York, the Common Cause chapter joined advocacy groups  in 2014 to oppose the Comcast-Time Warner merger, and the Public Service Commission rejected the deal. 
 Ongoing: 
 In California, they are supporting SB 822, which mandates net neutrality in the State, and prohibits state agencies from using or funding ISPs who violate net neutrality principles, and has been  called the ""gold standard"" of net neutrality  for  its stringent protections . 
 Colorado: informal (no concrete legislation in the works) congressional lobbying to reinstate net neutrality protections. Common Cause Colorado also works on high-speed internet access, has informal efforts to combat the 2005 state act that restricts communal and municipal networks by requiring a ballot initiative at a cost to municipalities. New York: fighting the FCC  so that New York can enforce its own open internet rules given the FCC's reversal, and supporting federal efforts to use the Congressional Review Act to reinstate Obama-era net neutrality rules. 
 Other NY efforts: Common Cause has an informal effort for closing the digital access divide, especially in rural areas, poor urban neighborhoods and tribal land, but particular initiatives are not explicit. They are, however, fighting the monopoly power or telecommunication companies by  forming a coalition with the Consumer's Union under the Waiting4FiOS campaign  which calls for and aggregates consumer interactions with Verizon in order to pressure them to complete building their Fiber Optic Service as per its 2008 NYC franchise agreement, to sign a petition for the NY city council, and to attend official public forums. 
 Rhode Island has an informal axis for net neutrality but no concrete plan of action at the state or state-to-federal level. 
 No explicit effort on Media and Democracy in general, nor net neutrality specifically: Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin. 6. Constitution, Courts and other Democracy Issues:Rejecting an Article V Constitutional Convention: 
 Common Cause is ringing the alarm against the constitutional convention that wealthy special interests (ALEC and the Koch brothers' organizations) are pushing to convene for a constitutional convention to adopt a ""balanced budget amendment""  as a means of forcing cuts to the social safety net, as documented  by  historian MacLean  ( video interview ); and 28 of the necessary 34 states have passed resolutions calling for it to occur. The other proposed amendments, commonly known as the ""Liberty Amendments"" include: repealing the 17th Amendment (popular election of the Senate, in favor of a return to state legislature-elected Senators because state legislatures can be captured by special interests more easily and cheaply), subjecting federal departments to periodic reauthorization and review (which further politicizes their regulatory work), imposing term limits for Supreme Court Justices and restricting judicial review (which also politicizes the courts), creating a more specific definition of Article I, section 8, Clause 3 (known as the Commerce Clause), limiting eminent domain powers, allow states to bypass Congress more flexible by making the adoption of Constitutional amendments easier, including the reintroduction of the concept of nullification of federal laws by states by creating a process where 2/3 of states can nullify federal acts, and requiring photo ID and limiting early voting.Fair Courts: 
 advocacy for a transparent and fair process in selecting judges (additional information on specific campaigns is not available on their website). 
 Legislative gridlock relief: 
 Previous successes have included Senate reforms on silent filibuster rules, transparency in the legislative process, its budget and spending; advocating for no special interest giveaways in budgeting, scrutiny over hearings and processes to screen unqualified presidential nominees to the judicial or executive branches.

 Power Shift makes the case for federal campaign finance in light of the NRA's influence on the Legislative branch, and lists top recipients since 1989 in both chambers. State of the Swamp  [part of the Executive Ethics campaign]: a review of conflicts of interest and ethical challenges of President Trump’s first 100 days in office in a report. Municipal Democracy Index  is a comprehensive survey of the governance, election, and campaign finance practices of all 482 California cities published in 2016. Highlight findings: The 2015 California Voter Participation Rights Act, prohibits cities from holding off-cycle elections if it results in turnout that is 25% lower than state elections: as a result, 31 additional cities have passed laws to on-cycle elections, many in just the past few months. Also as a result of recent legal changes (the California Voting Rights Act of 2001) and ensuing civil rights litigation, many large cities have changed their election system from at-large (city wide  election) to by-district council election. Compounded with this this change, by-district systems review their district map boundaries to ensure substantially equal population representation every ten years, and eight charter cities (prevalent in big cities) have established independent redistricting commissions which are non-partisan [ key findings direct link ;  full report link ]. 
 The Secret Ballot at Risk: coauthored by Verified Voting Foundation, EPIC Electronic Privacy Information Center and Common Cause, the Secret Ballot at Risk Report finds that given current technological standards, letting states transmit ballots online, which is allowed in 44 states, and statutory provisions in the other 6, erodes state-constitutionally protected secret ballot rights which conflict with 32 state's practices given current technological limitations. Alaska makes explicit a warning when voting online that the risk of a faulty transmission may occur explicit on absentee ballots. While risks are addressed, Common Cause is asking states to present alternatives for verifying ballots with privacy envelopes when mailing the ballot, and to use printed ballots mailed or deposited in safe election office drop-boxes.  In an editorial , the organization also advocates for quarantining all ballots received through the internet since a voter's computer integrity cannot be known. These ballots should be assumed to contain malware and results from them should be manually added these tallies instead of introducing them into the system.

 Mission and Purpose 
 The consortium critiques the capitalist business models of corporations that use of open, free and sharable data against citizen privacy and surveillance online and physically (internet of things, IoT).  The goal is to build services that give proportionate and controlled access to code-writters with explicit consent from users through cryptographic technologies like blockchain. 
 History 
 Participant Selection 
 DECODE’s consortium members are from Spain, the Netherlands, Italy, Sweden, France and the UK. Francesca Bria, Barcelona Chief Technology and Innovation Officer is the project coordinator. 
 Specializations and Activities 
 Decode specializes in building and distributing technological tools for consumer and community engagement that retains privacy. 
 Major projects and events 
 Four European pilot projects are creating platforms and tools that let individuals take back their personal information. They are distributed in Barcelona and in Amsterdam for now.Barcelona 's iDigital / BCNow Platform pilot.  This pilot partner with Barcelona City Council and the city’s digital democracy platform Decidim.Barcelona, to allow citizen-generated data to be aggregated and blended from a range of different sources, including noise levels from individual sensors, healthcare data, and administrative open data. This will be displayed in a BCNow dashboard, and will give citizens the option to control the use of that information for specific purposes, including to inform policy proposals. It will also provide anonymous verification capabilities (such as when creating and signing local petitions) to minimise the sharing of sensitive of personally identifiable data with the city council. Barcelona 's #MakingSense Internet of Things pilot.  Residents will be given noise sensors that are placed in the neighbourhood. DECODE will provide sessions to train and support participants to help them setup and use the  sensors to gather and analyse data to influence city-level decisions. The pilot tackles the technical challenges of collating and storing a stream of citizen-sensed data, while also enabling those citizens to control what information is shared. It builds on a local project, Making Sense, which was established in 2016 and has been co-funded by the European Commision. 
 Amsterdam's  Holiday rental register pilot.  This responds to sharing economy platforms such as Airbnb which have caused disruption in cities such as Amsterdam by pushing up the the price of rents, while legal rules around privacy have prevented effective sharing of occupancy data about hosts who break local legislation. The pilot involves collaboration with the Amsterdam Municipality and the FairBnB platform — which was started to provide a more sustainable solution for short-let accommodation, and reinvests profits back into local initiatives. DECODE will provide statistics and regulatory information to enable the community to govern the platform without compromising participants’ privacy. 
 Amsterdam's  Gebiedonline (Neighbourhood Online) pilot. Gebiedonline is a pre-existing co-operative digital platform that enables local people, groups and organisations to view events taking place in their neighbourhood, share news, exchange and borrow products and services, and to meet people. Amsterdam City Council is keen to spread this to other locations across the city and leverage the platform to increase involvement with policy and decision-making. It provides an opportunity for DECODE to test a more privacy-preserving local social network, with granular controls so that residents can decide what information they share. 
 Funding 
 DECODE is funded by the European Union's  Horizon 2020 (Project no. 732546).It is a three-year project, running between January 2017 and December 2019. In total €5m will be paid to the 14 consortium members undertaking the work. This is the biggest EU Research and Innovation programme ever with nearly €80 billion of funding available over 7 years (2014 to 2020). It is a flagship initiative aimed at securing Europe's global competitiveness. 
 Publications 
 Decode has multiple reports derived from its research[2], as well as basic definitions for its projects. Materials include prototype tools, pilot background research, legal licensing, rules, privacy requirements for projects, and policy documents, templates for methodology and co-creation frameworks,  and a survey on blockchain technology.

5458,organization,See Click Fix,https://participedia.net/organization/5458,"Online service that lets anyone report non-emergency neighborhood needs to their local government, and to discuss or collaborate between each other,commenting and documenting on neighbors’ petitions, building critical mass and helping government triage community needs.",0,2018-10-10,2018-10-10,121822,Isadora,https://participedia.net/user/121822,121822,Isadora,https://participedia.net/user/121822,en,,,New Haven,,,United States,41.308274,-72.9278835,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Mission and Purpose 
 Create a bridging platform with public-facing and government management tools for citizens to make their non-emergency needs known to public officials and other neighbors, who can then organize to manage issues. 
 History 
 The website was created in 2008 by Ben Berkowitz, Kam and Miles Lasater, and Jeff Blasius in New Haven Connecticut as a way for community members to publicly let their government officials know about graffiti, illegal waste dump (two of the most popular categories), other infrastructure needs like cracked sidewalks and potholes, as well as intangible quality of life issues like dangerous zones and areas where reckless drivers put others in harm’s way. With the increasing adoption of smartphones with GPS, cameras, and ubiquitous internet, the website has expanded into an app that streamlines high accuracy reporting; however, the initial website and ethos of SeeClickFix is that government should not be a blackbox. To that effect, since the beginning reporting was open and public facing. 
 Participant Selection 
 The service does not need the permission of local or state officials to work as an organizing platform for citizens and neighbors, but it offers premium management services to governments that want to contract them to streamline public complaints.  For those who prefer not to sign in, people can report anonymously sensitive topics related to their building (SeeClickFix team, Tucker Severson 2015), or to do guest reporting, without the need for an account, which has turned out to be a popular way of reporting on the fly or as a way of protecting citizens' anonymity. 
 This has created a range of reactions from government officials. While some have voiced discomfort at having shortcomings in public services pointed out in a publicly accessible platform, but SeeCLickFix has also seen interest in backend management. In the past 7 years newer developments in SeeClickFix have aimed at helping local governments streamline their “request management” within the bureaucracy. Once the management system is purchased, SeeClickFix has teams that guide the entity through the implementation process, decision-making on rollout, and continued connectivity between citizens’ request and its fulfillment. This means the website has a background component that works with governments to manage their operations. On the frontend, citizens use their phone or computers to log a complaint. The website shows similar requests and their address so users can also see whether someone else has reported an incident, or they can follow through with pictures, or more information like if the situation has deteriorated. After reporting the issue (which can also be reported anonymously) and geolocating it, if the city has enrolled, the user receives an email with the city logo with a ticket number. On the backend, the city works with SeeClickFix to merge their process with the website’s workflow. The office handling requests acknowledges receiving it, which generates an email for the citizen—creating a link between the management office and the SeeClickFix account holder, then assigns it to the correct worker or field agent and can set the due date. 
 The workflow for each city worker is managed through SeeClickFix, which filters by due date and status, links to the phone’s GPS which increases the likelihood that the correct issue will be addressed, and allows the worker to communicate back about each issue with the request managing office. The backend interface also allows anyone manning the reports desk to add other citizens who call in to the email response, creating an internal tally of engagement level, which can also help prioritize high-volume issues, while keeping everyone interested informed about the progress. The information is easily collated meaning departments can keep track of their progress and find areas of weakness in the service requests they are getting. Furthermore, the user has complete ownership of the issue—even after the official says the problem has been fixed, if the complainant disagrees she can reopen the case and challenge that assertion. 
 Specializations and Activities 
 As of 2017  there are approximately 300 organizations enrolled with SeeClickFix, most of which are US municipalities, city or county governments, usually located around college or university towns, across the country [1] . Hospitals and universities are other non-government organizations which have begun subscribing to the public communication and internal management system. In Canada, cities and councils have enrolled in Alberta, Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan [2] . If a locality is not enrolled as a customer of the SeeClickFIx management system, users can still report problems and set up watch areas, which are public-facing. The city, volunteer organizations, or other citizens can then take action and organize to problem-solve given the website’s commenting capabilities. 
 Users who sign in earn different amounts of “civic points” based on their level of participation (commenting, logging in, uploading images, creating a watch area, having an issue commented on, voted on, or followed up on) and discourages abuse by subtracting points if comments are flagged as inappropriate. These points are then translated into titles, like badges, that indicate status within the online community. 
 Not all reports are for pothole or graffiti. Reports of discarded syringes and other dangerous waste were used by the Burlington, Vermont Public Health Department to geolocate where public drop boxes were most needed, creating avenues for citizens to help with a public health crisis. 
 Major projects and events 
 In 2014 the service got its millionth request. 
 SeeClickFix is an example of how the open government is not enough. As time has passed, the community-centered platform has gained leverage by bringing in governments who are willing to be held accountable into dialogue with their residents, creating a feedback loop around dialogue and capacity-building that has changed the operational goal of the organization too. Beyond government demands, the “talkback” communication aspect of the service has put residents in contact with their neighbors, who in the process of discussing a concrete issue like the need for a stop sign in a cross road can bring attention to a larger issue, like public safety. An issue with high interest can have compounding effects, and can make the government prioritize finding a solution quickly, but it can also bring the community together to solve it on their own or to make it feel empowered in its capacity to be a co-producer of good governance. With time, SeeClickFix has seen these dynamics come out over and over again, and has adjusted its initial model to incentivize and make accessible these benefits to as many communities as it can. 
 Funding 
 Free services for citizens are now sustained by municipal memberships, though it is unclear what the operating costs and funding ratio is. 
 Publications 
 The service has started documenting https://seeclickfix.com/pages/case-studies.html case studieswhich have use figures but does not document ""failure"" cases where cities refused to engage with the service.  The service also has multiple outreach programs: blog posts highlight ways in which the community helps each other learn where to report issues like rogue university bus drivers even when SeeClickFix does not know (SeeClickFix team 2008); their local government GovLove podcast sprang from webinar events (SeeClickFix n.d.) with partner cities which are used to have local governments using SeeClickFix talking to each other (SeeClickFix team; Smith, Caroline 2015), and to give their residents a glimpse of their internal processes and lines of thinking. The webinars themselves have developed into annual conference  workshops  , called GovLove Summits (SeeClickFix team, Caroline Smith 2015).

Its central objective is to inspire a more representative form of democracy, with more deliberation and participation, by establishing aCitizens' Assembly with members drawn by lot, working in parallel with the elected Parliament.  Origins and Development  To achieve this objective, Agora decided to stand in the regional elections in May 2019 in the Brussels-Capital Region. Thanks to the trust of 3629 Brussels voters, the movement won one seat in the Brussels Parliament.  Agora is now organising a Brussels Citizens' Assembly, made up of 89 Brussels residents drawn by lot, whose proposals are then shared in Parliament by the elected spokesperson. At the same time, Agora works within parliament on participative democracy in general, with the particular aim of establishing the Assembly as a more permanent institution.  Through the assembly, Agora hopes to encourage the implementation of true citizen democracy. In addition to its legislative efforts, the Assembly also serves as a tool to inspire better representation, encourage debate and discussion, and increase participation, throughout the whole of society.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  As a volunteer organisation, Agora is organised in working groups, focussing on the assembly, parliamentary work, communication, external relations and internal organisation. Agora is supported by a handful of employees.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Agora promotes the citizen assembly model, and to that end launched the Brussels Citizens' Assembly (BCA) as an assembly consisting of 89 citizens drawn by lot.  This sample is statistically representative of the population in terms of age, gender and level of education.  This Assembly seeks to be deliberative, since the participants have different opinions, and are encouraged to share these, allowing ideas to develop and evolve.  Finally, the system is participatory in the sense that every Brussels resident has a real chance to actively participate in the decision-making process.  Major Projects and Events  Assemblies have been organised since 2019.

Please help us complete it.Mission and Purpose 
 The National Street Vendor Association (NASVI) in India is an association of Indian street vendor organisations working to protect the rights of vendors across the country through sustainable macro-level policy interventions. Engineered and promoted by NASVI, the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act was passed by the Parliament of India in 2014. NASVI now works to effectively implement the policy for the welfare of street vendors throughout India. [1]  
 Origins and Development 
 Participant Recruitment and Selection 
 NASVI follows a democratic process for processing and approving membership. Membership is open to Trade Unions; membership-based organisations, such as cooperatives, community-based organisations, and non-governmental organisations. Organisations are required to have more than 50 vendor members or work with more than 50 vendors. If organisations meet the criteria, they can request a membership application form. [2]  
 Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 NASVI, as a federation, regularly consults and hears from its members from across the country. It is run by a board of members. While leadership has primarily come through civil society organisations, some opportunities appear to exist to rise through the ranks. The organisation also advises on local advocacy efforts by its members. Rules of participation include knowledge and expertise, carrying local legitimacy (federated member organisations elect leaders) and willingness to accept and behave in accordance with membership rules, e.g. regarding transparency and openness, and financial appropriateness.

 The Global Challenges Foundation’s (GCF) objective is to contribute to minimizing, preferably eliminating, the major global threats to humanity. To achieve this, the GCF works in two ways: by increasing decision-makers’ and the public’s knowledge and insight about these challenges; and by stimulating discussion and innovative thinking about decision systems that would be able to manage the major global risks more effectively and equitably [1]. 
 The GCF has identified, what they have termed, five interdependent, global catastrophic risks: climate change, other large-scale environmental damage, politically motivated violence, extreme poverty, and population growth [2]. The organization has also identified two major barriers to addressing these problems. First, the scope has been underestimated due to inadequate understanding and problem analysis. Further, the international political system has not properly adapted to the global environment of today [2]. 
 Origins and Development 
 The GCF was founded by Laszlo Szombatfalvy in 2012 to address some of the largest problems facing our quickly changing and growing world. As the standard of living improves, so has life expectancy and with technological advances society has globalized, both economically and culturally [2]. While there are many benefits with these developments, there are also new, unique, and growing problems and risks. The GCF set out to research and identify some of the largest risks threatening the global population. The foundation is young and continually implementing new, unique methods for addressing these issues. See the sections below for how they disseminate their findings and what projects they have invested in. 
 Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 The GCF is organized with a fairly traditional corporate, organizational structure made up of a board, executive team, and secretariat. Founder, Laszlo Szombatfalvy, serves as the chairman of the board along with 7 other board members [1]. The secretariat is made up of 15 employees with Fredrik Karlsson leading the team as Executive Director [1]. The executive team is a cross section of leaders from the board and the secretariat [1]. These groups work together to compile research and data to determine goals and projects for the organization. Participants vary based on project, more information can be found below for how the organization recruits through third party partnerships for events, research funding awards, and surveys. 
 The majority of funding comes from donations made by Szombatfalvy as the founder of the organization. The funds are put toward a variety of research initiatives completed by the GCF, as well as, in the form of grants designated to other qualified groups [1]. See the major projects and events section for more information on the ways funding is managed and dispersed by the foundation. 
 Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 The GCF does continual research to determine the global catastrophic risks and analyze what is being done and should be done in the future to address these risks more effectively. Their global reach finds partnerships with governments and institutions around the world. They provide annual and quarterly reports with their findings. To see individual reports, follow the links in publications below. 
 The GCF conducts risk surveys with respondents from around the world¾through partnerships with local market research and survey companies¾to determine people’s attitudes toward global catastrophic risks and governance [1]. These surveys help to determine the extent to which global attitudes reflect the severity of the risks to help the GCF better identify gaps in understanding, global needs, and impacts of current initiatives. To date, these surveys have been conducted in 2014, 2017, and 2018, to access the surveys use the links below.

 2014:  https://globalchallenges.org/en/our-work/risk-survey/pulse-of-international-sentiment  
 Major Projects and Events The New Shape ProcessThe New Shape Prize was an open call from the GCF to find new models of global cooperation to address the rising global risks the GCF has identified. The submission closed in September 2017 and received over 2,702 entries from 122 countries. The submissions were discussed during the New Shape Forum and the top three finalists were each awarded $600,000 toward their work [1]. 
 The New Shape Forum brought together policy-makers, academics, and others in global governance for workshops and discussions that examine the future of global governance. The forum looked at ideas from the New Shape Prize to improve upon and explore the viability of these proposals to make a difference. Each of the top ideas was presented and followed up with workshops for further exploration [1]. For more information about the top projects follow the links below:

Global Challenges at the Stockholm School of EconomicsThis partnership with the school of economics added curriculum programs that study global risks [3]. The goal of this partnership is to give future leaders fundamental insights into these threats to understand how to create better collaboration with economic development to alleviate these risks. This program is planned for a minimum of ten years, starting in 2016 to include approximately 3,000 students [1]. Earth StatementThe GCF has partnered with the Earth League to create the Earth Statement to address the current state of climate change [4]. The statement provides a list of 8 essential elements toward climate action that world leaders can help to address. The Earth League is still in the process of fully analyzing and making a final statement on the matter [1, 4].

Case presentations were made by authors and community leaders followed by facilitated discussions among participants. A  panel discussion  of citizen-led sustainable change featured several leaders in the field and forum participants were drawn from development practitioners, researchers, policymakers and funders. Thematic discussion groups explored various themes, such as the use of culture as an asset for change and the kind of wealth needed for sustainable development. The innovations marketplace was a networking event, providing attendees with the opportunity to share and learn from community-development experiences. The final plenary was focused on translating learning into action, encouraging participants to reflect on the new knowledge and perspectives offered through the conference, and how they can be applied to their own initiatives.  [6]Haitian Center for Leadership and Excellence  One of Coady’s major collaborative initiatives is the Haitian Center for Leadership and Excellence (Centre Haitien du Leadership et de l’Excellence – CHLE), a committed group of Haitian private, government and community sector leaders inspired by the Coady Institute’s respectful approach to development. They approach development using Coady’s model: building the capacities of the local people and organizations to utilize their strengths and assets to drive their own development.

 Existing at the intersection of art, design and scientific inquiry, the Studio for Extensive Aesthetics (SEA) has been called an artistic research lab, pursuing a multifaceted approach which incorporates traditional scholarly research in collaboration with leading scientists, and artistic works in collaboration with industry, civic organizations, and cultural institutions. The SEA’s goal is to produce art works and research that sparks dialogue about the role of data aesthetics in contemporary culture, rewriting information culture as a collaborative affair. [1]Origins and Development 
 The SEA was established by Amber Frid-Jimenez in 2014 after she was awarded Canada Research Cain in art and design technology. [2]Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 The SEA is directed by Amber Frid-Jimenez, Canada Research Chair in Art, Design and Technology and was founded in 2014 at Emily Carr University of Art and Design. The SEA is funded by the Canada Research Chair Programme, the Canada Foundation for Innovation, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, the British Columbia Knowledge Development Fund and the UBC Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies. [3]Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 SEA takes a transdisciplinary approach to the cultural mechanics and aesthetics of the network and the data produced by it, using artistic and computational means to create experimental platforms, installations, and books. Themes explored through these projects range from the aesthetics and politics of artificial neural networks to feminist media theory. [4]  One area of particular focus is data visualization, described by Frid-Jimenez as “a fundamental tool in advanced societies, which rely on ever-increasing data flows since the transition to the digital era.” [5]  The studio connects student and faculty researchers with international theorists and practitioners through projects ranging from screen-based work to urban-scale installations. [6]The methodology of SEA combines making and theory. An iterative design process, work at the SEA begins moves from preliminary research, to the prototyping and public display of virtual platforms and physical artifacts, to the communication of research results [7]Major Projects and Events Know what projects or events this organization has lead or supported?

 Since its founding in 1924, the Maxwell School at Syracuse University's primary object has been ""to teach good citizenship — to cull from every source those principles, facts, and elements which, combined, make up our rights and duties and our value and distinctiveness as United States citizens"" and to ""train practitioners in public affairs —people who would immediately enter government careers and effect change.""[1] Maxwell believes a multi-disciplinary approach is needed to create innovate policy solutions to new challenges facing the modern world.[2] Maxwell's defining interest in demcratic citizenship is demonstrated through its signature Citizenship and Civic Engagement (CCE), a nationally unique interdisciplinary learning experience that allows students to contribute to the public good while preparing for careers in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors.[3] 
 Origins and Development 
 The Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs opened on October 3, 1924 thanks to a $500,000 grant from Syracuse graduate George Holmes Maxwell.[4]

Maurice Young Centre for Applied Ethics (the Centre)'s mission is to advance research and teaching of applied ethics, conceived as the application of normative methods to core issues in science and technology ethics and policy, organizational ethics, animal welfare, health, the environment, and research ethics. The Centre aims to conduct world-class research in applied ethics and to educate the next generation of applied ethics researchers and practitioners. It has, in part, met the challenges of working in this field by successfully seeking funding for several major research programs and a growing number of graduate and post-doctoral students.[1]  Origins and Development  The Centre was created in 1993 with endowments by W. Maurice Young (LLD) and the Bentall Foundation. [2]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The Centre’s affairs are managed by a Coordinating Committee representing faculty, students and research associates, chaired by the Director of the Centre.[3]  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The Centre approaches other UBC academic and research units from its position as an interdisciplinary academic centre, and from its mission to advance the research agenda of applied ethics. Its students are drawn from a number of departments and units—including Animal Welfare, the Institute for Resources, Environment, and Sustainability, Nursing and Philosophy—and their research and teaching/supervision focuses largely on Medical Genetics, Law, Political Science, Journalism, Forestry, Botany and Computing Sciences. These relationships and the products of their collaborations place the Centre at the forefront of the movement to create “transdisciplinary” research.[4]  Major Projects and EventsBuilding a GE3LS Architecture (2002-2010)Genomics opens up a universe of new possibilities, but also raises many ethical issues that require public debate and scrutiny given Canada’s cultural and regional diversity, and the way new genomic knowledge and applications tend to move societal narratives to new territory. Building a GE3LS Architecture (GE3LS Arc) project was a Genome BC-funded project focused on three primary areas of genome research: food (salmon genomics); Human health (privacy and the use of data banks and blood or tissue sample biobanks); and non-food (forestry genomics). Building on a previously funded project, Democracy, Ethics and Genomics: Consultation, Deliberation and Modelling, GE3LS Arc used consultation methods and computer-mediated technologies to develop an understanding of how people make decisions and their perspectives on genomics research and biotechnology related to human health, food and the environment. The project set out to answer three questions: What social norms do Canadians use to make judgements about genome research and applications (how do Canadians make moral decisions about a policy)? What are the leading moral perspectives on genomics (and what makes different judgements understandable)? And finally, what is the relevance for policy development and implementation (how are worldviews and norms incorporated into policy)? Through its various deliberative public engagements and research projects, the project helped to support dialogue among scientists, policy makers and the public and contributed to the creation of genome-related policy that accurately reflects and responds to public concerns.[5]  Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

Please help us veryify its content.Mission and Purpose 
 The mandate of the Office is to ""support all City activities and projects through public consultation and engagement. The Office of Public Engagement will ensure that there is consistency and transparency in sharing information with citizens about City projects"". 
 The City of Winnipeg Project Management Manual defines Public Engagement as a process, involving communication and interaction between the City of Winnipeg and its residents that serves to inform and involve the public, and uses public input to make better decisions. The purpose of engaging the public is to achieve decisions that are sensitive and responsive to community values and concerns. 
 Origins and Development 
 In 2014, a new public budget consultation process was implemented in Winnipeg which encouraged citizens to provide feedback through public workshops, an on-line survey, a telephone survey, written submissions or by e-mail. This work was contracted out to a consulting rm which was generally perceived to have conducted an ineffective process with few shifts in spending as a result of community input. The following year another consulting rm conducted a similar exercise which included a series of town hall meetings and an online survey with the results ultimately not reported to council or released to the public. This rocky start to formal budget consultations in the city caught the attention of the incoming Mayor Brian Bowman (assumed office at the end of 2014), who promised improved public consultation for both the budget and other projects. To this end, Bowman established an office of Public Engagement in 2015 with a mandate to support all City activities and projects through public consultation and engagement. The Office of Public Engagement will ensure that there is consistency and transparency in sharing information with citizens about City projects.

The Ethelo algorithm was developed by Richardson to enable fair outcomes in complex multi-stakeholder negotiations.  Ethelo’s first major use case was PartyX’s BC Mandate campaign, during British Columbia election in April 2013. Ethelo evaluated more than 200,000 combinations of policy positions to create a consistent platform that would receive the fairest distribution of support from voters across the political spectrum.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Ethelo is comprised of two entities: Ethelo Decisions - a technology company dedicated to helping organizations focus collective intelligence to make the best decisions more quickly - and Ethelo Democracy - a non-profit society dedicated to a more effective, citizen-engaged democracy. Ethelo Decisions undertakes commercial projects to fund the development of the Ethelo technology, which is provided to Ethelo Democracy and its partners for the cost of hardware.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Ethelo uses an algorithm to combine decision parameters such as options, issues, criteria, constraints, influence, and fairness from there build a space of potential outcomes that are are evaluated and ranked according to aggregated analysis of the participants. It finds outcomes with high average support and low variance in satisfaction among participants  Ethelo is an extension of morphological analysis. It is compatible with and a complement to processes such as conjoint analysis, the Monte Carlo Method and decision trees. It incorporates a novel approach to liquid democracy using trust networks  Ethelo was granted the U.S. patent for the underlying algorithms in 2017. Ethelo plans to release the algorithm under an Affero Copyleft GPL with a public Application Programming Interface.  Major Projects and Events  Ethelo’s largest client is the Canadian government, which uses the platform for making internal decisions, gathering constituent feedback, and assessing risk.  Other uses include:  In 2014, the South Surrey-White Rock electoral district in British Columbia used Ethelo to gather input from residents about how to make the community a better place to live.  The Springtide Collective 9 partnered with Ethelo in 2015 on the Make Democracy Better project, an effort to increase voter turnout and engagement in Nova Scotia.  In 2015, Canadian credit union Vancity used Ethelo to collect input on from its members about how to achieve social and economic goals.  Roslyn Fuller used Ethelo as part of her 2016 Irish General Election campaign. She ran a month long project to capture voter priorities in advance of the election  Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

Please help us verify its content.Mission and Purpose 
 Involved's mission is to increase civic engagement by finding a way to reach the average citizen. Involved offers micro-polling software for government, allowing representatives to send out single question surveys through their mailing list, social media, and their app. Residents can respond in one click, leave private comments and share with friends and neighbors. The ease of use and focus on a single issue results in surveys with the potential to go viral. 
 Origins and Development 
 Involved was founded in February, 2017 by three seniors at Boston University. After graduating, Involved participated in the BU Summer Accelerator and ran a pilot program of their mobile app with four representatives from the Massachusetts State House. 
 Following the pilot program, Involved opened up to all Massachusetts municipalities and successfully raised $56,502 from a crowdfunding campaign. During this time, Involved was struggling to gain adoption for the mobile application and pivoted to include integrating directly with existing mailing lists and adding share functionality. This led to a breakthrough in adoption, response rates, and virality of questions. 
 Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 Involved is run by co-founders Caleb McDermott and Jacob Dansey. 
 The organisation was awarded $11,000 prize money and grants from Boston University and has since sourced $56,502 through equity crowdfunding from friends and family on Netcapital.

Origins and Development  The Irish Parliament introduced and passed the Resolution Approving Establishment of the Citizens’ Assembly in July 2016 [4] and the body convened for the first time in October of the same year.[2]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The Irish Citizens Assembly was established through Parliamentary (Dáil Éireann) Resolution as an independent body with a Government-appointed Chairperson. The rules and procedures of the Assembly written and agreed up by all 99 members and Chairperson during the inaugural meeting.[6]  The Assembly is funded through a public tendering process. According to the Assembly’s website, various tasks requiredfor the Assembly’s establishment and continued operation were posted to the ‘eTenders’ website. The following contracts were awarded:“RED C Research and Marketing Ltd were appointed on 22 August 2016 to  provide a representative sample of 99 members of the public and substitutes  for the Citizen's Assembly.  The Grand Hotel, Malahide, was selected as the  venue for the meetings of the Assembly.Richard Jolly TV Ltd/Switch New Media was selected to  provide the filming/live broadcasting and streaming of the Assembly’s meetings.Q4PR was selected to provide  media liaison services  for the Assembly.  Roomaxx Ltd was selected to provide  facilitation and note-taking services  for the Assembly.  Beatrice.ie Translation &amp; Tour Guiding Services was selected to  provide translation services  for the Assembly.” [5]Other expenses such as salaries, office administration, and the reimbursement of costs incurred while attending meetings are paid by the Government.[5]  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The number and frequency of the Assembly's meetings on each topic is decided by the Chair and is subject to change seemingly at any time during the process although extensions are subject to approval by the Legislature. Decisions regarding the scheduling, number, and frequency of meetings and meeting events is dependent on several factors such as the availability of guests, the number of public submissions, and the time needed by Members to adequately deliberate and decide on the issue(s).[1] For example, alterations to the schedule were made in March 2017 because “the original schedule had only a four week break from the end of the [first topic] to the weekend on [the second] and then only 3 weeks between that and the [next], the Chair felt that such a relentless pace would be unfair on the members, unmanageable for the Secretariat and most importantly would not allow sufficient time to prepare for the other topics.”[1]  Major Projects and Events1st Sitting on the Eighth Amendment2nd Sitting on Rsponding to an Ageing PopulationAnalysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

 The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation's philanthropic approach flows directly from the ethos and values of their founders. They are committed to acting honestly and with integrity, in accordance with the law and the highest standards of practice, and to treating all those with whom they deal fairly and respectfully.[1] Their mission is to support efforts to advance education for all, preserve the environment, improve lives and livelihoods in developing countries, promote the health and economic well-being of women, support vibrant performing arts, strengthen Bay Area communities and make the philanthropy sector more effective.[2] 
 The Hewlett Foundation seeks to acheive their charitable goals by: Bringing about meaningful, socially beneficial change in the fields in which they work. 
 Pursue change by tackling defined problems in a pragmatic, nonpartisan manner. 
 Focus on outcomes in order to maximize the effectiveness of our support. 
 Remain committed to openness, transparency, and learning. 
 Work in a collaborative fashion based on mutual respect; treating grantees, co-funders, and other colleagues as partners in problem-solving 
 Promote the values and practice of diversity, equity, and inclusion in their workforce, culture, and grantmaking. 
 Approach their role in philanthropy and their tresponsibilities to society with humility and respect for others 
 Maintain a lean staff with considerable autonomy; a commitment to simple, flexible procedures; and a cooperative working relationship between the board, staff, and the president, who is the leader of the foundation[3] Origins and Development 
 The Hewlett Foundation was established in 1966 by William and Flora Hewlett who shared a deep, persistent and personal belief in a life of charity and philanthropy.  The Foundation was created to formalize their charitable impulses with a loose charter mandating only a “perpetual existence … as a charitable, religious, scientific, literary or educational foundation for the purpose of promoting the wellbeing of mankind.” 1966 to 1972 are termed the “living room years” of the foundation, when family members met at home and together decided how the Hewlett Foundation could do the most good. In 1972 sons William A. Hewlett and James S. Hewlett joined the board of directors and, in 1974 the foundation hired its first executive director, John May. Under May's direction, the Hewlett Foundation operated as a conservatively managed hybrid of family philanthropy and community trust, focussing on grantmaking through “networks” rather than “categories.” The establishment of David P. Gardner as president in 1993 marked a turning point. Gardner brought both breadth and focus to the programs during a period of rapid growth in the foundation’s assets, which increased to more than $2 billion, and annual grantmaking, which increased from $35 million in 1993 to $84 million in 1998. The foundation broadened its scope of funding, turning from environmental efforts mostly in California, to encompass the entire Western United States and Canada. The foundation also broadened its education funding to emphasize K-12 reform and developed a program on U.S.-Latin American relations. Larry Kramer became president in 2012 and, since that time,  he has sought to maintain continuity with the ethos of Bill and Flora Hewlett. Kramer describes the foundation's current strategy as ""an ongoing conversation with our past—looking at the problems Bill and Flora cared about and the reasons they cared about them, and reshaping our work to remain continuous with those values and concerns in changing circumstances.”[4] 
 Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 The Hewlett Foundation is governed by a board of directors that includes four members of the Hewlett family, and 5-11 other leaders drawn from philanthropy, government, business, education and civil society. Their current president is Larry Kramer.[5]  The foundation is wholly independent of the Hewlett Packard Company and the Hewlett Packard Company Foundation.[6] 
 Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 The Hewletts appproach to philanthropy is grounded in a humanistic philosophy based on faith in the capacity of people to do good and belief in the importance of healthy institutions as a means for doing so.[7]

This activity took place within the scope of consolidation of the Center for Studies in Agroecology and Organic Production (NEA) from the project ""Metropolis in Transition: Implantation of the Nucleus of Studies in Agroecology and Organic Production (NEA / UFMG) in the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte"" (ORNELAS, 2017).*The course was offered torural technical assistance (ATER) employees , both from the public sectorand from civil society organizations. Its purpose was to collectively build a general view of agriculture in the RMBH and to guide ATER by the principles of agroecology. Information about the methodology, objectives and educational processes that guided the construction of the course and drove the sharing of the agroecological knowledge were systematized by the members of AUÊ! (ORNELAS et al, 2017).In that context, those who participated in the course identified the need of a permanent space for meetings and discussions between organizations, social movements, public agencies and researchers so they could continue the discussions and organize collective activities. There were already other processes of articulation of social groups and organizations related to urban agriculture and agroecology in the RMBH, such as the Metropolitan Articulation of Urban Agriculture (AMAU). However, there was a gap regarding the permanent articulation between these initiatives with public managers and researchers.One of the initiatives that contributed to the construction of RUA Metropolitana was the extension project ""Cultivating Another City"", funded by Pro-Rectory of Extension (PROEX) of the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) and carried out by AUÊ! - Studies in Urban Agriculture (IGC / UFMG) during the years 2016 to 2018, which allowed the dedication of scholarship holders to assist in the creation and maintenance of the network, through facilitation, organization and systematization of meetings, reports, documents and photos.Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingCurrently, the network works through an e-mail group and face-to-face meetings, established according to the conditions and needs. More than 200 people representing various groups, organizations and institutions, especially from the RMBH, are part of the RUA e-mail group.Networks can be understood as a structure that involves different actors and organizations united from the establishment and maintenance of common goals.  The power in the networks is shared and the relations tend to be horizontal, allowing different access to symbolic, material or informational power resources(FLEURY, 2005) . The sociotechnical networks are based on the relationship and bond between individuals, who communicate and articulate themselves in the duty of their collective interests. The consistency and conditions of the connections between the actors are decisive for the functioning and objectives of both the individual and the group. The structure of the networks is presented as a way of making the communication and the transfer of information more effective, which strengthens the practices and fosters public policies. In this context, civil society actors cease to be just recipients of public policies, because when they receive important information, they become relevant in the construction of the policies related to quality of life (JESUS ​​et al, 2016).Specializations, Methods and ToolsAmong the actions carried out by RUA Metropolitana are: approaching several actors and organizations from different areas connected by the issues of urban agriculture and agroecology in the RMBH; the exchange of knowledge and experience; collective organization of actions and diverse events on the theme of agriculture and agroecology in the RMBH; social mobilization and partnerships in the construction of projects to access funding opportunities with the objective of strengthening agroecological actions; discussion of laws and draft of laws on agriculture; among others (ORNELAS, 2017)Major Projects and EventsThe events co-held by RUA Metropolitana made it possible to broaden the process of institutional recognition of agricultural activities in the RMBH. For the first time the agricultural issue was the theme of a Metropolitan Conference in 2017. In addition, the network has been constituted as another space to discuss the incorporation of urban agriculture and agroecology in Food Security and Nutrition proposals and territorial restructuring, as well as planning bodies - local groups, public hearings and technical staff.Currently, RUA debates the creation of an integrated and intersectoral action plan for agroecology in RMBH, based on the construction of the Participative Guarantee System**, called Metropolitan SPG. The proposal is to certify the agroecological and organic production through collective farmers and other local social actors, having as principle the social control and a shared responsibility. According to Radomsky (2009), in addition to a possible certification seal, this Participative Guarantee System (SPG) allows the sharing of knowledge and practices, the exchange of seeds and products in reciprocal relations.Analysis and Lessons LearnedRUA Metropolitana presents a significant potential for communication, articulation and exchange of information among male and female farmers, their associations and collectives, social movements, civil society organizations, public institutions and subjects that promote urban agriculture and agroecology, making easier the mobilization, organization and participation in the agroecology demands of RMBH.Publications  See AlsoWebsite: https://aueufmg.wordpress.com/rua-rede-urbana-de-agroecologia-metropolitanaReferencesFLEURY, Sonia.Redes de políticas: novos desafios para a gestão pública.Administração em Diálogo, São Paulo, n. 7, p. 77-89, 2005.JESUS, Marcelo de Souza de.

We believe that be including citizens in the decision-making processes, cities and local governments can increase trust in governments and shape better policies.  Origins and Development  CitizenLab was created in 2015 and is located in Brussels. It has developed a citizen participation platform used by cities, governments and civil organisations which is used to collect and analyse citizen input.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  CitizenLab is a for-profit company based in Belgium. Cities, local government or civil organisations who use the platform purchase a yearly license.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Cities and governments can use the platform to consult citizens on a range of different topics. The platform combines a top down approach (with administrators posting projects that participants can vote for) with a bottom-up approach (citizens can submit ideas, comment on the proposals and debate with one-another).  Another important feature of the platform is its integrated data analysis capability. It has developed Natural Language Processing algorithms which can easily process thousands of unstructured, multi-lingual citizen input. Comments can be automatically classified, clustered and located on a map, making it easy for administrators to see at a glance what topics are being discussed on the platform and how this varies across a city or region.  Major Projects and Events  CitizenLab has worked with over 100 cities and governments, from small Belgian municipalities such as Arlon to major cities like Vancouver, CA.

AMAU actions include: organization of meetings; support to popular initiatives that mobilize small farmers from RMBH; diffusion of agricultural experiences. In addition, the articulation seeks to deepen the political debate on the countryside-city relationship and on the role of agroecology in the construction of a popular project mediated by discussion and participation in the elaboration of public policies and urban planning.Origins and DevelopmentThe AMAU was created in 2004 after the ""Dignity and Life Caravan - Food Security and Urban Agriculture - Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte"". The objective of the caravan was to identify and discuss experiences of urban agriculture and food security carried out by civil society in the state of Minas Gerais. This event arose from the creation of the Minas Gerais Forum on Sustainable Food and Nutrition Security (FMSANS) and the Minas Gerais State Council for Sustainable Food and Nutrition Security (CONSEA-MG) in 1999, which included the participation of the Interchange Network of Alternative Technologies - REDE (ORNELAS, 2017)Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingThe AMAU is structured through the following working commissions: agrobiodiversity; production, marketing and consumption; self-organization of women; and medicinal plants. Its meetings gathered several groups, networks, enterprises, research initiatives and university extension projects, community associations and social movements that presented demands such as: urban and agrarian reform, feminism, healthy food, solidarity based economy, among others. In addition, advisory organizations, researchers and students from different areas also participated (ALMEIDA, 2016).Specializations, Methods and Tools  The focus of this collective is to deepen the political debate on the countryside-city relationship and on the role of agroecology. It focuses on the construction of a popular project mediated by discussion and participation in the elaboration of public policies and urban planning. The main claims and demands are: access to land; access to natural resources; promotion of agroecological production; technical advice with agroecological, popular and gender focus; political training and technical training; outflow and commercialization of production; popular communication; studies and research on agroecology in RMBH; battle against mining; combating pesticides; support to the territorialization of experiences, considering the multiple functions of agriculture (AMAU, 2015).  Major Projects and EventsAmong the organized meetings, it is important to emphasize the celebration of the 10 years of AMAU, held between November 29 and 30, 2014, in the municipality of Mário Campos. From this meeting and the systematization carried out in partnership with AUÊ! - Group of Studies in Urban Agriculture (Institute of Geosciences of the Federal University of Minas Gerais) was collectively prepared a Political Charter that presents ""claims and proposals of actions defined by the AMAU that, besides contributing to the debates, can subsidize the formulation and implementation of programs and public policies aimed at the promotion of agroecology and the strengthening of family agriculture in the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte."" (AMAU, 2015) The meetings and activities carried out by the AMAU allow the creation of dynamics for the exchange of knowledge and practices, and collective training among the people involved, especially for urban small farmers. In addition, in its political letter, drawn up after the 10-year meeting, the debate on the multiple functionalities of agroecology for public policies stands out:The various activities of agroecology permeate other sectors of society performing diverse functions. Among many other activities that generate food, labor and income, agriculture involves the reuse of waste in the production of natural fertilizers, gardening, pruning and urban cleaning, preservation of springs and PPAs, recovery of degraded areas and of areas at risk, the afforestation and permeability of the soil, living pharmacies(medicinal plants) and seedling nurseries, school and pedagogic gardens, raising animals such as chickens, quail, pigs, cattle and rabbits. In view of the importance of the social and environmental function of agricultural practices in the city and in the countryside, it is essential that public authorities support the advance and consolidation of agroecology experiences in the RMBH. Government, private sector and civil society must organize themselves to build public policies to support and promote the production and commercialization of agroecological foods (AMAU, 2015, p.20)The AMAU has a fundamental role in the process of characterization and mapping of the agriculture in the RMBH. In the year 2013, the articulation built a ""Declaration of Participation of the AMAU"" and a collaborative virtual platform to systematize and give visibility to the plural profile of its members and other agriculture-related initiatives. The characterization and mapping of agriculture inspired and guided the performance of AUÊ! - Studies in Urban Agriculture (IGC / UFMG) that continues with the collection of data so that one can understand who are the farmers in the RMBH, how they are organized, who represents them, where and how they produce. Thus, it is believed that it is possible to construct ways of guaranteeing the maintenance of the farmers in the region, either through public policies and urban planning (ORNELAS et al, 2017).Nowadays, AMAU has carried out agroecological workshops and meetings to strengthen its self-organization, such as the conversation circles, the construction of community agroforestry garden and an agroforestry task-force. Of particular note is the Agroecology in the Periphery project, of which AMAU is a partner, whose objective is to promote agroecology in communities located in the outskirts of the city, mainly in urban land occupations of RMBH. This project works through training workshops, joint efforts and exchanges focused on guaranteeing the right to sustainable cities.Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

To build a social movement to engage citizens and the political system in creating a democratic Canberra.  Origins and Development  The Canberra Alliance grew out of a series of “Kitchen Table Conversations” held in Canberra by SEE-Change in 2014 which identified many issues of concern to participants who believed they were being inadequately addressed by governments.  Issues included the high-speed rail link, food production, housing availability, fairer taxation, refugees, environmental regulation, overseas aid, public transport and climate change.  A common thread in conversations was the failure of government to protect the common good.  The Canberra Alliance was formed by some of the participants from these conversations, with the aim to develop strategies to make the views of members available to decision-makers, and bring the power of the people to bear on government decision making through various participatory and deliberative democracy methods.

Please help usverify its content.Mission and Purpose""ManaBalss"" (  My Voice)is a Latvian grassroots NGO creating tools for better civic participation in decision-making processes. Its flagship project is ManaBalss.lv - a public participation platform where Latvian citizens (age 16+) using strong authorization tools can submit and sign legislative initiatives to improve policy on the national and municipal level. Once 10’000 signatures are gathered online, the initiative is submitted to elected representatives for a hearing.Since 2011, from the 38 initiatives reaching the decision - a final vote in the legislator, 26 have been approved and have changed laws or normative acts. Additional 16 initiatives currently are in the review process in the parliament.Origins and Development  ManaBalss.lv, a social initiative framework similar to  Avaaz.org  and  Change.org , aims to let people bring their ideas into the agenda initiatives for parliaments or state institutions. It was launched in Latvia at the start of July, 2011. It stands out with its user-friendly interface and integrated functionality for all involved parties — the users, administrators and the target group (decision makers).  It started like a side project by a group of colleagues brainstorming about their country. They noticed that even though Latvians are considered to be politically very inactive and reluctant to engage with anything, they actually are the contrary – they have done the Baltic Way, the Latvian Song and Dance Festival every 4 years, and the annual Big Cleanup.[1][2] What is interesting, is that Latvians do all those things voluntarily, nobody is paid for them. So, the group of colleagues concluded that Latvians  are  a nation of active citizens after-all, but they are disenchanted with the political system and they feel that they have no say, no voice, and no power. That's how that group of colleagues thought up ManaBalss: its creation would let every individual and every organisation get heard, gather like-minded people, and show the public need to authorities and get their ideas done!  Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingDuring the years operational costs of ManaBalss.lv have been covered by micro-donations, most commonly from 0.5 to 5 EUR. It is one of the drivers to promote active population engagement and high quality standards for the publications.Specializations, Methods and Tools  The organization's unique results are due to four basic principles that the ManaBalss.lv creators developed over a 12-month period of research and planning:Development of crowdsource initiatives  — Authors of new initiatives are given council by a network of voluntary experts. Their advice helps create thought-out and useful initiatives from the representatives of the people.100 percent legitimacy  — The framework interacts with Latvia’s Internet banks, providing a free and reliable identity check. Saeima members can be absolutely sure that the number of petitioners is a real representation of the civic will. Additionally, the list of supporters can be compared to the national voters’ register. Personal data accessed by the ManaBalss.lv framework is completely protected; its creators consulted with the best Latvian hackers on the matters of Internet safety.Initiative tracking  — The framework has the built-in ability to allow the media or NGOs (non-government organizations) to report on the initiatives’ progress. This pushes participants to follow through on their commitment, and helps them garner more votes if greater support for a particular initiative is necessary.Built for the user  — The creators worked with leading marketing and technology experts in Latvia to create the ultimate synthesis of functionality and form and an interface that’s attractive and easy to use. Website http://manabalss.lv/ scores high on both functionality and user interface quality.Major Projects and EventsKnow what projects or events this organization has lead or supported?

We develop and disseminate good practices, create tools to simplify facilitation of social activities, conduct social research, we also train and develop educational materials.  Most of the projects and initiatives taken upon by the Shipyard Foundation concentrate in three areas:civic participation &amp; public engagement,  social innovations,  research &amp; consulting.Origins and Development  Shipyard Foundation was established in 2009 by the Foundation for Social and Economic Initiatives, the Polish-American Freedom Foundation and the Klon/Jawor Association.  For over 10 years, we have been creating and supporting effective solutions to social challenges, involving citizens in deciding on public matters and helping organizations and local governments to plan and implement social activities.  We develop and disseminate good practices, create tools to simplify facilitation of social activities, conduct social research, we also train and develop educational materials.  The effects of our activities are used by e.g.: seniors, students and teachers, citizens, activists and local government officials from all over Poland.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Shipyard Foundation is managed by 5 board members elected for a three-year term by the Council. The board members oversee the entirety of the organisation’s operation. The Council is composed of 8 people serving on a voluntary basis. Shipyard’s staff consists of 35 people and its work is supported by volunteers (about 25 people every year).  Major Projects and EventsParticipation Practitioners’ Fora (2014-)Since 2014 we have been organizing annual networking events, which gather over 200 people (civic participation practitioners) from different Polish and foreign cities. They are open to all who have knowledge and experience in the implementation of various participatory processes (or who want to gain and develop them).  By organizing Fora we want to enable participation practitioners to get to know other people dealing with this subject and create a space for the exchange of thoughts and experiences.  More:  https://partycypacjaobywatelska.pl/forum/Public hearings on the National Resilience and Recovery Plan (2021)At the beginning of 2021, in reaction to the way the Polish government conducted consultations on the so-called National Resilience and Recovery Plan, together with 1000 other organizations, we called for their extension and inclusion of civil society in the work on this document. Then, together with our key partner (National Federation of Polish NGOs), we persuaded the ministry responsible for the consultations to organize the largest series of public hearings in the history of Poland. There were a total of 11 public hearings on the National Resilience and Recovery Plan with over 460 speakers (from civil society, local governments, trade unions, companies etc.), watched by a total of over 20,000 people. The European Civic Forum awarded us the Civic Pride Award for initiating and organizing the hearings.Climate Assembly in Warsaw (2020)Together with two other NGOs from Warsaw (Field of Dialogue Foundation and Civis Polonus Foundation), we organized a citizens' assembly on energy efficiency and renewable energy sources (RES). Due to COVID, we conducted the whole process on-line.  90  randomly selected  residents of Warsaw took part in the assembly.  We invited them to 8 on-line meetings, 5 of them were obligatory. Others took place on weekdays evenings and were aimed at additional experts’ speeches, Q&amp;A sessions and technical issues. They learned about the  energy efficiency and RES usage and decided on what measures should be taken at the city level to increase them.Civic councils on education (2019)In 2019, when the outbreak of the greatest strike of teachers and education workers in the history of Poland happened, we launched a nationwide campaign of local civic councils, during which people could talk about the reasons for the strike and together reflect on what changes they expect in the Polish education system. From April to June 2019, 150 grass-root civic councils took place all over Poland. Approximately 4000 people (teachers, parents, students) took part in them.Citizens' Assembly in Lublin (2018)School Participatory Budgeting in Warsaw (2018)PublicationsWarsaw Climate Assembly reportSchool Participatory Budgeting GuidelinesCivic councils on education reportDirection: Citizens' Assembly.

Every member is the bearer of a particular gaze and perspective, bringing their own unique values, interests, and principles. This complexity often makes us feel helpless when bitter conflicts seem to trigger autonomously, grow rapidly, and become incurable. [1]  Thus, there is a great need for ways of meeting based on mutual recognition and respect; for decision-making and problem-solving methods that are at the same time constructive of common ground and capable of expanding everyone's choice and initiative. In other words, there is an urgent need for more facilitative leadership, capable of promoting more creativity and more dialogue. It is Ascolto Attivo's belief that a participatory planning and/or training experience has a positive outcome only when at least some of the participants feel they have acquired these skills and are able to practice them in their daily life, to improve them, and spread them. This is the mission and goal of Active Listening, the main criterion for self-evaluation of their interventions. [1]  Origins and Development  Ascolto Attivo Srl originated in 2008 on the initiative of Marianella Sclavi, a pioneer in Italy of the theories and techniques of Active Listening, Creative Conflict Management, Facilitation, and Participatory Planning. Along with Marianella Sclavi, Agnese Bertello and Stefania Lattuille are members of Ascolto Attivo.  Ascolto Attivo Srlhas designed and conducted some of the most important participatory planning paths implemented in Italy over the last few years,  contributing to disseminating good participatory practices in the country.

The most recent projects have concerned common goods, co-housing, and construction of infrastructure or plants. Ascolto Attivo Srl have dealt with, and are particularly happy with, a very delicate issue, such as post-earthquake reconstruction, with a project conducted by SOS—School of Sustainability in Camerino, in the Marche region.  In 2018, they curated, together with a multidisciplinary staff coordinated by Mario Cucinella, the participatory paths for the realization of the projects of Archipelago Italia, presented at the XVI Architecture Biennale in Venice.

Among its mission, its valuesacceptance, open mindedness, collaboration and coordination.The organization is structured arounddiscussion, the documentation ofoutcomes,the diffusion of this documentation to other organizations, and working on projects that include and draw inspiration from horizontality.  Origins and Development  Following the 2010-2011 uprising, the leftist political militant, Gilbert Naccache, started a series of political debates with newly minted Tunisian citizens. These debates, held between 14 January 2011 and 20 March 2011, paved the way for the birth of a movement called “Le Manifeste de 20 Mars” when a group of citizens left Naccache’s audience and moved to the side of the debates to discuss the future of post-‘revolutionary’ Tunisia. The movement’s mission consisted of reflecting on the contours and directionality of Tunisia’s nascent democratic experiment, defining the main actors and their goals, and establishing a public debate over the writing of a civic constitution. A movement consisting of thousands of citizens participated in debates and conferences to “let us write our constitution,” as it was called, across the country, and most notably in Tunis, Sousse, Nabeul, Beja, Kairouan, Gabes, Sfax, Bizerte, and Djerba. The, later known as “Doustourna” (Destourna, 2015), culminated in the sit-ins of Mahdia (22-24 July 2011), which brought together around 350 citizens, associations, lawyers, and legal experts to draft a civic constitution that was later published for public consumption with the aim of garnering feedback and suggestions from a ‘bottom-up’ approach.  During these initial debates in Mahdia, a group of youth encountered a misunderstanding with the larger group that required some attention. “We were spontaneously put together as a small community of around 30 people sharing the same view about work/organization mechanisms and ways of expression. We had later given it the name ‘T7arek’” (Interview with Olfa Khaled).  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  As a horizontal organization, T7arek resists vertical power structures, However, in order to register the organization as a legal entity, assigning ‘roles’ was necessary. As Olfa Khaled noted: “At some point after the revolution, when social movements’ spontaneity ended, getting an official authorization became necessary. However, our organizational style was distinct from the government ready-made framework for associations. We needed to legitimize everything in order to provide a premise for our activities and avoid trouble. We created the association to facilitate our social activism…We did not find a legal framework which may legitimizeourpresence a sa social movementin the street.That was the reasonwhy we createdourassociation.  Tharek was officially registered as an association in the Official Journal of the Republic of Tunisia (JORT) on 19 June 2012. With the aforementioned stipulated, its official leadership positions are as follows:  1.President: Salah Jmour  2.Vice President: Amine Ben Salah  3.Treasurer: Oussama Abdeljaouad  4.Vice Treasurer: Haifa Jmour  T7arekis founded on a number of principles (anti-racism) and guidelines. Membership is open to all those who accept inclusivity. Furthermore, anyinformation and documentation that is relevant to horizontality must be equally shared and be madeaccessible to everyone.T7arek drew inspiration from and was in contact with international organizations who used horizontality as an organizing ethos, such as Podemos and Occupy. As one of the members of T7arek  put it:  “Horizontality functions like the body/heart mechanism does. The heart contains all the vital elements of the organization such as documentation, drafting/editing, finance, law and communication, while the body consists of what is functional/operational: different groups, whether cultural, artistic, environmental, etc. These [smaller] groups are completely independent and whenever they need help in a specific area then the role of the heart is to intervene and assist. They are autonomous to the point where if one group decides to function vertically internally, it is totally up to them to do so, and we don’t decide on how they should operate” (Personal interview with Olfa Khaled).  The central heart is therefore responsible for delegating responsibilities into smaller hearts [technical committees] of about 5 people, where each is responsible for overseeing specific tasks (financial, legal, communication, etc.). If one of these smaller committees expands in membership, then it is divided it into sub-committees, each working on a specific task. Each of these functions independently and once it fulfills its mission, it returns to the heart with the outcomes (propositions) and the final decision is presented to the body for approval. In the case of objections, convincing arguments premised on evidence and facts must be presented. “There is no “no” for the sake of objecting. At this level, the representative of the group (heart) who attended larger meeting (body) should go back to discussion with the group and come back with an alternative proposition. Each committee (heart) has a coordinator in addition to a general coordinator of the whole body. Once the body coordinator liaises with all the hearts’ coordinators and gathers all final-team propositions regarding a specific issue, a general decision should be either approved or rejected in a big assembly” (Ibid).  Thus, while decisions are takenhorizontally,functionally there is some modicum of verticality: a ‘leader du moment’ that is responsible for overseeing any given action by the committee. The leader, however, is only in her position temporarily. Leadership must also rotate frequently.  The movement wasinspired bylarge national and international social movements like Occupy and Podemos, and it draws inspiration from biology(i.e. how dolphinsfunction in their natural environment).  Specializations, Methods and Tools  T7arek passes their model of horizontalityto other Tunisian groups which worked on(informal) politics, art andcultural activities,intellectualproperty,andenvironmental issues(specifically issue of “gas de schiste”). Notably influences include  Manich Msema7  and Fech Nestanaou. The group also works oncultural andartistic projects in Franceas a continuation of what has been accomplished in T7arek, Tunis.

When a country is democratized, it typically starts out as a polyarchy, as it is the first stage of democratic development. A polyarchy allows a country’s political elites to continue to govern the country through political parties, albeit with greater democratic legitimacy due to universal suffrage. However, the political elites and their parties do not want to relinquish power and hand that over to the citizens, which is the hallmark of real democracy. Instead, they want to concentrate as much power as possible to themselves. The competition between the political elites, and the political parties they work through, therefore obstructs democratic development after the first polyarchic step. Since Folkstyret is a democratic party that acts as a direct channel between the citizens and the political power, the citizens themselves can, in general elections, decide how much direct influence they want and how much they want to delegate to the political elites and political parties. Citizens have the opportunity not only to distribute power between the various political elites but also to distribute power between the political elites and themselves. In practice it is a version of sortition within a Bicameral System where the citizens themselves regulate the balance of power between the sortition chamber and elected chamber. This makes democratic development possible beyond polyarchy. This allows for political decisions beyond the legitimacy of the polyarchy. Democracy can begin to grow in depth so that it concludes more in every society and is not limited to spreading across the surface of the planet.  Protect the existing democracy  The political power play between the various political elites means that the political parties, in their quest for power, can be attracted to acquire help from undemocratic parties. This gives undemocratic parties political influence. Democratic parties use their influence to dismantle democracy. Anyone who wants to get rid of the most basic and undeveloped form of democracy we have in Sweden (the polyachy) can do so in just a couple of years. First through a simple majority decision in the Riksdag (175 votes agains 174), then a quick extra election and a new vote in the Riksdag with the same result. Then democracy is gone. Since Folkstyret is the only party that, because of its own constitution, cannot contribute to abolishing any individual freedoms, Folkstyret is the only guarantor that democratic development will not continue backwards as it has done in the last decade. (Down 5% according to the Economists Democracy Index.)  Curb populism  Populism is growing in the gap that arises between citizens and political elites. The populist claims to be the sole interpreter of the will of the real people. Instead of giving voice to a silent majority, the populist almost always expresses the views of a very loud minority. With Folkstyret, the citizens, with every vote in Parliament, can see the opinions of their own representatives in all the social issues that is decided on. No populist can with any credibility claim that the people wants something else when everyone can see the actual result with their own eyes. This removes the basis of populism.  Let each new generation conquer democracy and make it their own  There is a wealth of democratic institutions, but the most important one is missing. The one who constantly includes the citizens in the political decisions and lets the citizens speak. It is through participation that each new generation can conquer democracy and make it their own. We are learning by doing. Every citizen learns how democracy works by being a part of it and it is through participation that each one of us can shape our own democratic values. Democracy must be reborn in every generation, education is its midwife and Folkstyret can be the institution that constitutes the maternity ward.

After organizing cleanups for several years they had come to realize that it is not enough to cleanup the country every year but it is also important to keep it clean.That meant changing waste management laws and that in turn meant going against powerful corporate interests of global utility companies and their lobby. So they came up with a system that would decentralise power. No center of power means noone to lobby. Or more precisely, if everyone has power, it means everyone has to be lobbied for a decision, but that makes it much more transparent and can be publicly countered.So they dreamt up an information system for making collaborative decisions, based on good arguments where everyone's word carried equal weight. Where votes could be delegated in swift and smart ways. A system that would decentralise power, taking it away from political parties and institutions and sharing it with all members of a community, city or country. That system came to be known as Toru (Pipeline in the beginning) and Citizen OS later.2013 -- Idea is born at the Let's Do It!

A key belief of CityHive is that the youth have innovative energy that they would like to harness in order to combat the stated issues, raise awareness and allow young people to become engaged in a democratically political landscape.  This organisation envisions a city where youth actively partake directly in the planning and decision making processes that affect their city. By doing this, CityHive allows young people to feel empowered and involved, and gives them a sense of duty, thereby enabling them to have a direct impact on their city. All of this is ultimately designed to realise the vision of a 'sustainable, inclusive and liveable' Vancouver, somewhere youth will want to live and stay.[1]  Origins and Development  Veronica Bylicki and Tessica Truong, co-founders of CityHive, envisaged development of a symbiotic relationship between residents aged 16-30 and institutions to create a more sustainable and engaging relationship with the city. Tessica Truong was inspired to create CityHive due to reconstruction in her childhood residential neighborhood that made the area exclusive to a small community and closed off from non-residents.[2] Her concerns that the area's youth were not able to contribute to the planning and decision making processes inspired her to create a forum called 'Plan-it Earth'. She experimented with programs and initiatives to create a more inclusive city until she co-founded CityHive.[2]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  CityHive was co-founded and co-directed in 2017 by Veronica Bylicki and Tessica Truong. The reason for creating this organisation was to bridge the disparity between the youth and institutions in which they reside. This organisation receives a wide range funding from sponsors such as:City of Vancouver  Downtown Vancouver  Generation Squeeze  Real Estate Foundation (British Columbia)  Landlord BC  Landlord Registry (from Landlord BC)The exact amount of money donated is not stated. However, it is clear that CityHive has a healthy relationship with many organisations that sponsor it, allowing projects to be realised with the goal of Vancouver becoming a more democratic and inclusive city.MembershipOne of the driving forces of this organisation since its inception is called '30Network'. This is a public 'think-and-do-tank' for thirty civic-minded leaders under thirty who come together to learn about civic issues affecting Vancouver. Participants are selected after sending off a Civic Engagement form. Applicants are hand-picked from a range of social backgrounds and a diverse scope of experiences. Even though CityHive does not claim that the selected applicants are representative of Vancouver, it is clear that they value diversity and multiplicity amongst the chosen leaders, allowing the network to be more socially representative.  Participants for other events are sometimes selected by project leaders if they are presumed to be experts or advocates of a particular viewpoint, but otherwise are open to the public. Some projects such as 'Bring Your Own Suitcase' rely on migrants to show up.  Specializations, Methods and ToolsPublic engagement events  Debates and  deliberationCampaigningCivic EducationMajor Projects and Events  After being selected, the group of thirty applicants come together and discuss issues such as environmental/energy problems, homelessness, and education quality. They then consider ways to solve these issues by creating projects that are sponsored and funded to catalyse success.Ice Breakers- depolarising politicsThis project aims to foster dialogue between polarised groups in light-hearted and enjoyable social settings. This could be between, for example, drivers and cyclists or teachers and students.  It works by first selecting a polarising issue/topic that will spark deliberation and engagement amongst the public. Then, experts and advocates on each side of the debate are invited to speak at the events, allowing for a fairer representation of each viewpoint. The last stage opens the events to the public to gauge their thoughts, ideas, and viewpoints. Once everyone has gathered together, a team initiates dialogue by tweeting provocative or polarising viewpoints to encourage communication, whilst also being the ones to facilitate the conversation.  Other forms of Ice Breakers also are being carried out. One event saw a giant 'Jenga' game being played which let the public engage in differing opinions to depolarise motorists from cyclists. This allowed for groups to empathise with the struggles of a group with a differing view, bringing people together.MentAlly'MentAlly' is directed at the wider public and then the millennial generation in Vancouver who may have mental health issues or barriers preventing them from voting in elections. 'MentAlly' seeks to boost the confidence of these individuals and give them a sense of autonomy to enable them to vote in local, provincial or federal elections. Leaders who are working on this project planned to train volunteers and begin pre-voting services in the months of July, August and September of 2018. In the Month of October 2018, the team at MentAlly planned to hand out 'toolkits' to voting stations.[3] This project seeks to remove mental health as a barrier to political participation.Count Me InThe 'Count me In' project aims to boost civic engagement of people of the ages 24-35 who are reported to be the bracket of people with the lowest turnout in Canada. 'Count Me In' takes a newer approach by targeting people in their workplaces and third places to encourage them to participate in elections.  There are said to be three layers to this project. The first layer will be the ambassador team themselves who will be responsible for disseminating information to their friends and family, the immediate social circle around them. The second layer come from the people in those workplaces whilst the third layer comes into play by partnering with coffee shops or dining establishments.[4]  Public attention is grasped through items such as posters, banners or board signs displaying politically provocative slogans/messages to encourage and elicit political thought and therefore political engagement.[4] Texting services will also be used to remind and persuade people to vote, as most younger people nowadays are online and have mobile devices.Bring Your Own Suitcase (BYOS)Those in charge of this project looks at understanding, tolerance and acceptance of migrants in Vancouver. The 'Bring Your Own Suitcase' project is an interactive series of events where residents and migrants exchange a wealth of knowledge for mutual benefit. In these events, migrants bring an item which they first brought with them when arriving in Vancouver. Project leaders of BYOS suggest that here, community building achieved through storytelling.[5] In addition to this, it has been said that when you do not recognise the qualities and assets that people bring with them, it can make them feel alienated within the community that they are living in.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  CityHive was founded in 2017 and launched many projects which have changed and evolved over time to cover a wider range of issues. In 2017, projects looked dominantly on housing issues such as the barriers first-time renters face in Vancouver in 'Housed Up'. On the other hand, 'Empty Nests' looked at trying to promote healthy relationships between renters and rentees. Since then, CityHive has come to focus more on other social issues such as education, understanding of migrants and attempting to depolarise groups within society. This shows that CityHive is actively trying to address a multitude of issues that Vancouverites face.  Although CityHive, and more specifically, the '30Network' community has shown valiant efforts to increase the democratic inclusivity of Vancouver, there are still elements which could be improved.  Firstly, thirty people do not seem like a lot of people if CityHive is trying to be inclusive. There should be larger teams and more of them. This would allow for a greater participation and involvement of youths, working together simultaneously to create a more democratic Vancouver. There may also be some form of unconscious bias when selecting applicants since they are handpicked, which means that not all applicants have an equal chance of becoming part of the '30Network' initiative. As Keren and Teigen suggest, people often look at stereotypes and heuristics unknowingly because they are unable to analyse information completely.[6] These cognitive shortcuts, as described by Keren and Teigen mean that people often overlook information and come to premature conclusions.[6] This means that those who are picking candidates to join the '30Network' could unknowingly pass unfair and biased judgement on applicants due to gender or social background. It has also been said that people are swayed not only by negative but also positive stereotypes,[7] perhaps giving people unwarranted advantages.  Accessibility may also be an issue for people wanting to get involved. These events and programs not all over Vancouver and are limited to the city alone at best. This may prevent many people from getting involved with their projects and limiting the amount of exposure and popularity the non-profit organisation gets through 'word of mouth'. Because of this, it might not cater to sections of the Vancouver/ Canada that need to be encouraged the most to engage civically and participate politically. Therefore, it is likely that they are operating in areas where there are relatively high levels of civic engagement in the first place.  Despite funding from multiple organisations, with smaller projects still trying to raise upwards of $1000, and this may not be enough to expand initiatives across the city. Money is always an issue, especially for upcoming organisations like CityHive. The lack of funding or periods of lower donations from sponsors may halt the quality of projects and not allow for the best execution of programs designed to encourage people in civic engagement. If this is solved by cutting costs, people may ignore or dismiss projects if they are not seen as good quality. Funding may also be an issue since CityHive is a non-profit organisation, and a drop in funding may cripple the organisation.  Migrants may not feel comfortable out of fear of judgement, prejudice or discrimination. Despite projects such as 'Bring Your Own Suitcase' trying to abolish just that, it still may be hard for migrants to show up if they feel uncomfortable revealing themselves if they will be seen as others. This may especially be hard if they have already settled well into the community and have adopted the language, culture or tradition of Vancouver. As previously stated, migrants may be judged based on stereotypes or heuristics[6] and this may prevent real understanding between migrants and other members of the public.  People may be turned off from civic engagement due to texting services. It is clear that  texting (SMS)  is one of the main and most popular forms of communication in recent history. However, this has also increased the number of spam text messages. According to Nagwani, the majority of SMS text messages are now spam.[8] This means that people may be first be deterred from using text messaging services in the first place, but it could also mean that people get frustrated by constant text messages reminding them to vote. This frustration and annoyance could lead to the opposite effect of people not wanting to go and vote. In addition, it is very easy for text messages to be ignored from 'silent' functions on phones, especially if people are at work. Encouraging civic engagement via text messaging may also not work if people's devices are not in areas of sufficient signal. It is clear that texting services are dependent on a lot of factors and thus may not be the best method of trying to increase civic engagement.  There was little media coverage, but it was positive. Ducklow praises CityHive for empowering the youth and allowing them to engage in key decision making process in Vancouver.[9]  PublicationsDoes this organization publish reports, studies, or other media?

Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingKnow how this organization operates internally? Help uscomplete this section!Specializations, Methods and Tools  The organization pays high attention to citizen participation and social accountability. To elaborate, they focus on methods and tools which boost citizen participation, participatory evaluation of public policies and services,  participatory budgeting , community governance and development, and more.  For the past eight years, the Participation Center has devoted itself to several fields to achieve their vision, involving urban planning, a right to education, and tax inequality.Urban planningSome of the actions taken include:Implementing  participatory planning projects in urban communities , thereby mobilizing citizens to express their voices on public affairs, especially in public services.  Capacity building on community governance to help NGOs, community based organizations, and local governments learn how to mobilize local residents,  map  community resources and reallocate those to proper places.Major Projects and EventsRight to educationPolicy research and innovative education service models were piloted in Participation Center projects to alleviate the education gap between rural migrant and urban children, especially as it relates to compulsory education. Migrant children enrolled in urban migrant primary schools as well as kindergartens were provided with better educational resources.  For migrant children, the Participation Center worked with participatory approaches to hold the business and public sectors more accountable regarding rural migrant children's compulsory right to education. Further, they offered a series of courses on faculty training and management, making up its absence in the school curriculum.  For the migrant community care center, the Center's focus is early childhood education service provision models exploration, such as social franchise and impact bonds. They also provide faculty training and management, improving teaching qualities and exploring unified and standardized norms of school management for rural migrant children’s community care centers.Tax and inequalityThis area focus involves the conducting of research on tax-related issues, including the current situation of illicit financial flows in China, and tax avoidance of multinational corporations, among other issues.  Participation Center organizes  workshops  and visit activities concerning tax-related issues, presenting basic knowledge, hot topics, scholar’s ideas, international experience or views for domestic social organizations, media and academics.

GPACE mobilizes funding, coordinates, and builds the capacity of these member organizations. GPACE’s vision is to achieve “an environment where women, youth and children are empowered and participate in issues that affect them and are able to contribute positively to the socio-economic and political development of country.” GPACE strives to respond to these challenges through various projects, where voters are educated on their political rights and how they can hold leaders accountable.Origins and DevelopmentGPACE was founded in 2018 in response to the various challenges that inhibit its growth and implementation. According to Program Officer Kingsley Banda, voter apathy was, and continues to be one of these challenges. In discussing this issue, Mr. Banda stated that GPACE research found that many young people hold the perspective that “we don’t see the need in showing up [to elections], voting for someone who is not there for us, who actually prioritizes his special interests or political party interests at the expense of development initiatives.” Another major issue inhibiting youth participation is what Mr. Banda termed “the big man theory”. Explaining this, he stated that for young people, the expectation in Malawian society is that “whatever an elderly person has said, you cannot dispute that.” He elaborated, “Young people are just like objects. Things are being made for them, decisions are being made for them but they are not involved. They are not effectively participating. Where they have been involved, it’s like maybe they have just been invited to a meeting but they are not empowered to speak and they are not given affirmative actions to make sure that their views are aired out.” Through the implementation of projects to combat the aforementioned challenges, GPACE has successfully increased its membership.Organization Structure, Membership, and FundingGPACE has a overall staff of 21 people. It receives funding from multiple sources, including Unicef, Focusnet, and more.Specializations, Methods and ToolsTo achieve its goals, GPACE implements budget tracking/accountability clubs throughout the world in collaboration with member organizations in their respective countries. Created after the national elections of 2014, these projects were created so that youth can track the expenditure of government officials. As stated by Mr. Banda, “they should be able to track the utilization of the resources because that’s their money...not the government’s.” In order to select participants, GPACE and/or member organizations work with local chiefs to identify capable young people. After this, GPACE trains the young people in how to monitor government spending/budgeting, as well as provides the accountability clubs with the data they need to effectively monitor and evaluate civil sector employees. As Mr. Saka stated, “time and again we are at loggerheads with district councillors because we have presented out something which they have covered [up]...there’s a lot of financial mismanagement.” Regardless, positive changes have been seen as a result of these budget tracking/accountability clubs. For example, we have tried to create an interface or a forum where a member of parliament can meet the citizens and explain things as they are.”  GPACE also fulfills its role as a Secretariat for 1200 organizations across world by organizing an Annual Dissemination Conferences during which all member organizations gather to discuss past and future activities.Major projects and eventsGPACE implements projects in four programmatic areas: Governance and Human Rights, Climate Change and Environmental Management, Health, and Child/Youth Empowerment. For example, with funding from the FOCUSNET Fund), GPACE implements the Citizen AdvocacyProgram. Here, 37 (20 men and 17 women) from member organizations gained skills on how a citizen can effectively participate in district councils for one month, with the hope of empowering them to “effectively participate in local governance issues from the grassroots level.” Mr. Banda proudly stated that, although it was difficult to establish due to government skepticism, “it was the first of its kind in Malawi”. Mr. Banda believed it was of critical importance due to his belief that “part of empowerment is that these young people should be aware of local governance structures, their laws and the processes and the systems”.

The movement employs multiple methods of deliberation and engagement, including activism that takes place primarily online, to offline protesting, community organizing, andpromoting political participation to realize racial justice  .Origins and DevelopmentIssues of violence toward young Black men and institutional racism within the United States’ criminal justice system were heightened with the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old African American, and the subsequent acquittal of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watchcoordinator for his gated community who fatally shot Martin while the young man was visiting his relatives  . News of the event and the people involved circulated quickly online, fueling community tensions and leading to widespread protests and accusations that the United States’ criminal justice system is fundamentally biased against people of color, especially Black males [1].Outraged at Zimmerman's 2013 acquittal of Martin's death, Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi created the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag across online social networks. Remaining largely unnoticed for several months, the hashtag was finally taken up by millions of Internet users as the murders of unarmed African Americans continued. What began as a hashtag soon grew to a broader movement—first, in the United States and then internationally. In 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement—now distinct from the hashtag—initiated an urgent, national call to action and dialogue on the issue of police killings of unarmed African American youth. BLM broke into the mainstream, gaining millions of supporters and followers internationally after the 2014 killing of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson sparked reported civil unrest in Ferguson, Missouri [2].Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Black Lives Matter is not a centralized organization, but describes itself as a collective and a global network [3]. Officially, the movement is registered as the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation Inc. Some confusion occurred in 2020 when the  BLM movement was conflated with the Black Lives Matter Foundation, an entirely separate and unconnected charity in the US .  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Black Lives Matter primarily utilizes  social media  and  protests , as well as lobbying,  petitioning , and awareness raising around police brutality, systemic racism, and racial disparities.  Major Projects and Events  Black Lives Matter is the driving force behind the social movement  Black Lives Matter , and has played a leading role in the  George Floyd protests .

They work to highlight innovative ""practices in local governance and open new possibilities of effective co-operation in decision-making,"" primarily in the Czech Republic and the Balkan and post-Soviet countries. [1]  The association's projects are implemented through a range of activities, including public debates and meetings. Their citizen participation projects rely on a spectrum of methods, such as facilitated working groups, sociological  surveys , and polls. As part of the project implementation, Agora CE transfers ""knowledge and experience to their partners (towns or NGOs), enabling them to carry on without Agora CE's direct involvement."" The Association organises professional seminars, training, and conferences for their partners, in addition to providing consultations to interested parties. [1]  Origins and Development  Agora Central Europe (Agora CE) is a civic association, which was ""founded in 1998 with the aim of helping to enhance communication between local governments, central government bodies and citizens."" As part of this effort, the Association ""pursues consulting, advisory, educational, moderating and other activities,"" publishing materials about its work and organizing public meetings,  workshops , and social and cultural events, particularly with youth. [1]  Agora CE ""has been active in the Czech Republic for over ten years,"" aiming to promote democratization, in part by improving the dialogue between the central government, local government, and the public at large. [1] Many local authorities struggle with a lack of interest in public affairs from local residents. A similar issue often plagues public offices. For instance,  ""the local planning department would like to know what people think about the latest changes to the zoning plan, but only those residents whose land is to be taken up by the new road show up; or the local council decides to invest a large sum of money into renewal of a housing estate or into revamping the town square, but the people look on with disinterest or protest against the development – the local authority is about to make an investment and is not sure whether people actually want it or whether they will rebel against it."" [1]  Situations such as these are where Agora comes in, having dealt with those and many other situations in the past, helping to resolve them. They ""draw on the experience of the Netherlands which shows that the space for our engagement will be opening up even more – as the number of active citizens who are interested in being a part of the transformation of their town or village increases."" [1]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Agora CE is a non-profit, non-governmental organization founded under Czech law as public benefit company, with founding documents available on their web page.  Director and co-founder, Ivana Bursikova, named by the Managing Board, is in charge of the organization. Agora CE has no members beyond the Managing Board and Supervisory Board, which guarantees the transparency and legality of the organization's operations, its funding and non-profit nature.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Agora CE creates, coordinates, and implements specific projects of citizen participation in decision-making in towns and regions according to their Methodology of Seven Steps. [2]  They ""hold, organise and steer public debates, meetings, and discussions on specific issues of municipal development."" [1] The Association also organizes public inquiries and  surveys , via telephone interviews or opinion polls, before processing their outcomes.  Furthermore, they support the municipalities in their  participatory budgeting  according to their Methodology. [3]Agora CE also runs a student debate competition known as ""Students' Agora"" using their methodology  [4]  annually from 2005. For more information, please see the  website, in Czech .  In addition to the local level, Agora CE facilitates working group meetings and  workshops  at the national level, along with seminars on citizen participation in decision-making. Relatedly, Agora CE holds ""expert training courses on the use of new methods of communication with citizens in the segment of public administration.""

The GIGA is committed to a global approach to scholarship, which works with perspectives, concepts, and experiences from different world regions. The institute is dedicated to providing policy advice based on high-quality research. With this mandate — its research and knowledge transfer — the GIGA aims to achieve both academic and societal impact. [1]  As a member of the Leibniz Association, it follows the Leibniz dictum of  “ theoria cum praxi .”  Through their research, GIGA scholars identify trends early and provide strategic analyses, giving political and social debates important impetus. The GIGA advises decision makers in politics, business, and the media. As part of the Accountability and Participation Research Programme, the GIGA engages in the debate of the challenges for the participation of young people in across the globe. [2]  Origins and Development  The GIGA builds on a rich history of over 50 years of research on Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Middle East related issues. A centre of scientific excellence, the GIGA emerged in 2006 after the restructuring of the German Overseas Institute, which was founded in 1964. With its long-standing record as a source of world-class social science research, and its hosting of the largest non-university information centre for Area Studies and Comparative Area Studies in Germany, it is a trusted organisation among institutions and partners in Hamburg, in Germany, and within the international scientific community. [3]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The GIGA carries out  research  on four world regions: Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. Under the umbrella of the GIGA, scholars conduct research in four regional institutes on the relevant developments on the ground and participate in at least one of four research areas:Accountability and Participation  Peace and Security  Growth and Development  Power and Ideas [4]The GIGA is jointly funded by the German Federal Foreign Office, the Hamburg Ministry of Science, Research and Equalities, and the other federal states. [5]  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The world is in a state of transition. Economies and societies around the globe are becoming increasingly interdependent; rising powers such as China and India are exerting growing influence; and while new opportunities are arising, new forms of terrorism, violence, and conflict are also emerging. Building on its reputation as one of the leading research institutes for Area Studies and Comparative Area Studies, the GIGA is committed to using academic rigor to help make sense of the increasingly complex world situation. [6]  GIGA researchers are sought-after experts among decision makers in politics, business, and civil society, as well as among media representatives and other stakeholders. Research-based policy advice and knowledge transfer to the wider public are essential elements of their mandate. Thus, not only are GIGA research findings published in top peer-reviewed academic journals and prestigious university publishing houses, but outreach activities also include three well-established publication series and impactful public and exclusive events. [7]  Major Projects and Events  The project “  Democracy and Games: Analog and Digital Game-based Learning Tools for Youth Work  ” (DEMOGAMES) aims to contribute to this task through the provision of game-based learning tools for  democratic education  in youth work. The DEMOGAMES project is part of the Strategic Partnership for KA2 — Cooperation for Innovation and the Exchange of Good Practices supported by the Erasmus+ Youth in Action program 2019 of the  European Commission . [8]  GIGA Lead Researcher Prof. Dr. Sabine Kurtenbach conducted a series of research projects on Youth participation in violent contexts between 2014 and 2017 named “ Against all Odds - Youth in Post-War Societies ”.

RSF offers investing, lending, and giving services to individuals and enterprises committed to improving society and the environment. The example of RSF provides valuable lessons of how to facilitate meaningful and direct relationships across sectors and among diverse stakeholders within a structure of disciplined investment practice. It is unique in that it holds quarterly pricing meetings for its borrowers and investors to discuss and influence interest and spread rates, rather than use the commonly-accepted LIBOR rates. Together the group gains insight into each other’s financial needs, priorities, and plans.  RSF has a clearly defined set of values that emphasize trust and listening to understand investor and investee needs. Participation is carried out mostly through two mechanisms: community pricing meetings and shared gifting circles, which are both characterized by joint deliberation and decision-making. There is a sense that all affected voices are heard and that there is space for informed decision-making.  Origins and Development  RSF Social Finance has its beginnings in 1936 as the Rudolf Steiner Foundation, Inc., established “primarily for the furtherance of the interests of the cause and teachings” of Rudolf Steiner. From 1936 to 1983, RSF engaged in fundraising and charitable giving to organisations and initiatives arising directly out of Steiner’s work and lectures. In 1983, Siegfried Finser (a trustee of the Foundation) began discussing with colleague John Alexandra ways to work with money that were more consistent with the philosophy of Rudolf Steiner. These conversations led to the emergence of RSF’s lending program in 1984. That year, the foundation received a request for a loan to rebuild the Pine Hill Waldorf School in New Hampshire, which was destroyed by a fire the previous year. When the request was made, RSF only had USD 6,000cash in assets. However, they reached out to the community – who had incentive to see the school rebuilt – to fundraise and were able to make their first loan commitment of USD 500,000. This experience demonstrated the importance of community trust to RSF and its role in lending activities.  Following their success with the Waldorf school, RSF’s donor advised fund (DAF) activities started in 1985 and have been growing since to meet the needs of investors and borrowers. In 2005, RSF was among the first to launch mission-aligned DAFs, allowing assets held in DAFs to be invested for social and environmental benefit. RSF has also moved to work with for-profit institutions. In 2008, RSF launched the Mezzanine Fund, which was the first fund to provide mission-aligned financing (from accredited investors) for early-stage social enterprises. The following year, RSF stopped using LIBOR to set interest rates and launched RSF Prime, a community-based model for determining interest rates based on Quarterly Pricing Meetings (QPM) between investors, borrowers, and RSF. Finally, in 2010, after evidencing the lack of transparency in the dysfunctional financial sector, RSF divested from all public equities and redirected capital to investments more closely aligned with its values.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  RSF currently has seven 100%-owned affiliates: three non-profit and four for-profit. This mixture of entities allows RSF to differentiate between different uses of capital and match the motivations of donors and investors with the use of funds for investees and grantees. Two of the seven entities make up RSF’s social enterprise lending program: RSF Social Investment Fund, Inc. (SIF) and RSF Social Enterprise, Inc (SEI). SIF originates and manages non-profit social enterprise loans and SEI originates and manages for-profit social enterprise loans.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  RSF achieves impact in part by funding social enterprises that face challenges in raising capital from conventional funders. These include social enterprises that choose to remain rooted in a particular community and offer an inspiration for others rather than pursuing scale in their own operations, or those which need a much longer time to build a sustainable supply chain, or which face various forms of unconscious bias, related to gender or race, for example. These are highly innovative enterprises that challenge the status quo but are often dismissed as “unbankable”. RSF’s lending structure is centered on building community and generating a viable alternative to the complexity and opacity in the current banking system by providing direct, long-term loans based on personal relationships. RSF’s loan instrument may be the only one in the world that allows investors and borrowers to influence interest rates based on input from quarterly face-to-face pricing meetings (QPMs).  Major Projects and Events  RSF’s first QPM was held in September 2009. QPMs give borrowers and investors an opportunity to discuss and influence interest rates and spread rates by sharing their motivations, needs, and priorities. Beyond bringing borrowers and investors together, QPMs give borrowers the opportunity to consider the value of their loan in a different way. It is not just a question of getting the best rate, but also about identifying the best long-term partner that can help take them where they want to go, as well as the value of the community that RSF attracts. According to those involved in QPMs:  RSF’s purpose to transform the way the world works with money is exemplified in the engaged process we call pricing meetings. We cannot imagine a more direct, transparent, and personal way to work with interest rates. Though the system may not be perfect for everyone. – John Bloom, Senior Director of Organizational Culture [1].  When we had the last pricing meeting, I was taken by how much we were aligned. Rationally I know we’re aligned. But when you sit in a room and really hear everyone’s story, it takes everyone out of a box and brings everyone in the full human view of who they are. But we have a range we can work with. And when I’m really connected to someone or something, then I want to give more to it. I want to give more to this kind of process because it’s something I believe in. – Chris Mann, Guayaki Sustainable Forest Products [2].  In the case of shared gifting, RSF gives distribution and allocation authority to the recipients of gift money. By shifting the control of grant funds from donors to organisations, trust, accountability, reciprocity and relationships are created in a way that moves beyond traditional philanthropic models. There are no directed outcomes or objectives for how the recipients use the money; instead, the group uses its collaborative knowledge to determine the best use of the funds. Ultimately, the community decides how community wealth is distributed. RSF’s model also allows recipients to create mutually beneficial collaborations which are rare in standard competitive models. Grantees have responded optimistically:  When you take an egalitarian approach to the sharing of resources, seemingly insurmountable problems become doable. – Curtis Flemming of the Fresh Life Foundation [3].  It builds a culture of cooperation and spreading wealth rather than competition and a lack of transparency in philanthropy. – Haleh Zandi, Executive Director of Planting Justice [4].Analysis and Lessons Learned  Through formally embedding stakeholder alignment within deal structures, and combining different forms of investor capital, RSF’s lending program is magnifying the impacts of its borrowers by helping them collaborate with mission-aligned financial stakeholders. Since 1984, RSF has given out more than $285 million in loans and more than $100 million in grants. RSF’s loans through the SIF and SEI have maintained a 100% repayment rate of principal plus interest, which has allowed RSF to fund their operating costs on the difference between the interest rate the investee pays and the interest rate the investor receives. This also means that there is a low but consistent return for investors.  Publications  See Also  References  [1] Clark, C. and Soriano, J.

Thousand Currents emphasizes long-term funding relationships with effective grassroots organisations and social movements led by or serving women, youth, and indigenous peoples that work on the interdependent issues of food sovereignty, alternative economies and climate justice. The Buen Vivir Fund is based on the concept of buen vivir, or ‘right living’, which originates from indigenous peoples in Latin America. The term denotes a way of living that is in balance with the natural world, community, and generations past, present, and future.  Origins and Development  In 2015, Thousand Currents approached the former Buen Vivir Fund Director Joanna Levitt Cea about establishing an in-house impact investment fund. At the time of the initialconversations, a 2014 G8 report projected impact investments to surpass government overseas aid, estimating that more than US$400bn would be invested by 2020. Levitt Cea brought her experience of championing policies to ensure citizen participation and human rights safeguards at global financial institutions to Thousand Currents’ unique approach to grass-roots grantmaking.  Between October 2015 and January 2016, Levitt Cea conducted a landscape review of impact investing and baseline research, which included interviews with more than 40 actors in diverse realms of the impact investment space as well as Thousand Currents staff, board, and grantees. Thousand Currents determined that there were two major gaps in the field of impact investment in which their organisation was uniquely positioned to add value: the systemic lack of participation of the ‘beneficiaries’ of impact investment; and that, despite the rapidly growing diversity of entities seeking and receiving impact investment, the terms of this investment tend to remain strikingly unvaried. Thus, Thousand Currents decided to create an investment vehicle that would centre on the full participation of grass-roots organisations receiving investment capital and in doing so innovate investment terms and practices.  In May 2016, a draft proposal for the founding of the Buen Vivir Fund was circulated to select Thousand Currents donors, established grassroots partners, and advisers. In total, ten grassroots organisations were invited: nine established Thousand Currents partners and one new addition. These are: AFEDES: Women’s Association for the Development of Sacatepéquez (Guatemala); ISMUGUA: Institute for Overcoming Urban Poverty (Guatemala); GRAVIS: Center of People’s Science for Rural Development (India); CIELO: Federación Indígena Empresarial y Comunidades Locales de México (Mexico); DESMI: Social and Economic Development for Indigenous Mexicans (Mexico); EduPaz (Mexico); Ñepi Behña (Mexico); Women’s Awareness Center Nepal (Nepal); Ubunye Foundation (South Africa); and Whole World Women Association (South Africa).  In October 2016, 20 representatives from the ten participating grass-roots organisations joined eight investors, five advisers, and six Thousand Currents staff in Mexico City for the Buen Vivir Fund’s inaugural learning event. This event was structured as a five-day workshop to collaboratively spark the design of the Fund’s terms of investment, financial practices, and governance structure. After the Mexico City learning event, members of the Founding Circle opted into six sub-groups to develop the Buen Vivir Fund’s Guiding Framework. The Guiding Framework describes the Buen Vivir Fund’s strategic and operational goals and highlights those which deviate from conventional investment practices in five key areas: governance, risk, interest rates, returns, and impact.  In July 2017, the Guiding Framework was submitted for approval by the Founding Circle, from this point referred to as the Members Assembly, and enthusiastically approved by all members.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The Buen Vivir Fund’s Members Assembly is the governing authority of the Fund, making decisions on Fund investments and direction. The Members’ Assembly is made up of one representative from each grass-roots and investor organisation. This governing body is supported by the Buen Vivir Fund Management Team, staffed by Thousand Currents, which implements the decisions of the Members Assembly and operates the Fund.  The due diligence process of the Buen Vivir Fund includes peer evaluation by Fund members. When a project is approved by the Members Assembly for investment by the Fund, this investment can include grant support, investment capital (to date, all investments have been in the form of debt), and ‘beyond-financial investment’, such as specific advising support that the project may be seeking. In the lending model of the Buen Vivir Fund, projects borrow and return 100 per cent of the principal received. Additionally, a solidarity contribution, referred to as an  aporte  payment, is made, over and above return of principal. Different from fixed interest payments, the amounts of these  aporte  payments are self-determined by organisations and made during or upon completion of successful projects.  The Buen Vivir Fund’s day-to-day operations are overseen by the Fund Management Team, which supports the Members’ Assembly and is comprised of two Thousand Currents staff, and two Buen Vivir Finance Fellows who provide support on operations and are supervised by the Fund’s Director. This team is responsible for managing the implementation of decisions made around the Fund such as deploying the capital for a loan awarded with terms specified by a Members Assembly vote. In addition, when the Members Assembly is preparing to make a decision, the Fund Management Team is responsible for bringing information, recommendations, and questions to the Members Assembly. This includes compiling information on Fund activity, progress, and learnings through biannual updates and annual reports.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The Buen Vivir Fund draws from governance approaches used primarily by indigenous organisations in Latin America. Founding members from Mexico and Guatemala contributed significantly to envisioning and shaping the Fund’s governance model. The Members Assembly is comprised of one representative from each of the ten grassroots organisations, eight financial investor organisations, and one Thousand Currents representative. It follows a protocol for decision-making and collective reflection and requires a majority vote for all investment-related decisions within the Fund. Each member has equal voting rights in this decision-making process, which steers all decisions related to investment, strategy, membership, and conflict resolution. Examples of decisions made by the Members’ Assembly include the approval of new members (financial or grass-roots organisations) and the approval of terms under which capital is lent. Efforts are made for the Members’ Assembly to reach consensus, but membership is structured so the majority’s aggregate position is held by borrowing organisations. This is a structural manifestation of the commitment to participation. Issues are brought to the attention of the Members’ Assembly during two virtual meetings held per year and an in-person Learning Exchange held annually. In total, it is estimated that representatives commit ten hours per year to the Members’ Assembly, not including attending the annual four-day Learning Exchange in person.  The Buen Vivir Fund loan agreements are unique in that, while complying with regulations of the various countries in which the Fund operates, the agreements are not designed to be enforced in courts but specify that any disputes are to be resolved by the Members’ Assembly. For instance, if a borrower is unable to make an agreed-upon principal repayment, resolution takes place within the Members’ Assembly. First, the borrower is asked to describe in writing the reasons for an inability to repay. If the Members’ Assembly determines the borrower is acting in good faith according to the Fund’s guiding principles but, for example, due to conditions outside the borrower’s control repayment is not possible, two options are available. Either the borrower can create an updated, viable plan to complete principal repayment, which will be amended to the loan agreement; or the Members’ Assembly will forgo the loan in its entirety. If the Members’ Assembly decides the borrower is acting in bad faith to the Fund’s guiding principles, the Members’ Assembly collectively determines what penalty will be applied. To date, no conflicts that require such remedial action have arisen.  Major Projects and Events  At the end of 2018, the Buen Vivir Fund had made four loans with two in the immediate pipeline worth a total of US$465,000 to grass-roots partners in Latin America, Southern Africa, and South Asia. With US$1m committed, the Buen Vivir Fund expected to release the second tranche of capital in mid-2019. Examples of projects which are benefiting from these loans are varied and encompass a wide range of approaches that include:Strengthening and expanding markets for fair-trade cooperative suppliers in Mexico;  Building a medical clinic and training center to promote and preserve Mayan traditional medicine practices in Guatemala; and  Building affordable housing for migrant women and children in South Africa.In addition to loan disbursal, this pilot of a completely new practice of impact investment built collaboratively with grass-roots partners is an outcome in itself. The holistic and thorough nature of this endeavor cannot be overstated. From an application process which is peer reviewed, to an inclusive, democratic governing body, to a definition of returns that encompasses community wellbeing, the Buen Vivir Fund has brought transformative participation, in which people partake in decision-making, into impact investment.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The Buen Vivir Fund started small in terms of volume of capital, having raised US$1m in loan capital for its initial investment cycle of 2018–20. This US$1m, plus US$300,000 raised in grant capital, is being deployed with the guidance of the Fund’s Members Assembly. Over the first five years, the Buen Vivir Fund is poised to expand its membership to between 30 and 50 and increase its investments to US$5m. By the end of 2018, the Buen Vivir Fund was fully operational and had completed its first round of loan disbursal, linking US$427,700 in loan capital to US$113,000 of grant capital across nine projects led by grass-roots community organizations in Latin America, North America, Southern Africa, and South Asia.

EduPaz promotes agro-ecological practices that advance food sovereignty and improve community health.  Origins and Development  EduPaz has been a grass-roots partner of  Thousand Currents , receiving numerous grants, for over ten years and was invited to join the  Buen Vivir Fund  Founding Circle in mid-2016.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  In September 2018, EduPaz received US$90,000 in loan capital and US$15,000 in grant capital from the Buen Vivir Fund, the largest amount disbursed in the first round of lending. The loan terms decided upon by EduPaz and the Buen Vivir Fund include a three-year repayment plan, and the organisation anticipates contributing an aporte of 15 per cent. As a member of the Fund’s Founding Circle, EduPaz retains one seat on the Members Assembly governing body and has participated in all Members Assembly votes since the Fund’s founding, including the peer-review of another grass-roots organisation’s application.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Don Javier Inda, one of the founders of EduPaz, describes the values that underpin the work the organisation does:  Our main role is to accompany and advise in the journey of the groups with whom we work. It is [a] process of popular education: a shared and reflective practice among the participants; learning together in the process itself and walking together; supported by the collective wisdom of indigenous and peasant cultures; and a bet on their creativity and resilience. These are concepts and values we see as fundamental. The dominant economy is based on profit and seeks to commericalize everything. It creates greater inequality and poverty. Power and wealth are concentrated in smaller and smaller groups. Natural goods are exploited without measure, contaminating the earth, air and water, exhausting resources that belong to everyone, serving few and threatening the future of humanity and survival on the planet. In this context, we recognize the following as fundamental in our work:  Moving towards an economy centered on human needs and in harmony with nature is a vital and strategic option. Heal relationships between human groups, between men and women, between peoples and nature.  Development is not only economic, not just about producing and selling. Development must satisfy all basic human needs and meet ethical standards and values.  Value contributions of the grassroots groups: work, organization, knowledge, experience, decisions located in the specific context of each place and time, proximity that favors healing the earth and improving the environment.  The poor are agents with dignity and not objects of beneficence. With their work they are creators of wealth and have the right to all that is required for a good living: food, fair work, health, education, housing, rest, free and informed political participation.  Thousand Currents and the Buen Vivir Fund create a bridge between donors and grassroots groups with joint decisions, shared risks, non-extractive loans to grassroots groups, in a new experience that opens the way to an alternative economy.  Major Projects and Events  EduPaz is using the grant capital to incubate a community fund, A Helping Hand for the Ecology of Chiapas (Una Mano Amiga, UMA). The UMA fund will in turn use loan capital to seed the work of rural producers to create small enterprises. To date, 180,000 pesos have been disbursed to 241 community members involved with 82 projects to seed a wide range of small enterprises such as coffee and chicken cooperative businesses; mechanics and carpenters; and bakeries and grocery stores.

Rather than training workers for employment that doesn’t exist, it focuses on building a local economy by catalyzing new cooperative businesses. Examples include Evergreen Energy Solutions, Green City Growers and the Evergreen Cooperative Laundry.  The initiative thus starts by creating jobs, and then recruiting and training local residents to fill them. The model has been successful in creating new cooperatives, redirecting local profits to local communities, preventing outsourcing, giving ownership to employees, and further consolidating profits within the community .Origins and Development  The initiative was founded in 2008 by a group of local institutions including a local hospital, university and local government. It was developed as an alternative to trickle-down economics in the Cleveland area, by focusing on creating local jobs and worker-owned businesses rather than employee training [1].  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The initiative consists of a specific organizational model made up of worker-owned cooperative businesses, including a laundry, green energy business and vegetable growers. All employees of these businesses are also part owners.  It is partly funded by a partnership between the local government, philanthropic community and university partners, known as the  Greater University Circle .  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The Evergreen Cooperatives Initiative pioneered an approach now known as the Cleveland Model, which is a form of  cooperative management  that aims to implement cooperative principles at a larger scale than many traditional cooperatives [2].  Its associated businesses are all designed to be sustainable in both the economic and environmental sense, with the aim being to keep the profits, jobs and benefits of the businesses in the communities that need them [3].  Major Projects and Events  The main businesses of the Evergreen Cooperatives Initiative are:Evergreen Energy Solutions : provides green and energy saving services such as solar panelsEvergreen Cooperative Laundry : a commercial laundry service using environmentally friendly technologyGreen City Growers : producing lettuce, greens and herbsAnalysis and Lessons Learned  The initiative's approach has attracted significant accolades and media attention since it was launched [4]. It is particularly noteworthy because the Cleveland Model has scalability and replicability built into its design [5], with the hope being that the model could be implemented in other low-income, post-industrial communities in the US.  Whilst other initiatives have been launched around the country, it is worth noting that in Cleveland, a specific set of circumstances may have contributed to Evergreen's success there. In particular, the enthusiasm for alternatives to capitalism following the 2008 financial crisis, along with supportive allies and access to funds, enabled the initiative to start strong [6]. Nonetheless, Evergreen stands as a leader and inspiration for the cooperative economy in the United States.  Publications  See Also  References  [1] Evergeen Cooperatives Initiative (2020). About Us.

It is a non-profit organization aimed at redirecting the flow of capital to local food systems.Slow Money catalyses the formation of self-organizing local groups, which use a diversity of approaches to funding: public meetings, on-farm events, pitch fests, peer-to-peer loans, investment clubs and, most recently, non-profit clubs making 0% loans. So far, seventeen local networks and 11 investment clubs have formed to support local enterprises focused on locally grown produce.  Origins and Development  Since beginning in 2010, Slow Money has facilitated the movement of $73 million into 752 food enterprises [1].  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Slow Money catalyses the formation of self-organizing local groups. There are currently 27 groups in the US.Specializations, Methods and Tools  Local groups use a range of different approaches including public meetings, on-farm events, pitch fests, peer-to-peer loans, investment clubs and, most recently, nonprofit clubs making 0% loans [2].  Major Projects and Events  Slow Money clubs operate in diverse ways. One Colorado club,  2Forks , offers 0% loans to local farmers and food producers. Members make a small investment into a general pool of money, and then local producers propose their pitch at a club meeting, where members decide collaboratively and collectively how to allocate money based on how much impact the proposal will have on the local food economy. Repaid loans goes back into the general pool for redistribution. In many cases, recipients of loans also become investors in the club.2Forks also emphasizes the non-financial returns such as supporting young and local food entrepreneurs and enhancing the local food economy [3].

Specializations, Methods and Tools  Cooperatives and charities are invited to buy shares of Ético, giving farmers an opportunity to own a portion of the supply chain. Profits from the business operations are reinvested in smallholder farmers through the charities and cooperatives. These investments assist farmers in improving quality of produce, infrastructure, and social and ecological sustainability. Some examples include construction of cupping laboratories for coffee growers, loans to enable land ownership, facilitation of honey production to avoid deforestation and reduce pesticide use, and cattle purchases to diversify livelihood strategies.  Major Projects and Events  Alongside its trading activities, Ético also collaborates with its cooperatives other partners on social, environmental and ethical initiatives to further empower the communities it works with. One such initiative is the Recognition of the Unpaid Work of Women in agricultural production and supply chains. As part of this initiative, Ético calculated the cost of all the unpaid labor carried out by women and included this cost in the amount of money paid to its agricultural cooperatives.

Following this, interest amongst the community grew and a credit union was established. As time went on, members became interested in the benefits of a cooperative beyond economic returns and pursued training and funding to become an established cooperative [1].  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Funds are mobilized through members’ savings, and support KKR’s economic projects such as group insurance schemes, income generating activities, and community credit unions that provide financial services to members. KKR therefore links savers and borrowers in the same community. Members participate in the governance of the credit unions through the Area Committee and its sub committees, which meet on a monthly basis. At the annual General Meeting members have a chance to elect members of sub-committees and voice any concerns with the wider cooperative community.

Through public protests, the farmers gained rights to supply the Bombay Milk Scheme and formally registered as the Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers’ Union. Further successes include leasing of part of a government creamery, which secured market access, the lobbying of the government to limit butter imports so that the Union could supply the local market, and the development of other milk products under the “Amul” brand.In 1973, the Union joined with other cooperatives to form the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Limited (GCMMF), which inherited the Amul brand. Since 1940, dairy farmers have successfully negotiated so that they now receive over 70% of market price of dairy products.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The Federation has received funding from multiple sources over the years, including Oxfam and the New Zealand government [1].  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The initial development of the unions and cooperative utilized  protests  and  strike action  and lobbying to apply pressure to apply pressure on the government for action, as well as the formation of  cooperatives  [2].

SCCWC child care centers are owned jointly by the care providers and the mothers of the children.  The SCCWCs are unique in the fact that they offer an integrated care approach so that children receive basic education and social skills, adequate nutrition, and health services.  Origins and DevelopmentKnow the events surrounding this organization’s development? Help uscomplete this section!Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The Self Employed Women's Association (SEWA) is a trade union in India representing women working primarily in the informal economy. It operates over 100 cooperatives in different sectors, including agriculture, savings and loans, and labor, of which the childcare cooperative is one [1].  The board of SCCWC is comprised of cooperative members and is elected every 3-5 years. The board manages activities and any issues that arise during the parent-teacher meetings or care provider meetings; ensures that financial regulations are observed; and sets nominal fees which parents pay each month, but operation costs are subsidized by SEWA, donors and local government.  Specializations, Methods and ToolsCooperative ManagementMajor Projects and EventsKnow what projects or events this organization has led or supported? Help uscomplete this section!Analysis and Lessons Learned  Enrolling their children at one of the SEWA centers enables women to work and has a positive impact on their income. In addition, enrollment results in reduced stress for mother and potential improvements in nutrition, education and overall health for their children [2].  The following excerpt is taken from  a report by the International Labor Organization  on childcare in the informal economy:  Sangini Child Care Workers’ Cooperative plays a larger role in the community in addition to providing child care. Child care workers are selected from the community and receive training before taking up their responsibilities. Training and skills upgrading take place every three months, and there is an in-house capacity building team that focuses on enhancing the skills of the  balsevikas . As a result, the child care workers are seen as leaders within their communities given their knowledge on children’s health, nutrition, social development and early education. The centers also serve as a public service access point for vaccinations, primary health care, and nutritional advice for parents. When women workers in the informal economy see that their children are well cared for this builds up trust and solidarity among SEWA members and commitment to the trade union and the associated cooperative model. Cooperative members also mobilize the community to demand improvements to the public ICDS and offers training to ICDS child care workers. The cooperative is a pivotal part of the social fabric of these dense urban communities and opens avenues for engaging with the local and national governments [2].

The association:initiates and promotes offers of  civic education  for different target groups;  promotes the scientific monitoring of civic education programmes;  fosters national and international exchange with actors and providers of civic education. [1]Origins and Development  Demokrative was founded on 02 June 2016 in Zurich (CH) and is an association according to Art. 60 ff. of the Swiss Civil Code (Schweizerisches Zivilgesetzbuch ZGB).Since 2017, Demokrative has been a member of the network of out-of-school actors in the realm of Education for Sustainable Development.[2] In 2018, Demokrative became a member of the Democracy and Human Rights Education in Europe (DARE) Network (DARE is a Europe-wide network that aims to promote education for democratic citizenship and human rights[3]). Since 2020, the association has been based in Bern (CH).  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The association Demokrative - Initiative for civic education finances its activities and projects through membership fees and project-specific support from foundations, as well as, potentially, through donations. In order to save administrative and fixed costs, the Demokrative does not maintain an office.  Demokrative functions according to the principles required in Switzerland for non-profit associations. The statute of the association can be downloaded  here  (in German).A list of members and information about the current managing board and the auditor can be found online.[4]  Specializations, Methods and Tools  For Demokrative, democracy is seen as as topic, programme, and goal. The Association Demokrative promotes  civic education  and  democratic  citizenship.Civic education enables people to recognize and represent their interests, to participate in political processes and, in doing so, to meet their fellow human beings and their concerns with respect.  Demokrative promotes civic education by initiating and promoting educational offers for different target groups, by providing scientific support for civic education, and by networking and exchanging with actors from practice and science.[1]  Major Projects and Events  Core projects are the 'building blocks of democracy', which are instructor-led learning modules in which young people deal interactively with fundamental values and conflicting goals in democracy), projects in the area of game-based learning and the annually held Demokrative  round table . The Demokrative Round Table 2019 was held on the topic 'Chances and challenges of digitization for democracies'. About 25  workshops  of the building blocks of democracy program are held during one year with school classes. In the area of  game-based  learning, the project 'Let's play Democracy Barometer' resulted in free online print &amp; play material.[5] Also in the area of game based learning, the international cooperation project DEMOGAMES was started in 2019.[6]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  In its educational work, Demokrative emphasize interactive learning environments in which democratic processes can be experienced and democratic manners and participation can be practiced. In this understanding, the field of civic education overlaps with areas such as human rights education, the promotion of participation and the like.  It is important to Demokrative that educational formats are evaluated regularly, that these evaluations comply with social science standards and that the results of the evaluations are incorporated into the further development of the offerings.  Demokrative participates in exchanges between actors from the out-of-school and actors from the school sectors and in exchanges between actors and supporting organizations in areas whose topics and methods overlap with those of civic education. These include human rights education, the promotion of participation, tolerance training, projects that address democracy as a way of life and approaches from the field of peace-building.

Decided on by the President of the Republic, the Convention brings together 150 people, all drawn by lot; it represents the diversity of French society.At transnational level: The Franco-German dialogue on  strengthening of cross-border cooperation in the context of COVID-19 is an initiative of Missions Publiques which aims to bring together 40 citizens from each side of the Franco-German border in online working sessions in order to formulate recommendations to the public authorities to strengthen Franco-German cooperation on the cross-border territory and to make the cooperation arrangements more resilient to crises.Publicationshttps://urbanlab.parisandco.paris/a-la-une/actualites/belle-histoire-n-17-dialogue-citoyen-comment-impliquer-les-habitants-dans-la-fabrique-de-la-ville  https://www.lagazettedescommunes.com/663799/maitriser-la-reunion-publique-cest-tout-un-art/  https://www.mediacites.fr/enquete/nantes/2019/01/24/a-nantes-limites-et-loupes-de-la-democratie-participative/See AlsoGreat Debate on the Energy Transition in Nantes, FranceBlog articles  https://missionspubliques.org/le-blog/  Social mediaTwitter: https://twitter.com/MPubliques_ENLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/1987815/admin/  Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/missionspubliques",1,1,1,1,0,

Prior to this, tea laborers were poorly paid and the Kenyan tea market was dominated by multinational corporations with Kenyan producers having little control or participation.  Kenyan tea now commands a price premium compared to international competitors; it constitutes a major part of foreign exchange earnings; and 70% of the export value of tea is distributed to smallholders at the community level [1].  Origins and Development  Over the past 60 years, Kenya’s tea industry has transformed from large estates to smallholder farms. Smallholders pooled their resources through strong federated bodies to build economies of scale and succeed in competitive markets. They organised to analyse the value-chain; identified areas of perceived weakness; and addressed and rebranded their product in response. They were aided by a combination of new technology platforms, such as mobile money, and a supportive political environment—a nationalist government that halted the expansion of larger multinational players, creating space for the KDTA.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  KDTA is exclusively owned by 600,000 smallholder tea farmers from Kenya's tea growing counties [2].

The aim of the trust is to combat the negative impacts of mining on affected communities.  Origins and Development  In 2008, the Zimbabwean government and private companies began mining in the Marange diamond fields, displacing communities throughout the region. In 2015, several of these companies were united to form the Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Company (ZCDC). With the help of the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Association (ZELA), two communities founded their own organisations to combat the negative impacts of mining, including the Marange Development Trust (MDT).

Major Projects and Events  The Trust began by monitoring the mining companies’ operations and gathered information on violations. In August 2017, the MDT filed a lawsuit against the ZCDC, on the grounds that it had not conducted an environmental impact assessment (EIA). The lawsuit was ultimately successful, with the ZCDC forced to halt operations pending approval of an EIA certificate, and to enter a memorandum of understanding with the affected community.

It is no coincidence that the seat of the current School of Architecture, in use until the 1980s, was precisely that of the Academy itself in via Ricasoli, near Piazza San Marco.The university profile is outlined at the beginning of the last century when in 1907, in Florence, at the same location, a Special Architecture Course was established for the achievement of the diploma of professor of architectural design. In 1927-28 the Higher School of Architecture was established, promoted by local authorities to meet the cultural needs of Florence, a fully qualified seat for studies at a level more aimed at the profession of architect.Finally, in 1930, the course of study passed under the nascent Higher Institute of Architecture, with an autonomous organization and an organic study plan for the scientific-technical and historical-critical preparation of the student architects. Promoter of the initiative was Raffaello Brizzi, then president of the Tuscany Section of the Federation of Italian Architects and professor of architecture at the Academy.The Higher Institute of Architecture of Florence was governed by the Council composed of prof. Raffaello Brizzi, Director and Full Professor of &quot;Architectural Composition&quot;, by prof. Raffaello Fagnoni of &quot;Characters of buildings&quot; and by prof. Felice Jodi of “Construction Science”.Subsequently, with RD of 25 March 1936, the Higher Institute of Architecture was aggregated to the University of Architecture as a Faculty of Architecture of Florence, for the conduct of five-year courses and the achievement of the degree of doctor in architecture.Among the illustrious personalities who in the years that have made the history of the School of Architecture are remembered in various ways: Raffaello Brizzi (founder and dean from 1936-1944), Giovanni Michelucci (member of the Tuscan Group and dean of the Faculty in the period between 1944 and 1948), Piero Sanpaolesi (pivotal figure for the discipline of Architectural Restoration and headmaster from 1969 to 1971), Umberto Eco (internationally renowned intellectual and teacher in 1968). Numerous architects were trained at the School including: Andrea Branzi, Massimo Carmassi, David Fisher, Claudio Nardi, Adolfo Natalini, Renzo Piano (for a short period), David Palterer, Andrea Ponsi, Matteo Thun, Werner Tscholl.L.

Its aim is to build an alternative economic model.  To this end, it has set up a number of different economic activities  including an alternative social currency and community project [1].  Origins and Development  CIC was founded in 2010 by a group of activists. It has maintained an activist and revolutionary character, evidenced by its aims of economic transformation over reform or incremental changes. Its membership was increased through the  October 15 protests and occupations in Spain  against economic inequality [2].  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  CIC operates through a series of committees with different areas of responsibility. Committees meet on a regular basis in assemblies to make collective decisions through consensus. This organizational structure is non-hierarchical.  Outside of the committees are additional members of the cooperative, including self-employed workers who can use the cooperative as a way of being self-employed without having to pay the large fee due to the state to register for tax purposes [3].  Specializations, Methods and Tools  CIC integrates economic alternatives, such as peer-to-peer exchange, social currency, protection of economic activity between the associate cooperatives, and reduction of individualized liability. Liability is reduced through the legal cooperative framework: individual debts of the members cannot be claimed from the cooperatives and the debts of the cooperative cannot be claimed from the members. Furthermore, the CIC has set up a series of entities, whose legal form allows its self-employed members to issue invoices, usually a process requiring a prohibitively expensive license.

Origins and Development  Established in December 2002 by the New Zealand Government in response to a recommendation of the Royal Commission on Genetic Modification, which found that NZ's policy making processes had missed the cultural, ethical and spiritual issues raised by modern biotechnologies such as genetic modification.Its Terms of Reference reflected global developments in science policy making including those contained in the report of the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology (2000), which said that the culture of policymaking needed to change ‘so that it becomes normal to bring science and the public into dialogue about new developments at an early stage.’Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  An independent body that was free to set its own work programme within a Terms of Reference. Its 10-12 members were appointed by the Government not on the basis of expertise in bioethics, ethics or science but rather to ensure diversity of training, experience and background. The Council always had a significant Māori presence.  The Council was supported by a full time secretariat of 3-4 people and had an annual budget of NZ$1.5M.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The Council was a pioneer in the development and use of public engagement processes based on public dialogue and deliberation in both face-to-face and online contexts.  Major Projects and Events  The Council organised 2 nationwide public dialogue processes: one on 'Human genes in other organisms' (2004) and the other on 'Xenotransplantation: animal-to-human transplantation' (2005). It organised 1 nationwide public deliberation on 'Who gets born? Pre-birth testing' (2007-8).  It also did work on nanotechnology, human embryo research, issues of Māori tikanga ('the Māori way of doing things correctly'), and how to engage the public on complex science issues.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The Council engaged with thousands of New Zealanders in new ways. Independent evaluation showed that high levels of satisfaction with its processes, which it learned to make more relevant to policy makers. It contributed to the evidence base about engaging the public effectively on complex issues and showed that lay citizens can deliberate well online even on highly contested issues.Despite domestic and international recognition, the New Zealand Government never formally respond to any of its recommendations and Toi te Taiao: the Bioethics Council was disestablished in March 2009.

Origins and Development  DARE was officially launched on 28 June 2003 in Antwerp. It is a network of European providers of Education for Democratic Citizenship and Human Rights Education.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  DARE is registered under Belgian NPO law as a non-profit organisation (vereniging zonder winstoogmerk) and has its legal seat in Belgium. Its members represent organisations of different size and working in different fields of education in the fields democratic citizenship and human rights.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  We are a community of practice representing different approaches to education. DARE is engaged in:Exchange of information, contents, methods and staff;  Common programmes for education and qualification of staff, board members and volunteers in member organisations;  Advocacy for education for democratic citizenship and human rights at the Council of Europe and European Union;  Common educational projects, exchange on standards and good practice.Major Projects and Events  The annual General Assembly is the core of the membership networking. Furthermore, DARE provides trainings and is taking part in European projects. By 2020, DARE is participating in the following projects:Project: Unsung HeroesCompetendo – The Open Source Toolbox for Civic EducationProject DEMOGAMESProject EntreComp 360: Promoting Initiative and Engagement across SectorsProject: DIGIT-AL – Digital Transformation in Adult Learning for Active CitizenshipProject: Focus Group Competencies for Democratic CultureProject TEVIP: Transforming European Values into PracticeAnalysis and Lessons Learned  Education for Democratic Citizenship and Human Rights Education are relevant for any social context, for any age group and in any region in Europe. Instead of dividing education and learning into sectors or age groups, we should seek cooperation between non-formal and formal education and also with civil society as the huge non-formal and informal learning and empowerment space for participation.  In times of transformation with a lot of complex social challenges and also threats for democracy inEurope, citizenship education and human rights education should be recognized in their systemic relevance and promoted as a learning field for the development of key competencies - knowledge, skills, attitudes and values.  Critical thinking, active participation, empowerment of indivduals and groups, learning about complex social, economic, ecologic and cultural topics, such as digital transformation, climate change, data-economy, global fairness, social inclusion, and others, require adequate new responses in education and cooperation.

The layout of the space meets several objectives:- remove dirt and danger;- use the space for urban agriculture and greening;- create beauty and link between neighbors, unite around a project and open it up to the city [i].The place bringing together permaculture mounds, rest areas and a street library has been appropriated by the neighborhood and activities are organized there to liven up the space. By meeting citizens around the space, exchanges are created within the district. The place thus occupies several functions: that of garden, of public place but also of concertation of the life of the district.Origins and developmentVacant lot: a public health problemThe Carré Casgrain land was originally a triplex that burned down a few years ago in Montreal, in the Rosemont-Petite-Patrie borough, and the private land has remained vacant since. Several citizen complaints concerning the cleanliness of the land have been filed with the City since the early 2000s.Creation of a green lane committee (2015-2016)In June 2015, a collective of citizens created a green lane committee between rue Bellechasse and rue Beaubien, adjoining the land. The green lane committees are citizen initiatives supported by the boroughs of the city of Montreal, so that residents of the neighborhood can appropriate the public space and more particularly, implement projects for greening the riparian strips of public roads. The borough of Rosemont-Petite-Patrie in which this project is taking place is the borough with the largest number of green alleys in Montreal in 2019 [ii].The procedures with the borough lead to an authorization granted at the beginning of 2016 and flower beds dug in the lane by the Rosemont-Petite-Patrie borough in October 2016. In parallel with these activities in the lane, the committee ruelle verte, now established, is regularly called upon by the residents of the district to invest the space of the vacant land, identified as a public health problem.First steps in the field (2016-2017)In the spring of 2016, a resident of the neighborhood approached the Green Lane Committee, motivated to invest the land and take care of it. A meeting is organized in the field, then workshops to create gardening tubs are conducted during the year. In the summer of 2017, a field cleaning operation is organized by the residents of the district, allowing the first season of square gardening. The green lane project therefore gained momentum when part of the committee decided to appropriate the vacant land adjacent to the lane. No official authorization has been requested from the landowner or the City for the occupation of the space. The development and greening of space positively modify the relationship of residents to vacant space [iii].Developments (2017-2020)The Casgrain square, a gardening spaceGardening is carried out in tubs, the first year, then on permaculture mounds in 2018 and finally in soil cultivation in 2019, following backfilling of the land. Landscaping was carried out in 2018, establishing cultivation spaces and facilities were installed on the ground: street library, table and benches, etc. In the philosophy of permaculture, ornamental plants and edible plants come together. Collective activities are organized and punctuate the year: from sowing, to planting and closing the garden. The place is seen as a space for urban agriculture within the district. The harvests and the space are accessible to everyone, gardener and passer-by. The group is organized in a flexible and horizontal way, with the participation of all depending on the wishes and availability. Since the space belongs to an owner, citizens of gardeners sometimes come up against issues linked to the occupation of the land.private property. Equipment is thus installed on the space by the owner or tenants, such as advertising panels or clothing recovery boxes. The latter hamper the practice of gardening and the collective mobilizes and calls on the public authorities to ensure their withdrawal. In 2019, in reaction to a land reserve status for end of park granted by the City, the owner of the land bulldozed the Casgrain square.b. The Casgrain square, a public square  [iv]The purpose of the Casgrain Square space is to foster social ties in the community. Exchanges are created between gardeners and passer-bys, but also between residents of the neighborhood. There are many examples of spontaneous occupation of space, from dinners to improvised parties or even work meetings. To promote the reappropriation of the public space by the residents of the district, activities are regularly organized at the square Casgrain.In 2017, musician jams are offered by an involved gardener, then many activities are organized in 2018. Improvised and spontaneous, the activities are mostly informal and involve a few participants in the project as well. only neighbors. Note in this regard the evening of Midsummer&#39;s Day which brings together residents and friends around a barbecue, but also an event of corn roast for example. In 2019, the cultural project is gaining momentum: many events are organized in the square. With the growing notoriety of the space, multiple event proposals are brought in by people outside the project. In 2019, the Casgrain square hosted concerts, a conference on zero waste, film screenings and a parade. These projects are often carried out in conjunction with community or cultural organizations.vs. Le Carré Casgrain, a citizens&#39; committee involved in city issuesThe square Casgrain being a private land occupied without the agreement of the owner, the collective must face issues of cohabitation on the land. In addition, a garage project for the Société de Transport de Montréal (STM) scheduled for 2021 threatens the brightness of the square and causes inconvenience related to the traffic of buses in the neighborhood. The collective is mobilizing in reaction to the site in 2018 with the City of Montreal. Steps are taken to try to guarantee the sustainability of the space by some members of the collective.Many local residents worried by the nuisance linked to the site appeal to the collective as an organ representing, despite itself, the district and as a privileged interlocutor of the public authorities. In fact, the collective was formed into a Citizens&#39; Committee of Bellechasse, to interact with the STM about the planned construction site adjacent to the Casgrain square [v]. This empty shell, useful for public letters and correspondence with official bodies, contributes to the organization of an information meeting in October 2018 with the residents concerned on the garage project in the neighborhood.Representation activities with municipal authorities are increasing in 2019 by a few citizens of the Casgrain square involved in a sub-group called Avenir du carré. Official bodies are called upon to ensure the sustainability of the space, which leads to a declaration of land reserve filed for the end of the park by the borough in April 2019 [vi]. Following this, the owner of the land proceeded with the destruction of the green space in October 2019 [vii].Organizational structure, membership and fundingOrganizational structureThe Casgrain square collective is an informal group open to everyone. The participation of all is welcome depending on availability, skills and desires. There is no obligation to take on tasks or attend a certain number of meetings. The group operates in a flexible and horizontal manner, around the operating principles of self-management. Thus, developments have been made according to the expertise of each member of the collective, and these developments in return generate the initiative of new participants [viii]. The visual image of the place was for example created thanks to the introduction of a graphic designer in the collective.If collective chores are organized, there is no obligation in the allocation of tasks within thegroup. The task management was initially done through a chain of emails and a monthly meeting under the chairmanship of the alley committee. Gradually, tasks are organized through digital management tools such as Google doc (for the watering calendar) or Slack which is gradually replacing monthly meetings. There are strong links between the members of the collective, who gather at the Cargrain Square as much for informal social activities as for the management of daily tasks.CollectiveThe collective is organized around a core of eight to ten people involved regularly, and about sixty people mobilized punctually during major chore-type events. To reach and mobilize residents for major events, leaflets are distributed to the neighborhood and events are created on Facebook through the “Carré et sa ruelle” page, used to raise awareness of the project and mobilize the community. community and archive the project history.Because of the squat status, the Casgrain square cannot officially seek subsidies or aid, hence the use of the green lane committee, recognized by the borough and the City, which adjoins the land. The links between the two projects are relatively strong and the members of the Green Lane committee participate more or less actively in the activities of the Casgrain square.Funding, donations and servicesUnder the umbrella of the alley committee, the Carré collects donations of compost, plants and bins from the borough, through municipal green lane support programs set up in collaboration with the Nature- organization. Action Quebec in Montreal. If the green lane committee is the official intermediary, the City nevertheless unofficially recognizes the Casgrain square and values the impacts of the project: the green lane committee obtained the first prize in the citizen innovation category as part of the green streets days of Montreal for the garden concept - public space open to all of the Carré Casgrain in September 2018.If the requests for funding from the borough or the City are not all accepted, the Carré Casgrain benefits from a network of donations of goods and services set up with local residents, community organizations and local businesses. Thus, construction and gardening equipment and plants are collected or donated, access to water and electricity are also offered by neighbors. The project budget is ultimately relatively low thanks to this recovery system in line with the philosophy of the project.Institutional issuesDue to the informal nature of the collective, the Casgrain square faces various challenges: a feeling of exhaustion due to the slowness of institutional relations, difficulty in entering into the framework of the funding programs offered, over-solicitation in an ecosystem where this type of project does not last long in the long term, acts of vandalism on the ground. However, these difficulties do not undermine the motivation of the collective and the recognition remains numerous. They demonstrate the legitimacy of the group, both institutional - in 2019, the City grants the Casgrain square land reserve status for the end of the park - and community - through discussions with citizens and organizations requesting the square for conferences or visits.Specializations, methods and toolsAs an informal and voluntary collective, the square Casgrain has not played a specific role of citizen participation since its creation. It rather acts as a citizen participation initiative as such, which is demonstrated in the appropriation and occupation of a vacant public space but also in the collective organization in self-management which is experienced on a daily basis. The square thus develops a deliberative space marked by the search for consensus and the empowerment of the citizens who take part in it, particularly in their relations with public authorities [ix].We can observe a process of citizen participation in practice through gardening activities but also through cultural events held in the Casgrain square. The approach is tested from the ideation and implementation of projects since the space is free to use by all those who wish it: decisions do not need to be validated unanimously by the  he group, although it is common to use meetings or collaborative management tools (Trello, Slack, Google doc, Facebook) to mention upcoming projects and solicit the involvement of the collective. Communication within the group is based on trust and benevolence in exchanges. Everyone is free to invest according to their possibilities and desires. Self-management over time promotes the multiplication of projects and their implementation in collaboration with a community and peer network.Regarding the methods of project implementation, let us mention a move towards cloud computing tools that reduce the frequency of meetings: previously monthly, meetings are now only held in the event of a crisis. Management is essentially carried out through the collaborative tool Slack allowing discussion channels to prioritize and organize conversations within the group according to the different projects. The participatory objective is also demonstrated in the attention to the inclusion of everything carried by the collective: thus, communication on social networks is coupled with communication by leaflet to reach populations who would not have access to the internet.In addition, the collective is also distinguished by the institutional relations supported with the borough and the City, with the objective of perpetuating the green space within the district. This approach creates a relay role for the information collected from local populations. Thus, the Bellechasse citizens&#39; committee was established, an empty shell that makes it possible to relay complaints from the community to competent authorities in the matter and to inform citizens in return of the responses obtained through a newsletter. In addition, the exchange maintained with municipal authorities helps to strengthen the legitimacy of the group, despite the illegal status of the occupation of the land. The granting of a reserve for the end of the park by the City makes it possible to see in the Casgrain square experience a form of institutionalization of the practice of greening vacant private land [x].Major projects and eventsInitiatives carried out: socialization activities and political mobilizations- Saint-Jean barbecue 2018: gathering of around thirty participants among the neighborhood around a potluck- Valentine&#39;s Day 2019: declaration of love squared manifested by poems on the advertising panels on the ground [xi]- Approaches to the Rosemont-Petite-Patrie borough to stabilize the presence and occupation of the collective on the Casgrain square: reserve for the end of the park granted in April 2019 by the City- Disappearance of the clothing recycling bins in the field following a complaint made by Carré Casgrain in the summer of 2019Supported initiatives: citizen mobilization at the neighborhood level- Citizen mobilization against the garage project of the Société de Transport de Montréal relayed on behalf of the Bellechasse citizens&#39; committee by the Carré CasgrainConsulting activities: permaculture, citizen initiatives and  placemaking- TD Park People Congress, which selects the Square for a visit as part of its pan-Canadian conference programming: visit by members of the collective in June 2019- 5à7 volunteering at the University of Quebec in Montreal: event presenting different volunteer initiatives, which asks the Square to promote the project in June 2019- Implementation of participatory citizen projects in living environments by the Montreal Ecology Center and the Rosemont-Petite-Patrie borough: conference on permaculture held by participants from the Casgrain square as part of the programming of the citizen project on the living environment.- Referencing of the Carré Casgrain within the framework of the Landes community organization&#39;s fact sheets on parks and citizen implications: selection from around twenty other projects chosen to equip citizens [xii]See as wellhttps://www.facebook.com/lecarreetsaruelle/References  -justify &quot;&gt;  Laurence Bherer, Pascale Dufour &amp; Françoise Montambeault (2016) The participatory democracy turn: an introduction, Journal of Civil Society, 12: 3, 225-230, DOI:10.1080 / 17448689.2016.1216383Annabelle Mazoyer (2018), “Sociological analysis of the emergence of the phenomenon of green alleys on the island of Montreal”, Mémoire, UQAM.Notes[i] Lande &amp; Solon, “Ecocitoyenne action laboratory”, June 2019, p.9.  https://landemtl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Lande_Solon_Labo_VF.pdf[ii]  https://faitescommechezvous.org/verdir/ruelles-vertes/[iii] Mazoyer Annabelle, Sociological analysis of the emergence of the phenomenon of green alleys on the island of Montreal, Mémoire, UQAM, November 2018, p. 82[iv] Lande &amp; Solon, “Ecocitoyenne action laboratory”, June 2019, p.9.  https://landemtl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Lande_Solon_Labo_VF.pdf[v] Colpron Suzanne, “A gigantic STM construction site is underway”,  La Presse,  April 11, 2019,  https://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/grand-montreal/201904/10/01-5221716- a-gigantic-site-of-the-stm-is-starting-in-motion.php  .[vi] Delacour Emmanuel, “Carré Casgrain: a first step towards a park”,  Metro  , April 5, 2019.  https://journalmetro.com/local/villeray-st-michel-parc-extension/2303828/carre-casgrain- a-first-step-towards-a-park /[vii] Cyr Guillaume, “A community space razed by the landowner”,  TVA Nouvelles  , October 7, 2019.  https://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2019/10/07/un-espace-communautaire-rase-par -the-land-owner[viii] Ibid. p. 109[ix] Bherer Laurence, Dufour Pascale and Montambeault Françoise, “The participatory democracy turn: an introduction”,  Journal of Civil Society  , 12: 3, 225-230.[x]  Ibid.[xi] Lasselin Camille, “When advertising harms beauty and citizen initiatives”,  HuffPost Québec Blogues  , February 15, 2019.  https://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/camille-lasselin/a  displays-publicite-nuit-  beaute- citizens-initiatives-carre-casgrain_a_23670646 /[xii] Lande &amp; Solon, “Ecocitoyenne action laboratory”, June 2019, p.9.  https://landemtl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Lande_Solon_Labo_VF.pdf",1,0,0,1,0,

Its mission is defined as follows:- Sustain the Champ des Possibles as a public green space and an urban biodiversity reserve- Promote and encourage popular education in natural sciences, history and the arts- Promote the creation of new green spaces and urban biocorridors.Since 2010, the organization has been working with citizens and the borough to develop a vision for the development of the Champ des Possibles and introduce the biodiversity of this urban wasteland to the public. [I]Origins and developmentThe land: an abandoned wasteland in the heart of Mile EndThe Champ des Possibles corresponds to a space of nearly one hectare in Montreal, in the eastern sector of the Mile End, bounded by the railway line to the north, avenue Henri-Julien to the east, the large buildings of the avenue de Gaspé to the west and the former Viandes Saint-Laurent site to the south. Formerly called Champ Maguire, the land was a quarry operated during the 18th and 19th century, which then gradually gave way to a pond and a dumping ground. Drownings in the pond led to fill the unsanitary space. It was then acquired by the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1905 for its proximity to the railway line established in 1876. The Canadian Pacific Railway installed a marshalling yard there in 1906 [ii]. Abandoned at the beginning of the 1990s, the space gradually became an urban wasteland in the heart of an industrial district where green spaces and vacant lots were scarce [iii]. Gradually, the place becomes a space of citizen appropriation with multiple uses: spontaneous gatherings, campfires, picnics, but above all a space of circulation, shortened for the users heading towards the metro [iv].A buyout project by the City: the construction of a public problemOwned by the Canadian Pacific Railway, the wasteland was approached by the City of Montreal for a buyout at the end of the 2000s [v]. The City&#39;s project is to transform the green space into a “truck yard” [vi  ]  , which involves concreting this green space contaminated by decades of industrialization. Citizen mobilization is important to counter the development of the project, while the 2009 municipal electoral campaign is in full swing. The elections constitute a window of opportunity to make visible the project to protect the urban wasteland of the Champ des Possibles.2007-2009: citizen mobilization for the recognition of green spaceIn 2006, the City of Montreal joined forces with the Plateau-Mont-Royal borough to propose the holding of a consultation process on the future of the Maguire sector, which notably includes the abandoned wasteland [vii]. Many experts then mobilized to demonstrate the economic and real estate potential of this rapidly transforming space, in particular by the establishment of the Ubisoft company in the sector in 1997. As for citizens, they mobilized to promote the ecological value, social and cultural activity of the Champ Maguire wasteland. The mobilization has grown thanks to three types of action:at. An artistic mobilization in the service of a cultural space:An artist, Emily Rose Michaud, created in November 2007 a collaborative  land art  work to draw the public&#39;s attention to the Champ Maguire and its value, develop citizen engagement around the site and question the destruction project planned by the City. Entitled the &quot;Roerich Garden&quot;, this work refers to the Roerich Pact, a symbol of the Second World War used to convey to pilots in charge of dropping bombs information on sites of great cultural importance [viii]. Emily Rose Michaud has joined forces with the “Sprout Out Loud” garden collective to maintain, thanks to a local citizen mobilization, a Roerich symbol made of plants and rocks all year round for three years [ix]. The project was documented by an electronic book, gathering 40 texts and 1000 images, illustrating the citizen appropriation of the space and the attentiwe give by citizens to their territory through the project [x]. The artistic citizen mobilization testifies to the cultural value of a wasteland and the space of possibilities created by a wild park in the heart of the city, considered too precious to be the object of disappearance.b. Scientific mobilization in the service of biodiversityMore than 413 visible plant and animal species have been identified on the Champ Maguire site [xi]. An expert in urban biodiversity, Roger Latour, surveys the wasteland to identify the different species in order to feed his own research in natural history. The project to destroy the green space planned by the City of Montreal prompted it to mobilize a community of biologists and horticulturalists in defense of the site&#39;s ecological value. They then demonstrate, through scientific research, the importance of protecting the urban biodiversity that is created on post-industrial sites like Champ Maguire.vs. Citizen mobilization in the context of a participatory approach initiated by the CityThe publication of the first development guidelines for the sector by the City and the borough in 2006, then the announcement of an investment of $ 9 million for an urban development project in the sector in 2008 led the citizens of the district gathered within the Mile End Citizens Committee to mobilize. This committee, founded in 1982, brings together 600 citizens involved in improving the quality of their neighborhood and demonstrates a mobilizing force over time. The Mile End Citizens&#39; Committee invites the Plateau-Mont-Royal borough to dialogue with citizens about the future of the sector. This takes the form of a public meeting on April 9, 2008, which initiates a participatory citizen approach at the initiative of the Citizens&#39; Committee [xii]. The latter is organizing a series of citizen gatherings between May 2008 and April 2009. The citizen approach combines surveys of the local population and users, thematic citizen cafes (transport, housing, culture, economy and services, heritage and environment), visits and exploratory walks in the sector which culminate in the organization of a citizens&#39; forum on April 26, 2009. Through a theatrical presentation of the challenges of the sector followed by small group discussions, the forum allowed the emergence of guiding ideas and concrete proposals for the sector. It gathered 130 participants. The Champ has been the subject of several concrete proposals, including the creation of a public square open to residents, artists and artisans, but also the preservation of its wild side through decontamination by natural means to conserve the existing green space [xiii].2009-2013: institutionalization of the collective approachat. A mobilization in the context of municipal electionsAn informal collective brings together citizen mobilizations to demonstrate the cultural, ecological and social qualities of Champ Maguire. This collective takes the name of the Friends of the Champ des Possibles, thus renaming the Champ Maguire for the many opportunities it brings to the citizens of the district. It undertakes to give shape to the priorities established by the citizen forum and works on the drafting of a vision of the future for the urban wasteland. The citizen forum process then continues with ideation carts. These allow the realization of architectural plans presented to the City and to the various candidates for the municipal elections in 2009. The citizen&#39;s vision of the future brings together the different aspects of citizen mobilization around 7 priorities: the protection of the heritage character, of biodiversity , artistic practices, the promotion of educational practices, recreational planning, the development of the scientific and environmental dimension and support for the participatory process [xiv].b. Recognition of the Friends of the Champ des Possibles as interlocutor and co-managerProjet Montréal, the only party to fully adhere to the project presented by the collective, won the elections for the Plateau-Mont-Royal borough in 2009. In order to establish a dialogue with the elected officials of the borough, the Friends of the Champ des Possibles was institutionalized in the form of a non-profit organization in 2010. Collaboration was initiated with the borough to ensure the preservation and advancement of the project. After three years of negotiation and a consultationIn 2012, an amendment to the Town Planning Plan and the Borough&#39;s Town Planning Regulations made it possible to perpetuate the Champ des Possibles in 2013 with the granting of a natural area zoning [xv]. A co-management agreement in partnership between the borough and the Friends of the Champ des Possibles was also signed in 2013 for the years 2014 to 2017. It defines the Champ des Possibles as a &quot;space for innovative experiments in terms of sustainable development and practices linked to the preservation of the natural character of the environment ”and recognizes the Friends of the Field of the Possibles as“ privileged interlocutor of the citizen mobilization and the promotion of events and activities ”[xvi  ]  .2013 - 2020: Developmentsat. The co-management partnershipFrom 2014 to 2017, external programming activities are planned by the co-management agreement at the expense of the Friends of the Champ des Possibles. The renewal of the agreement in 2017 allows the granting of $ 20,000 per year for 3 years to carry out activities of animation, surveillance and control of ragweed [xvii  ]  . The functioning of the co-management is based on the creation of a committee bringing together members of the borough, a member of the board of directors and the coordinator of the Friends of the Champ des Possibles [xviii  ]  . Thanks to the service agreement, Les Amis du Champ des Possibles were able to benefit from a place at the negotiating table to assert their vision of the site&#39;s development, but also from renewed financial support over time, which enabled them to subsequently seek other grants and consolidate their structure. The organization was thus equipped with a coordination and project manager position (in 2014 and 2015), was able to set up a strategic plan and increase collaborations. However, co-management reveals issues regarding the sustainability of funding, since the agreement has not been renewed since 2019 for lack of agreement on financial support from the borough [xix  ]  .b. The mission of preserving biodiversityThe Friends of the Champ des Possibles mission is to &quot;perpetuate the Champ des Possibles as a public green space and urban biodiversity reserve&quot; but also to &quot;promote the creation of new green spaces and urban corridors&quot; [xx]. To do this, many partnerships have been established in the community of the Saint-Viateur East sector. Their objectives are to sensitize, mobilize and inform users of the Champ des Possibles on the process of rehabilitation and conservation of space. The organization is also joining forces with a group of university researchers to put forward the innovative aspects of the rehabilitation project, to list the biodiversity present and to think about new ways of decontaminating the field.In fact, the co-management agreement between the Amis du Champ des Possibles and the borough involves joint work to establish a contaminated soil rehabilitation plan in order to protect the 160 trees from some twenty species [xxi  ]  . The Champ des Possibles project thus differs greatly from naturalized development approaches, which involve decontamination before leaving nature the right to expand in the wild. The Friends of the Champ des Possibles aim to find alternative ways to decontaminate, without massive intervention in wasteland. This approach first of all contravenes municipal regulations which impose the decontamination of natural parks frequented by the public [xxii  ]  and thus makes the specificity of the Champ des Possibles project.To protect and promote the biodiversity present at the Champ des Possibles, census and cataloging activities are regularly undertaken and brought together under the name of “bioblitz” [xxiii  ]  , in collaboration with biology professionals. A biodiversity catalog was thus produced in 2014, listing the different species of flora and fauna in the park. It was updated and published again in 2017. Additional documents were also compiled: an inventory of insects, a state of health of the flora of the site, recommendations on maintenance for the years to come, etc.To ensure the protection of organicdiversity present on the site, cleaning chores are organized with the help of volunteers. They are aimed at cleaning the site, managing the garbage cans and extermination of the ragweed present in mass at the Champ des Possibles. These chores are possible thanks to numerous partnerships with facilitating organizations, whether they are specialized in volunteering or social and professional integration activities for young people (Katimavik, YMCA, Diners St-Louis, etc.). Finally, in 2017, funding by the borough enabled the formation of a volunteer green patrol involved throughout the summer, in particular for the removal of ragweed, in collaboration with the Atchoum organization, which provides expertise on the eradication of this allergenic plant [xxiv].vs. The educational and cultural missionThe mission of the Friends of the Champ des Possibles also includes an educational and cultural component, in order to &quot;promote and encourage popular education in natural sciences, history and the arts&quot; [xxv]. From 2015, a reception kiosk was installed in the park using a container in order to get as close as possible to the public and users. Many activities are organized on the site, thanks to partnerships or self-managed initiatives [xxvi  ]  . Thus, at the Champ des Possibles, it is possible to practice yoga, dance, botanical drawing, attend screenings by Wapikoni Mobile or even participate in day camps with The lion and the mouse. Numerous awareness-raising activities concerning the problem of ragweed are also undertaken on the site with signage but also among residents of the area through the distribution of flyers in letter boxes. To make scientific publications accessible, educational efforts are being made, such as the biodiversity catalog which has been adapted into a coloring book, sold for the benefit of the organization.Finally, numerous outreach activities, in the form of conferences, guided tours and kiosks are organized with the academic and professional world to publicize the mission of the Friends of the Champ des Possibles and ensure mobilization around the project.Organizational structure, membership and fundingOrganizational structureInitially organized in the form of an informal committee, the Friends of the Champ des Possibles collective was institutionalized to gain legitimacy vis-à-vis the public authorities. Became a non-profit organization in 2010, then co-manager of the Champ des Possibles in 2013 in collaboration with the Le Plateau-Mont-Royal borough, the organization has since set up offices in 2016 within the Temps Libre Mile cooperative. End which adjoins the park.MembershipThe organization works by involving its members in sub-committees for the development of projects or for the annual management of the park (art, biodiversity, maintenance, etc.). In 2018, 424 members are part of the Friends of the Champ des Possibles [xxvii].The operation of the structure is made according to the time and energies of each, because of the voluntary status of the members. However, paid positions seem to have been filled from time to time within the organization since 2014. A development coordination position has been occupied since January 2014, while temporary and contractual positions have emerged in 2015 as well as in 2017: responsible for the management of volunteers, responsible and support for ecological maintenance, biologists and entomologists.If the Friends of the Champ des Possibles rely on the support of their members, the organization also draws its legitimacy within the Saint-Viateur Est sector by the organization of citizen consultations on substantive reflections on the future. of the park and the area. In collaboration with the Mile End Citizens&#39; Committee, the Friends of the Champ des Possibles therefore act as an intermediary between the municipal authorities, with which they share the co-management of the site, and the citizens and users of the Champ des Possibles.Co-management committeeAs the beneficiary of a service agreement with the borough, the Amis du Champ des Possibles must report to municipal authorities, which implies the implementation of strategic plans and reviews each year. Management in collaboration with the borough is made possible through a cog committeeestion, bringing together representatives of the borough and administrators of Friends of the Field of Possibilities [xxviii] to discuss issues related to the management of the site. The files handled by the management committee overlap with the site rehabilitation plan, development, waste management, uses and nuisances, control of invasive species and the restoration strategy. The rehabilitation of contaminated soils mainly occupies the committee, since the borough, the City of Montreal and the Friends of the Champ des Possibles must agree to submit a plan for the rehabilitation of contaminated soils to the Ministry of sustainable development, the environment. and the fight against climate change.Funding, donations and servicesThe main funding of the Amis du Champ des Possibles was provided by the service agreement signed with the borough, granting $ 60,000 over three years, from 2017 to 2019. However, this funding is not assured since the agreement that was to be renewed in 2020 has still not been the subject of an agreement, the borough no longer wishing to contribute financially to the maintenance and animation of the Champ des Possibles. To ensure the financial stability of the organization, the Friends of the Champ des Possibles have sought grants from various funding sources. Fundraising is aimed just as much at university research granting organizations, thanks to the many partnerships forged with the scientific community, as at private foundations such as the TD Friends of the Environment Foundation and WWF Canada which fund projects at the Champ des Possibles in 2018. Funding requests for employment subsidies were also filed in 2018 in order to hire mainly volunteer labor on the project [xxix].Other sources of funding were provided by the community. Thus, a crowdfunding campaign in 2015-2016 enabled the contribution of $ 20,000 from 140 donors. This success led to a renewal of the formula in a monthly format in 2017. In addition, membership fees to become a member also provide a source of income for the Friends of the Champ des Possibles. Finally, the sale of derivative products since 2017 (herbaria, coloring book, sweaters, catalog) also provides funding for the mission. Part of the offer of workshops provided by the Friends of the Champ des Possibles could constitute an avenue of financing also by the sale of services [xxx  ]  .Specializations, methods and toolsCo-management of the site: a major player in the negotiationsThe Friends of the Champ des Possibles mission is to perpetuate the urban biodiversity reserve that is the Champ des Possibles [xxxi]. As such, decontamination and securing of the site polluted by decades of industrialization can only be done gradually, with minimal human intervention in space. However, this operation is contrary to municipal regulations. Thus, the laws require the remediation of contaminated sites before any construction of new facilities intended for wide use of the public. Decontamination by excavation is thus very often recommended [xxxii]. In addition, the security standards for urban development stipulate lighting, accessibility and visibility requirements. These two standards are contrary to the objectives of the Friends of the Field of Possibles project [xxxiii]. The co-management agreement therefore involves negotiations not only in the development, maintenance and animation of the site but also in the procedures and ways of doing municipal authorities. The fight led by the Friends of the Champ des Possibles could thus renew the protocols for the management of contaminated sites in Quebec by &quot;thinking them differently&quot; [xxxiv].In order to weigh in the negotiations and to be considered as a legitimate interlocutor of the public authorities, various strategies have been developed by the Friends of the Field of the Possibles.The first consists in the institutionalization of the mobilized collective into a structured non-profit organization. Thus, the demands are transformed into action plans, transposing the space of struggles into a language and a form understood by public powers.The second strategy deployed is to join forces with academia to promote the importance of biodiversity on the Champ des Possibles site. Citizen mobilization to defend the natural park project at Champ des Possibles was, among other things, initiated by a biologist who used the site as a reclaiming ground.search. Reconciliations with the scientific world continued thereafter, making it possible in particular to standardize the approaches and make the census procedures more rigorous by setting up a scientific protocol for data collection. But the work with scientists has also and above all made it possible to frame the mobilization in a scientific register, in order to gain legitimacy vis-à-vis the public authorities. The Friends of the Champ des Possibles thus seek to supervise and monitor the development of the project on the site in collaboration with universities. The avenues of research aim to develop a restoration plan based on a type of management different from that of urban parks, based on the idea that the site is alive and growing. “Ecological restoration focuses on creating the conditions necessary for the growth and evolution of a site as a living and changing system, intervening only as needed, and in order to offer greater diversity and resilience in the face of challenges [xxxv] ”. By translating the aspirations of the Friends of the Champ des Possibles into scientific language, the partnership with universities will be able to help offer clear orientations legitimized by university expertise with the City in order to modify park management practices.Finally, the Friends of the Champ des Possibles also rely on a citizen mobilization strategy by positioning themselves as an interlocutor between municipal authorities and the local population. In partnership with local organizations, such as the Mile End Citizens&#39; Committee, Espaces Temps or the Pépinière, the Friends of the Champ des Possibles are developing citizen consultation processes that legitimize the word they speak to the borough. This representational role is notably materialized during an Agora des Possibles project, set up between Espaces Temps, the Friends of the Champ des Possibles and Temps Libre Mile End and supported by the Le Plateau-Mont-Royal borough. The project aims to &quot;amplify citizen initiatives&quot; by stimulating the implementation of external interventions and offering a resource counter providing information on community projects within the district. The temporary developments proposed within the framework of Agora des Possibles were punctuated by mediation workshops and areas of free expression allowing dialogue between citizens and project leaders about the preliminary redevelopment plans of the areas invested. The Friends of the Champ des Possibles aimed by their participation in the mediation workshops to stimulate a critical mind in the face of the facilities offered to the public [xxxvi]. These consultation activities are regular for the organization, which in 2020 is starting a partnership with Concordia and McGill universities in order to understand the profile of users of the Champ des Possibles and understand the different uses of space [xxxvii]. Through this role of intermediary between the municipal authorities and the citizens of the district, the Friends of the Champ des Possibles benefit from a legitimacy from below vis-à-vis the public authorities.Major projects and eventsInitiatives carried out:- Chores: cleaning and maintenance of the space, plantations, control of invasive species, training of a volunteer maintenance team- Animation: census, guided tours, species identification workshops, botanical illustration, courses and scientific popularization on biodiversity, distribution of flowers, cinema, exhibition- Outreach activities: conferences, information kiosksSupported initiatives:- Citizen consultations and participatory co-design workshops- Animation in collaboration with sector organizationsPublicationsLes Amis du Champ des Possibles, “Activity Report 2014-2015”,  http://champdespossibles.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rapport-dactivitc3a9_acdp_2014-20151.pdf  .Les Amis du Champ des Possibles, “2017 Activity Report”,  http://champdespossibles.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rapport-dactivitecc81s_acdp_20171.pdfFriends of the Field of Possibilities, &quot;Project Report 2017&quot;,  1  December 2017.  http://champdespossibles.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rapport-2017_convention-pmr-acdp.pdfFriends ofu Champ des Possibles, “2018 Activity Report”,  https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn%3Aaaid%3Ascds%3AUS%3Adaea44ed-8162-4e89-9a18-fae1eea42f7b#pageNum=1Les Amis du Champ des Possibles, 2019 Activity Report  https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn%3Aaaid%3Ascds%3AUS%3A00ad5a44-8397-4168-878f-0ef5532e724c#pageNum=7See as wellhttps://champdespossibles.org/https://www.facebook.com/amisduchampdespossibles/http://roerichproject.artefati.ca/Notes[i] Les Amis du Champ des Possibles, 2019 Activity Report.  https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn%3Aaaid%3Ascds%3AUS%3A00ad5a44-8397-4168-878f-0ef5532e724c#pageNum = 7[ii] Yves Desjardins, “The &#39;past past&#39; of the Champ des Possibles”, Mémoire du Mile End, 2019.  http://memoire.mile-end.qc.ca/fr/le-passe-anterieur-du-champ -of-possible /[iii] City of Montreal, Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, “Secteur Maguire.

It allowed the expropriation of the owner of the vacant lot at the intersection of 4  e  avenue and rue Masson in Montreal, as well as the purchase by the City of the green space now co-managed between the borough and the citizens of the district. According to the principles of participatory town planning and budgeting, the objectives of the project are as follows:Reveal the potential of spaceEngage citizens and the local community in the democratic appropriation of their living environmentBuild local knowledge on this site, and document the appropriation procedures and the site management model· Set up a process based on collective intelligence using a collaborative logic between citizens, local organizations, elected officials and professionals [i].Origins and developmentVacant land expropriated by the City in 2017The land, located in the Rosemont-La-Petite-Patrie borough in Montreal, has been left vacant for several decades. The space being used as a waste deposit, issues of sanitation and delinquency lead to the intervention of the borough, which wishes to buy back the fallow space to make a park [ii]. The land is evaluated at a cost of $ 141,300 by the City. In the absence of an agreement with the owner, the borough pleads for an expropriation by the City. The cost of the expropriation and the work required on the land is estimated at $ 400,000 [iii]. The City proceeded with the expropriation in 2017 and the land then returned to the borough.A co-design process in collaboration with community organizations and citizens (2017-2018)The borough wishes to develop the wasteland in collaboration with the citizens of the district: the project constitutes the first citizen participation initiative piloted between the borough and the citizens. To do this, the borough is inspired by participatory budget experiences and mandates the community organization Lande as well as the Urban Ecology Center to jointly carry the initiative. The project takes the name of Hollow Dents and is based on an “iterative formula for transforming vacant land through temporary interventions” [iv]. The ideation and co-design of the site take place from June to September 2018 and residents of the neighborhood are invited to come up with ideas for transforming the space into a park, reflecting the neighborhood and its needs. About ten citizens took part in the entire process, from the ideation workshops to the final development, carried out following a vote by residents of the neighborhood. Three projects were submitted to the district&#39;s vote: an art and biodiversity trail, a ludic and green relaxation area and a meeting and gathering space. It is the proposal for the development of a ludic and green relaxation area that has attracted the greatest number of people in this family neighborhood. The development involves in this regard the construction of a vertical green wall, the presence of Adirondack chairs and hammock support and finally a space for free play. Voting could be done online on the Réalisons Montréal [v] page, in businesses adjacent to the future park or even in the project area during organized voting days. It is important to note that the vote was open to residents of the area aged 12 and over [vi].L&#39;Îlot des murmures, the first project and model of citizen participation in co-managementOriginally called Îlot de la 4  e  , the green space transformed by citizens was inaugurated on September 15, 2018. It is now called the Îlot des murmures. There is a grassy area, a green wall, tubs of edible plantations and furniture to take a break and socialize [vii  ]  . The place is also intended to be a space animated by the residents of the district: surveys on the collective&#39;s Facebook page are launched to develop activities and events in response to the needs and desires of the inhabitants of the area. Among the activities offered are yoga classes, picnics, storytelling readings as well as workshops (fermentation, microgreens, etc.).This project is the first participatory initiativeWe are a citizen piloted between the Rosemont-La-Petite-Patrie borough and the citizens. The project will also benefit in 2019 from the support of the borough&#39;s “Citizen participatory projects” program. This program aims to facilitate the implementation of projects by citizens in their living environments. The borough&#39;s support then made it possible to improve the existing facilities and to make the park more green. The experience of the Îlot des murmures is also a model for citizen initiatives, as demonstrated in particular by its regular mention by groups of citizens mobilized in other spaces [viii  ]  , by its highlighting on the promotional video. of the Citizen Participatory Projects program [ix  ]  and by the awarding of a group volunteering prize in 2019 by the Montreal Urban Ecology Center as part of the Volunteer Recognition Gala in Montreal.Organizational structure, membership and fundingOrganizational structureThe organizational structure is relatively flexible for this initiative. Its particularity is to be supervised and driven by the Rosemont-La-Petite-Patrie borough and managed by two community organizations, Lande and the Montreal Urban Ecology Center. As such, the Îlot des murmures is the first citizen participation project co-managed by the borough and by citizens.The Lande organizations and the Montreal Urban Ecology Center (CÉUM) play a facilitating role to allow citizens to develop their own projects [x]. Lande&#39;s mission is to facilitate the citizen reappropriation of vacant land in Montreal, by promoting innovative approaches to participatory democracy [xi] while the CÉUM helps to equip citizens and organizations to create a city on a human scale, generating solutions to act on current challenges [xii]. The project jointly developed between Lande and the CÉUM, Les dents creuses, aims to transform “vacant municipal land through an approach inspired by the participatory budget to generate and carry out citizen projects for the development of public space” [xiii ]. L&#39;Îlot des murmures is the first co-creation initiative resulting from the Dents creuses project and supported by a Montreal borough. It was one of the first projects supported by the Rosemont-La-Petite-Patrie Citizen Participatory Projects program, in order to reproduce this type of initiative in other sectors of the borough.The support of the organizations Lande and CÉUM allows a flexible structure for the citizens invested in the Îlot des murmures. They can benefit from the benefits accorded to registered community nonprofits - such as receiving grants - through sponsorship from Lande and CÉUM, without having to set up their own organizational structure and meet the rigid frameworks required for them. NPO. A certain flexibility in the organizational structure was therefore demonstrated within the framework of the project. To cite an example, let us note the granting of a right to vote within the project to any citizen of the neighborhood aged 12 years and over [xiv].MembershipL&#39;Îlot des murmures is based on a flexible and relatively informal collective: the conditions for being part of it are not very restrictive. All you have to do is fill out a declaration of interest form available on  Google Forms  , or mention your participation to a manager in charge of an activity or even come to the scene for an event. The collective works around a hard core of ten people involved throughout the process of ideation and planning of the space. It also joins and mobilizes the community of neighborhood residents, called upon from time to time for chore-type activities or to vote for project ideas they want to see happen. To guarantee the involvement of neighborhood residents as a priority, mobilization is carried out according to residence criteria and through different communication vectors: local facebook groups, facebook page of the Îlot aux murmures, leaflets in shops, word of mouth as well as through the “bike with ideas” [xv], a mobile citizen participation kiosk initiated by the CÉUM to pedal directly to meet citizens.Committees and sub-committees are set up to carry out the various projects and tasks of the collective, overseen by the citizens&#39; committee bringing together the volunteersinvolved in the maintenance of the space and by the management committee. They meet monthly to ensure the maintenance and animation of the space. Their operation is based on democratic and non-hierarchical principles of self-management.Funding, donations and servicesL&#39;îlot des murmures benefits from several supports which have enabled the development of the project. Les Dents creuses was launched thanks to the support of Je fais Mtl and the Rosemont-La-Petite-Patrie borough, which notably enabled the municipal redemption of the land from the owner. The project benefited from grants, notably from the City of Montreal, which supported the development of the project up to $ 20,000 in 2018, with the support of the local Desjardins caisse which also provided $ 2,000. These investments made it possible to animate the codesign process with citizens and to promote the final development by residents of the area. The City also provided furniture, including swings and Adirondack chairs to furnish the park. As part of the Citizen Participatory Projects program, the borough granted an additional $ 10,000 in support to the initiative in 2019, in order to improve the site&#39;s development.The Îlot des murmures also benefits from a system of donations and services by the local community, mobilized around the project. The facebook group l&#39;Îlot des murmures de la 4e thus identifies many offers of assistance and services from the citizens of the district, in the form of donations of seeds, materials, etc.Specializations, methods and toolsParticipatory method: co-creation and co-management of the siteThe Les Dents creuses project specializes in citizen co-creation approaches with the expertise of Lande community organizations and the Montreal Urban Ecology Center. The objective of the project is to support and equip communities to appropriate their living environment and co-create public space from vacant municipal spaces. The co-creation process proposed by Les Dents creuses is short and intense and is based on the principles of the participatory budget to engage the community and citizens in the democratic appropriation of public space. All the development phases of the greening project involve citizens, elected officials and local organizations in a collaborative logic.L&#39;îlot des murmures is the pilot project of the Les Dents creuses project. Here are the stages of the process and the various achievements made between May and September 2018:- Call and ideation: what are the needs?o Two needs identification kiosks.o Ideation workshops bring together citizens mobilized during face-to-face meetings, in order to collectively define the basic values of the project and the common rules. An idea bike travels the neighborhood to meet citizens and collect their suggestions.- Development of citizen proposals - craftsman workshopo 3 collective project development workshops- Face-to-face and online exhibition - votingo 2 polling kiosks, 2 polling stations and one online vote (219 citizens votes)- Design of the prioritized projecto 1 priority project design workshop- Realization of projectso 7 weeks of project implementation and an inaugural activityMore than 800 hours of volunteer work were carried out to bring about the Îlot des murmures park. The project brought together the local community, as demonstrated by the 219 citizens&#39; votes to elect the development proposal to be prioritized [xvi], but also the presence of nearly 200 members on the Îlot des murmures Facebook group, and 180 members on the Facebook page. Based on the Citizen Participatory Projects approach, the borough&#39;s program supporting the project in 2019, the citizen collective relies on the mobilization of a given sector, defined as a place of life under the name of Masson Village. The initiative therefore aims to federate a community at the local level, which is also demonstrated by the limitation of votes to residents of the sector neighboring the future developed space.A fois the landscaped park, it is now up to citizens to assume co-management with the borough of Montreal. Monthly meetings then bring together the committees to ensure the good democratic management of the space. The methods used throughout the project development process and for which the mobilized citizens were equipped by Hollow Dents have since been incorporated into the management of the site. We can thus mention the regular holding of brainstorms and online surveys to make democratic decisions on site development or animation.Scope of the projectThe Hollow Dents project arose out of discussions held during workshops organized by Faire Montréal which aimed to support the realization of creative projects offering innovative tools to citizens to act and transform the city [xvii]. In this regard, Les Dents creuses offers &quot;a democratic and participatory solution to the urban problem of vacant land&quot;, a key issue in Montreal [xviii]. It thus makes it possible to offer a management model for a participatory experience involving citizens in all stages of the development and management of the project. The objective of the Dents creuses is to apply this co-creation process in all Montreal boroughs.Major projects and events- Initiatives carried out:o Chores: cleaning and maintenance of the space, plantations, construction of furnitureo Festive events: Picnics, sugar shack, children&#39;s play activitieso Workshops and courses: micro shoot, yoga, fermentation- Supported initiatives: citizen and activist mobilizationo Support for the local community: competitions organized with local businesseso Militant activities related to the environment and climate change: procession during demonstrations for the climate, signing of petitions, declaration of climate emergencyPublicationsCÉUM, “Hollow teeth, a vacant space transformed by a co-creation approach inspired by the participatory budget”, 2018.  https://cdn.ca.yapla.com/company/CPYO9qxj5LhP6vbo8lrLkiEO/asset/files/FPRO_LDC-Rosemont_20181125.pdfLande &amp; Solon, “Eco-citizen action laboratory”.

It aims at the collective reappropriation of the old railway right-of-way at the corner of rue St -Urbain and Beaubien in the Rosemont-Petite-Patrie borough in Montreal. The Friends of the Gorilla Park want to restore the natural and wild character of the old wasteland, in order to develop a public park there with, by and for the community of the Marconi-Alexandra sector. To do this, the approach is based on the principles of social ecology, wishing to put &quot;the social and ecological dimensions at the forefront of responsible urban development in line with the needs and aspirations&quot; of the district  [i]  .The objectives of the organization are as follows:o Restore the natural and wild character of the old Canadian Pacific railway right-of-wayo Develop and maintain a green and public space, intended to improve the urban environment, promote urban biodiversity and enhance the natural and human heritage of the neighborhood  [ii]Origin and developmentsThe land: an abandoned railway right-of-wayThe land located in the Rosemont-Petite-Patrie borough, in the Marconi-Alexandra district, between Saint-Zotique streets to the north, Beaubien to the south, Saint-Urbain and Waverly was a railway right of way of the Canadian railway company. Pacific since the end of the 19th century. The land of more than 5,000 square meters was abandoned by the company in the 1990s and was replaced by wasteland in the wild. The site has been re-appropriated as a green space by the residents of the district, in an area with little greenery and particularly affected by heat islands [iii]. The name of the Gorilla Park was attributed to the site, in reference to the aspect of urban jungle that it represents in the middle of the city [iv].A sector deforested by the owner: the construction of the public problemIn 2013, Canadian Pacific sold the land to developer Olymbec who, without authorization or permit, felled some fifty trees and carried out earthworks. The answer is twofold: the borough of Rosemont-Petite-Patrie and the City of Montreal give the owner a statement of offense, while residents mobilize in the face of deforestation to organize the conversion of the site into a public space. It is in this context and to defend this cause that the informal committee of Friends of the Gorilla Park was created in 2013. The collective arose out of the popular demonstration in reaction to the deforestation of the land, now covered with gravel.2013-2017: mobilization to protect urban green spaceThe mobilization of citizens leads to the imposition of a land reserve for the end of the park by the borough from 2013. The objective is then to prevent the developer from implementing a construction project on the site. The group of AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles is then defined by a work of “political lobbying” with the bodies in charge of the file [v]. To do this, the demands of the citizen collective are in line with the priorities established for the sector by the Urban, Economic and Social Development Plan (PDUES) of the Rosemont-Petite-Patrie borough [vi] which already provides for a park in the area. west of Saint-Laurent Boulevard. In addition, the AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles committee, although informal, works in close collaboration with two formal bodies mandated by the borough, namely the Regroupement des tables de concertation de la Petite-Patrie and the Société de développement environnement de la Petite-Patrie. Rosemont (SODER). Thus, the demands of the committee to make this issue known can find an echo with interlocutors close to the public authorities.From 2014, the borough formally undertakes to create a park in co-management with the residents of the district on the site of the Parc des Gorilles. Relations with the borough were facilitated by the direct link with SODER and by a favorable reception from the mayor of the borough, whom he met on several occasions. Regarding relations with the city center, the collective was able to meet the officials in charge of the file three times between 2013 and 2017 [vii]. A pressure campaign was put inworks to change the negotiations before the expiration of the land reserve for the end of the park.The committee&#39;s vision for the park is regularly put forward, whether by the drafting of a manifesto by the AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles in 2014 [viii] or by consulting the district on the creation of development prototypes. for the site in 2015. Two development proposals emerge, synthesized with the collaboration of the Eco-neighborhood Rosemont-Petite-Patrie. They mainly aim to make the Gorilla Park an ultra local area of wild biodiversity [ix]. These co-creation, formalization and documentation efforts implemented by the AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles bear witness to the proposed co-management approach between the City and the committee. In 2015, a prize awarded by the grouping of Eco-Quartiers for the organization&#39;s 20th anniversary attests to the recognition and legitimacy granted to the Committee of Friends of the Gorilla Park.While the City is trying to negotiate with the Olymbec company that owns the land, residents are reclaiming the park through actions to occupy and animate the space. Thus, cleaning chores, gardening activities in tubs, social activities such as picnics or barbecue, and heritage transmission activities such as guided tours (Jane&#39;s walks in particular [x]) or walks are organized. in kind [xi]. Relations with the owner remain stormy since he refuses citizen appropriation, although transitory, of the space. In 2015, Olymbec thus issued a formal notice to two members of the Committee of Friends of the Gorilla Park to remove the urban agriculture bins and the temporary furniture installed [xii]. The committee is turning to ad hoc occupancy actions during events such as Parking Day, which aims to reflect on the issues relating to the use of parking spaces in Montreal. The occupations of the space then aim to challenge passers-by and mobilize residents on the issue of the site, inform about its history and promote the actions of the collective.2017-2021: institutionalization and participatory approach in the management of the future Gorilla ParkOn March 13, 2017, the Rosemont-Petite-Patrie borough council voted to expropriate Olymbec, for park purposes, for lack of common ground obtained through negotiation attempts by the City. If the transaction is effected at a cost of $ 250,000 [xiii], the City has made a provision of $ 5.4 million to cover the costs of acquiring and developing the site [xiv].In reaction to this first victory, the Committee of Friends of the Gorilla Park was formed in September 2017 as a non-profit organization (NPO) and held its first general assembly. The organization&#39;s mandate is to prepare the ground for the redevelopment of a park in co-management with the borough of Rosemont-Petite-Patrie. The institutionalization of the committee as an NPO then aims to ensure negotiation with the public authorities in the development of the park. Once constituted as an NPO, the AmiEs du parc des Gorilles demand a meeting with the political leaders involved in the file as well as a contractual document stipulating a co-management agreement to ensure the &quot;delegation to the organization of the responsibilities of maintenance and animation of the site and the installations of the future park ”[xv].In this regard, the co-management agreement as discussed provides for the collaboration of the public authorities with the organization of the AmiEs du Parc des Gorille on several levels: the development of the redevelopment of the park with the citizens of the sector to meet the needs. of the citizens on the site, as well as a legacy of the maintenance of the space to the residents. This model of governance through public participation responds to an opening up of the production of public action to new actors alongside the public authorities. There is then a decentralization of the provision of services to external actors, such as private companies or non-profit organizations [xvi], such as the AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles. Collaboration between citizens engaged and organized in NPOs allows the sharing of collective decision-making but carries a risk of disengagement of the State and delegation of the management of public spaces to weakened entities because not funded and voluntary.The efforts to formalize a site redevelopment proposal led the AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles to receive the special mention of the jury during the competition.rs of the Urban Design Association of Quebec (ADUQ) in 2017 for the installation “Redesigning the Saint-Urbain / Beaubien intersection” during Park (ing) Day Montreal. The installation was carried out in collaboration with other informal community and collective organizations in Montreal.In 2019, the “political lobbying” work of the AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles led to the implementation of a citizen participation process linked to the development of the future park, in collaboration with the City and the borough. It materializes the NPO&#39;s efforts towards a co-management agreement, although it has still not been signed. But the consultation process is also part of a major urban project to redevelop an industrial wasteland in the Outremont sector and its surroundings, under the name of the MIL Montreal project [xvii]. This development project is led by the City of Montreal in partnership with the University of Montreal and represents nearly $ 175 million.Regarding the Gorilla Park sector, the citizen participation approach takes shape in space co-design workshops as well as online surveys with residents of the sector. The consultation process will continue throughout 2020, to make way for work on the site in 2021.In addition to the consultation process carried out with the City, the AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles organization organizes festive and cultural activities on the site of the Parc des Gorilles to inform and mobilize the neighborhood as well as local stakeholders. We can mention in this regard the realization of a mural representing an urban jungle in August 2018, the organization of a street party entitled &quot;Bloc Party&quot; in a musical and festive atmosphere in August 2019 as well as the holding of a retrospective exhibition. artistic and activist interventions by AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles in October 2019.Organizational structure, membership and fundingInitially organized in the form of an informal committee, the AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles collective has gradually become institutionalized to gain legitimacy vis-à-vis the public authorities. It was incorporated into a non-profit organization in 2017 and set up offices, located near the Gorilla Park, on Waverly Street.MembershipMembership within the NPO is based on a principle of proximity to the park. The organization thus defines three types of members, namely the status of regular members for people domiciled in the sector; the status of associate members for people whose workplace is located in the sector and finally the status of sympathetic members for people who do not correspond to the first criteria [xviii]. If any member has the right to speak, the draft resolutions must be proposed and seconded by a regular member to be put to a vote, which aims to ensure the representativeness of residents within the organization.If the organization operates with a membership system, it was established in 2019 since a first membership campaign was organized in October 2019. Since the committee began, it should be noted that the various activities organized have spontaneously mobilized up to two hundred citizens of the neighborhood and elsewhere.Board of directorsMade up of five to seven people, the board of directors brings together profiles with skills that are beneficial to the organization. Thus, between 2017 and 2020 there followed one another in particular an urban planner - designer, a journalist, two landscape architects and planning consultants and visual artists. It should also be noted the presence of a representative of SODER, then of Réseau Quartiers Vertes of the Montreal Urban Ecology Center, confirming the partnership with these two organizations [xix]. Relatively stable, the board of directors relies on a core of five people involved from the start in the preservation of space [xx].FundingThe AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles organization, once incorporated as an NPO, now requires funds. A campaign to join the NPO is organized in October 2019. The search for funding also leads to the allocation of a $ 3,000 scholarship by participants in the participatory budget &quot;Round trip&quot; organized by the provincial deputy of sector, Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois for the allocation of his discretionary budget. The sum offered to the Friends of the Gorilla Park will allow &quot;the organization of cultural and social activitiess aiming to bring together and mobilize the community around the park project ”[xxi].Specializations, methods and toolsPolitical lobbying: advocacy with elected officialsMeans deployedLes AmiEs du parc des Gorilles specializes in political lobbying activities with institutions. Indeed, formalization as a non-profit organization aims to play a mediating role between the citizens of the sector and the borough. To requests to meet with elected officials to advance the acquisition and management of the park, Les AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles put pressure on elected officials by several means, such as meeting requests, speeches during city council meetings of the City of Montreal but also massive sending of emails or letters to politicians.These advocacy activities require the support of citizens around the project, to gain legitimacy with elected officials and support lobbying activities. Thus, to inform and mobilize passers-by and residents of the area, the Friends of the Gorilla Park also organize various actions around the park: speaking out on the site, spontaneous groups organized to denounce the work by the owner, mobilizations on social networks and various festive and artistic activities such as a musical parade in the streets of the district to distribute pamphlets on the situation of the park for example [xxii].Framing of mobilizationsLes AmiEs du parc des Gorilles asked their partners to make their voices heard by elected officials and municipal councilors. Collaborations are in this sense crucial and also come to determine the form that the collective struggles take. Thus, the Rosemont Environmental Development Society (SODER) played a leading role with the collective, one of its members being involved from the start of the mobilization within the Friends of the Gorilla Park. By acting as an intermediary with the representatives of the borough, SODER has enabled the collective&#39;s demands to find an institutional voice that has made the fight for the restoration of green space gain credibility. In addition, the support provided by SODER has greatly contributed to the institutionalization of the collective through the evolution of the mission and its constitution as an NPO [xxiii].An institutionalization strategy chosen among othersThe institutionalization of the collective responds to a change in strategy since the first activities of the collective consisted of occupying the space of the old park in an informal way, in particular by transitional arrangements on the site. While the owner Olymbec sends a formal notice to two members of the collective, Les AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles decide to change tactics. Rather than mobilizing the community on the site to counter the owner&#39;s actions, the collective is moving towards advocacy with the municipal authorities in charge of the file.Bringing its demands to the institutional scene then leads to a formalization of collective practices. To ensure their long-term mobilization, the AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles are adopting a new tactic of political advocacy and framing their demands in a formal approach consistent with the plans and priorities of the borough for the sector. To do this, the collective relies on institutional documents such as the Urban, Economic and Social Development Plan (PDUES) of the Rosemont-Petite-Patrie borough [xxiv] which provides for a park on the site of the old abandoned wasteland.Thanks to the institutionalization of the struggles, the AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles organization is calling for joint management of the green space in collaboration with the borough. Co-management thus constitutes the culmination of a political lobbying process to legitimize the collective as a formal partner of municipal authorities.Major projects and eventsInitiatives carried outMay 2013: informal constitution of the collective and occupation of the space following the felling of fifty trees by the owner2014: drafting of a manifesto2015: district consultation on the prototyping of co-constructed development solutions for the park&amp; nbsp; September 2016: occupation of the site as part of the Parking DayMarch 2017: political pressure campaign 100 days before the expiration of the land reserve7,000 people watching a pressure video2017: constitution as a non-profit organization Les AmiEs du Parc des GorillesJuly 2019: exploratory walk and cleaning chore on the siteOctober 2019: The Art of Gorillas - exhibition and cocktail50 participantsCollaborative initiativesSeptember 2017: Installation “Redrawing the Saint-Urbain / Beaubien intersection” as part of Parking Day, in collaboration with the Montreal Bike Coalition, the Montreal Regional Environmental Council, Copenhagenize Design Co., Pedestrians Quebec and Vélo Ghost Montreal.August 2018: Mural produced in collaboration with SODER25 people presentJune 2019: Open house, launch of the participatory approach and citizen walk in collaboration with the City200 participantsAugust 2019: Bloc Party - Gorilla street party in collaboration with the City and the borough.75 people participatingRecognitions, representation and advisory activities2015: prize by the grouping of Eco-Quartiers for the Committee of Friends of Gorilla Park.2017: special mention of the jury during the competition of the Urban Design Association of Quebec (ADUQ) for the installation “Redesigning the Saint-Urbain / Beaubien intersection” during Park (ing) Day Montreal.2019: participation in the Park People Webinar on the three stages of creating a group &quot;Friends of the park&quot;2019: Case study conducted by Concordia students in the Urban Laboratory of the Department of Geography, Urban Planning and Environment in collaboration with Le Monde Festival  [xxv]  .PublicationsLes AmiEs du parc des Gorilles, “Le parc des Gorilles, towards a co-managed space”, working document, 2014.http://www.parcdesgorilles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/document-de-travail_parc-des-gorilles.pdfEco-neighborhood Rosemont - La Petite-Patrie For the Friends of the Parc des Gorilles, “The Gorilles disembark.

The objectives of Oasis Bellechasse are as follows:- Animation of public spaces and strengthening of the social fabric- Calming traffic and securing the neighborhood- Citizen reappropriation, neighborhood vitality and improvement of the quality of life- Greening of the city [i]Origins and developmentThe living environment: A little-frequented public square and an area of strong citizen mobilizationThe “Our living environments” project was initiated in October 2016 by Solon, Coop Carbone, the UQAM Research Chair on ecological transition and the Center for the Study of Social Responsibility and Ecocitizenship. Solon is in charge of the mobilization capacity and the co-creation process of the project, Coop Carbone is in charge of technical expertise, the UQAM Research Chair on ecological transition participates in project documentation and knowledge transfer, in conjunction with the Center for Social Responsibility and Eco-citizenship [ii]. These organizations constitute a steering committee, in charge of identifying living environments within which to mobilize citizens [iii]. The choice of the district in which to deploy the citizens&#39; initiative is therefore up to the organizations facilitating the project.The “living environment” refers to the different targets targeted by the project: a certain degree of citizen mobilization, a diversity of socioeconomic profiles, a diversity of commercial vitality, diversity in access to collective mobility and the presence of others. facilitating conditions [iv]. Two areas of intervention are selected following this evaluation by the steering committee, including the Bellechasse sector. The latter was chosen for the presence of a strong citizen mobilization on the territory, which is expressed in particular by the many projects of green alleys in the district [v]. These also testify to a degree of cooperation between citizens and the district, open to participatory approaches in the management of public space.The location chosen for the Bellechasse sector project corresponds to a public square with little traffic. Place Hector-Prud&#39;homme is located at the entrance to Plaza Saint-Hubert, in an area with high commercial density. Inaugurated in 2009 by the City of Montreal, this mineral square was designed as a multipurpose space &quot;which also allows for the holding of various community and entertainment activities&quot; [vi].A process of co-creating a vision for the futureTo follow up on the selection phase of living environments, the Solon organization, in cooperation with local partners, and more specifically by the green lane committees of the sector, mobilized the citizens of the Bellechasse sector to hold 8 workshops. discussion between April and August 2017. The objective of the meetings was to produce a diagnosis of the living environment, formulate motivations for carrying out the project and define projects to be carried out. Field visits completed the participatory system aimed at co-constructing visions of the future for the Bellechasse sector.If the district is considered friendly and pleasant by the participants, it is also a victim of security and traffic issues. The motivations for the project are therefore aimed at slowing down traffic, improving safety and greening the living environment. Among the projects proposed in response to the targeted issues: alley chores, developments protecting pedestrians and cyclists and guaranteeing them safe mobility, night lighting in the alleys. The vision offuture developed at the end of the workshops focuses on &quot;the animation of public spaces, calming traffic and anchoring in an urban fabric marked by a major shopping street&quot; [vii]. The project mainly brings together citizens who are already active, involved in other collective projects [viii].A lively public squareAt the end of the discussions, the citizens of the neighborhood are supported in the development of collective solutions for the neighborhood. Among the projects proposed for the Bellechasse sector, it is the development of a public square as a lively meeting place within the district that is selected. The Oasis Bellechasse thus takes place in February 2018 in the Hector-Prud&#39;homme public square.The reflections initiated during the project are extended by seven participating citizens who constitute the collective of the Oasis Bellechasse project. “Collective Wednesdays”, carried by the citizens of the collective, bring together once a month the citizens of the district to discuss the issues of the living environment, the animation and the management of the public square. Thus, the co-management approach is continued beyond the “Our living environments” project.The Oasis Bellechasse is a green space made up of various temporary rest and relaxation facilities, such as picnic tables, a book box, a platform, armchairs, in order to transform the Hector-Prud mineral square. man in a public place where to rest, meet and exchange. The activities held during the summer season are numerous and varied: meditation, concerts, storytelling, dance workshops, creative workshops, children&#39;s games, drawing, cinema, etc. [ix] thanks to numerous partnerships.Organizational structure, membership and fundingOrganizational structureThe organizational structure of Oasis Bellechasse resumes in a certain way the co-creation process initiated by the “Our living environments” project. Thus, the collective in charge of the management of the public square is made up of ten members, including seven residents of the district, accompanied by a member of the Rosemont-La-Petite-Patrie borough and two members of the facilitating organizations Solon and the Center for the study of social responsibility and eco-citizenship [x].The structure is based on the holding of monthly “collective Wednesdays”, which bring together citizens interested in the project to reflect on the neighborhood in transition and the solutions to be provided. Citizens are invited to participate in many ways: through online surveys soliciting programming ideas, by holding monthly meetings and by participating in co-creative workshops to build, maintain and green the spatial arrangements. . The collective&#39;s Facebook page allows citizens to communicate and engage with the project. It is followed by more than 500 subscribers [xi].Funding, donations and servicesThe co-creation process resulting from the “Our living environments” project was made possible thanks to a grant from the Action-Climat Québec program, from the Québec Action Fund for Sustainable Development [xii]. To ensure the completion of the project selected for Place Hector Prud&#39;homme, funding of $ 10,000 from the Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie borough was obtained in 2018. It was used to animate the site for the summer period. and the purchase of building materials [xiii]. This funding was supplemented by the allocation in 2018 of a scholarship of $ 3,000 by participants in the participatory budget &quot;Round trip&quot; organized by the provincial deputy of the sector, Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois, for the distribution of his discretionary budget. . This funding is renewed in 2019 [xiv] for the development and animation of the space.Finally, the Oasis Bellechasse is part of a commercial sector, at the entrance to Plaza Saint-Hubert and also benefits from donations and services from local merchants. The neighboring business The mirrored cabinet thus lends picnic tables to the Oasis Bellechasse, since the development of rest areas within the sector encourages its customers in return [xv].Specializations, methods and toolsAn experimentation process initiated by a network of institutional actorsThe “Our living environments” project is based on a theoretical approach to transition and an experimentation process. Through experimentation, the project stakeholders put forward a concrete learning process for change and ecological transitionin a context of uncertainty which characterizes global problems. This learning-by-doing takes up the theoretical base of the transitions approach, that is to say “implementing reflexive governance systems which consist in generating and integrating networks of actors and of innovation which reinforce each other through their actions, experiments, projects and practices ”[xvi]. Thus, in the case of the “Our living environments” project, the steering committee is made up of the association of two community organizations, Solon and Coop Carbone, and a research organization, the UQAM Research Chair on ecological transition. In addition, the project governance committee integrates a network of community and innovation organizations, such as the Social Economy Worksite, Innovative Territories in Social and Solidarity Economy (TIESS), the Center d &#39; study in social responsibility and eco-citizenship (CERSÉ), the Rosemont Environmental Development Company (SODER), L&#39;Esplanade, Fondaction and CIRODD. These multiple actors help to diversify the expertise in order to be able to measure and report on the impacts of the project since &quot;Our living environments&quot; emerges from a questioning of community actors on the potential of existing green lane projects to contribute to the transition. ecological. It is therefore important to mobilize many actors to measure and evaluate the effects of the projects deployed. The Oasis Bellechasse is therefore not the result of a citizens&#39; initiative as such. Rather, the project stems from a questioning of actors from community and innovation circles who will in return mobilize and support the emergence of local citizen initiatives.The project therefore aims to &quot;put in place a structured and reflective process through which local partners, citizens and a group of researchers identify the needs and issues of sustainability and undertake to develop pilot projects making it possible to act and learn about the transition ”[xvii]. To do this, an iterative approach is implemented, following these different steps:Creation of a steering committee, assessment and identification of living environmentsMobilization of living environments and development of desirable visions of the futureIdentification of a diagnosisFormulation of motivationsDefinition of projects to be undertakenDefinition of a vision for the futureSelection of projects and implementationTransferThe project, if it enabled the realization of the Oasis Bellechasse, nevertheless shows a certain gap between the expectations of the citizens involved and of the steering committee from the community. The temporalities are different. On the one hand, citizens&#39; time is voluntary and therefore counted. He is punctual, punctuated by evenings and weekends. We must therefore maximize it and prevent the involvement of citizens from appearing in vain over time. On the other hand, the duration of the project is marked by identified phases, by the intensity of citizen involvement and by impacts linked to the requirements of donors [xviii]. The project therefore develops at a distance from concrete citizens&#39; initiatives emerging directly from citizens.Scope of the projectThe “Our living environments” project ends with a transfer phase. The Oasis Bellechasse therefore resembles a pilot project, destined to be reproduced in other areas of the borough. The success of Oasis Bellechasse has thus enabled the creation of a funding program for the Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie borough. In February 2019, the latter implemented “Citizen participatory projects” which offers residents the opportunity to take charge of the greening and animation of vacant spaces or public places thanks to the granting of a grant of $ 10,000 per project and through support from the Montreal Urban Ecology Center and Solon [xix]. The project is therefore intended to be replicated in 25 sectors of the borough. Building on the learning at the end of the ideation phase of the Oasis Bellechasse, the “Citizen participatory projects” require an emerging mobilization of citizens themselves and not of community actors.Major projects and eventsInitiatives carried outIdeation and arrangement: collective Wednesdays, co-creation workshop, arrangement, plantations, construction of furniture, maintenanceFestive events and cultural activities: concerts, exhibitions, inauguration, back-to-school party, cinema, storytelling, collaborative games,  family activities, meditation,Workshops and courses: introduction to permaculture, drawing, making solar lights, making notebooks, dancing, sculpture, introduction to town planningSupported initiatives100 in 1 day: international day of citizen collaborationPublicationsCities, “The urban commons.

Through this activity, a group of young people receive training in social rights and then go to secondary schools to work with schoolchildren on values such as tolerance, non-discrimination and equality. Provide formal and non-formal education centers with tools for the promotion and education of social rights, gender equity and environmental sustainability.  It proposes a methodology in minors and adolescents, between 6 and 18 years old. The objectives are framed in groups of children from 6 to 18 years in the educational system, as future agents of social change.  Educational professionals and monitors, as reference figures in the socialization process and important agents when it comes to transmitting concepts and training.Origins and Development  Da2 Trucados Association was born as a response to a willing concern to share and disseminate as a form of alternative leisure, with the joint effort of a group of fans, board games. With the intention of promoting this modality of leisure among the citizens of the Costa Tropical, created this community with the desire to attract another large number of fans, and to instill the values that are present in this type of activities. Initially among our objectives is to promote the Board Games as a means to develop positive attitudes such as teamwork, imagination, creativity, in addition to promoting them as a leisure alternative, promoting a youthful and adult leisure activity, healthy and responsible.Although the association was created at the beginning of 2014, most of the people who are part of ""Da2 Trucados"" have a good curriculum of game moments and we have had the experience of being able to enjoy them with many friends throughout life, and to share these recreational activities with other groups of people.Main Projects and Events  During these years since the association was constituted, we have carried out lucid activities and acts in the town in collaboration with the area of youth and culture of the City of Almuñécar. During these years we participated in the ""Fair of Associations"" organized by the Social Welfare Area of the City of Almuñécar, obtaining as a result a great participation, in addition to being a great showcase to make ourselves known, we left there very happy to receive a special recognition for our involvement in bringing board games, and the attitudes they bring,to youth.It has also collaborated in the campaign ""Almuñécar Ciudad Sana"", an event organized by the Youth and Social Welfare Council of the city of Almuñécar, to bring other leisure models to youth away from the consumption of alcohol and other drugs. The Association, during the Fridays of the months of July and August, has mounted workshops and organized various activities to show and teach the young people of the town another way to have fun and enjoy their leisure time in a cooperative and healthy way.  In addition to these local activities, it has collaborated in others of a regional nature, as well as the collaboration of other national associations. Da2 Trucados participates in the European projects  Eramus + Demogames  and  PeaceGamesHubConnect with young people by getting them to appropriate personal and social values through socio-playful activities.

[1]  Origins and Development  Founder Rand Strauss stumbled on this in 2011, beginning with the belief that accountability is necessary, missing, and was never designed into democracies.[2]According to Strauss,""[b]ecause it was absent, political parties formed and then money was needed to win elections. The American political system was designed to handle neither of these. They've burdened other democracies as well - choosing a party allows a person to choose a coarse position on all issues instead of expressing choice on each issue.""  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Currently PeopleCount is the sole founder's part-time project. It's also a California B-corp (for the benefit of society), but there are no employees or assets, so it's easily changed. There's no funding.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  It's been said that anything is possible when adults communicate. However, political communication often appears to be primitive, ineffective and much of it is childish (divisive). Political communication must occur between everyone, so everyone can govern  together . Yet human communication systems are 1 &lt;--&gt; 1, 1-&gt;many, few &lt;--&gt; few, or few-&gt;many. Voting is the only many&lt;--&gt;many communication system, and it's seldom used. PeopleCount specializes in a system designed for efficient 1&lt;--&gt;many and many&lt;--&gt;many communication.  Major Projects and Events  Oct 2020: The founder is building a web app, slowly. To be kept informed, people can  join a mailing list .  Analysis and Lessons Learned1. Discovered about ""accountability"" :Accountability is required for democracy to reliably work [3]  Few people have a clear, rigorous definition of accountability [4]  Very little accountability occurs during elections. [ citation needed ]Thus accountability appears to be lacking and perceived as lacking by many Americans [5] so fixing this is necessary. Cultural myths, such as ""the media provides accountability"" arise as a challenge, insofar as they are misleading and act to prevent actions which could promote accountability from being taken.  Finally, a rigorous functional definition shows how an internet-based communication system could restore political accountability, rejuvenating democracy and empowering citizens to govern themselves effectively.In Toni G.L.A. van der Meer, Dave Gelders and Sabine Rotthier's exploratory study on e-Democracy, they conclude that ""governments predominantly utilize the Web to disseminate information. They seem to lack responsiveness, openness, and interactivity, indicating one-way communication or simple interaction despite the Web-based opportunities to facilitate active two-way communication. Sincedialogueis characterized as two-way communication beyond simple interaction, one may conclude that governments do not utilize e-Government to its fullest potential in terms of facilitating and utilizing all dialogue possibilities.""[6]2. People often find it difficult to understand anything newOur cultural myths about politics are many and strong. If a solution doesn't fit into the status quo, it is often difficult for people to understand or accept it. Instead, they may substitute similar ideas they already know, or dismiss it all when it doesn't add up.3. People often believe they can understand something new in a few minutes.PeopleCount's founder has suggested that,""if an idea can't be understood in a few minutes, it has a lesser chance of being adopted, funded, supported. Western culture holds that it's ludicrous to not have a compelling elevator pitch. This is especially true of professional investors and academics who assume their notion of being ""smart"" means they'll quickly understand a new paradigm. People believe it's others' responsibility to be convincing and inspiring, not their own responsibility to understand.""

More on their boards, committees, and advisory bodies can be found on theirwebsite  .Specializations, Methods and ToolsNERC supports “strategic and applied research, survey and long-term environmental observation and monitoring of the whole Earth system,” from the deep Earth and oceans to the atmosphere and space.[4] NERC also provides third-party advice on scientific issues, and evidence for parliament and select committees.[5]Working in partnership with the environmental science community, government, policymakers, public bodies and the general public on how to deliver the science is central to their strategy.[5] For example, NERC held apublic dialogue on geoengineering in 2010  , to help inform policy on supporting geoengineering research. To move beyond communication, NERC aims to meaningfully engage the public to enable informed, evidence-based decisions on the impact of research which will be most relevant for society.[6]Major Projects and EventsA focus of NERC’s public engagement strategy is to use public dialogue to inform NERC. For instance, the “2019 Digital Environment Public Dialogue sought to listen to what diverse groups of people, as stakeholders in research, thought about NERC’s newdigital environment research theme  , led by specialistsHopkins Van Mil  .”[6]Previous public dialogue projects, co-funded bySciencewise  , include:Global food security public panel (2015)UK National Ecosystem Assessment(2015)Space weather dialogue(2013)Public engagement with shale gas and oil(2013)Water Quality and Sustainability(2012)Planet Under Pressure Conference – Youth Voice(2012)Citizens Advisory Forum for Living with Environmental Change(2011)Geoengineering(2010)Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

Walter Thompson, which recognized “the benefits of increasing its market knowledge by talking to their customers directly.”[1] After World War II, their priorities shifted from commercial patterns to social problems of the time period, such as rationing, workforce depletion, and wartime communications.[1]Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingTNS-BMRB is part of the Kantar Public network, which provides insights and actionable recommendations to clients, worldwide, based on data and evidence.[2] Led by acting CEO, Ben Toombs, the organization’s senior staff are “acknowledged leaders in the social research sector.”  [3]Specializations, Methods and ToolsAs a public policy research company, TNS-BMRB has conducted large-scale socialsurveysandfocus groupson various topics including work and employment; education; and children and family policy; they work on behalf of government departments, local authorities, and charities.[4] They aim to provide responsive policy evaluation exploring: “policy implementation (formative evaluation); how policy is delivered (process evaluation); what difference the policy makes (impact assessment); and how far the benefits justify the costs (economic analysis).”[5]To this organization, qualitative research is seen as valuable to “evaluate where improvements and efficiencies can be made across public services” by helping government understand the views and priorities of the British public.[5] Therefore, they use in-depth interviews, focus groups, ethnography, deliberation,onlineandvisualmethods, and peer-led research. Kantar Public also aims to “specialize in research with ‘hard to reach’ groups including those on low incomes, the learning disabled, those with mental health issues, black and minority ethnic communities, and children and young people.”[5]Major Projects and EventsTNS-BMRB (now Kantar Public UK) has worked with “prestigious scientific organisations in areas including public engagement, communications, policy development, evaluation, and improving regulation.”[6] One such programme was withSciencewiseand the research councils involved in delivering public dialogue studies on:global food securityandopen data(RCUK),synthetic biology  ,stem cellsand nanotechnology (BBSRC, EPSRC), and geo-engineering for climate change (Royal Society).Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

Origins and Development  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Specializations, Methods and Tools  One of the main challenges within the network has been the possibility of having face-to-face meetings, due to the great extension of Argentina's geography. Its work strategies have been based on the use of information and communication technologies , sharing work material online, and implementing virtual sessions. After each meeting, members socialize agreements with their grassroots community or organization.  Major Projects and Events  The National Population and Housing Census 2020 is a process of great importance for indigenous peoples, since its results are the baseline for the formulation of public policies that could benefit indigenous territories in the decade 2020-2030. For the Weaving of Indigenous Professionals, the correct quantification of the population is a prerequisite for the exercise of autonomy in indigenous territories, since the population criterion is the basis for guarantees regarding their own education, health, and medicine, as well as for alternative production models and access to natural resources. In this sense, the adequate identification of the population in each of the indigenous territories is the basis for the exercise of territorial and linguistic rights.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Only members who have been able to pay for their trips to Buenos Aires have been able to attend the consultation meetings with the authorities of the National Institute of Statistics and Census. The National Census of Population and Housing 2020 is a very important process for indigenous peoples, as its results are the baseline for the formulation of public policies that could benefit indigenous territories in the decade 2020-2030.

Hate crimes are committed by perpetrators with the sole intention of targeting victims who belong to a particular social group and discriminating against them on grounds of for example, sexual orientation, expression and gender identity.  Origins and Development  In 2010, Argentina was the first Latin American country to recognize same-sex marriage. Two years later, in 2012, Bill No. 26.791 modified the Criminal Code to punish with life in prison hate crimes motivated by sexual orientation and gender identity. In this context, the Observatory was created by the Anti-Discrimination Institute of the Ombudsman's Office of the City of Buenos Aires, the Argentine LGBT Federation, and the National Ombudsman's Office.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Created by the Anti-Discrimination Institute of the Ombudsman's Office of the City of Buenos Aires, the Argentine LGBT Federation, and the National Ombudsman's Office, the Observatory seeks to monitor violence against the LGBT community and influence the formulation of legislation and public policy regarding the prevention, punishment and eradication of hate crimes against the LGBT community. In its2019 report, the Observatorio Nacional made some urgent recommendationsfor the State which included: integral reform of the Law Against Discrimination; training to the national security forces on topics of human rights, sexual diversity, and non-discrimination; as well as the adoption of nationwide educational campaigns for the LGBT community about their rights and access to public services.

Secondly, it empowers students, allowing them to voice their preferences and to become equal and proactive actors of the educational systems, and to assume responsibility for shaping a dynamic, highly performing, modern and grassroots approach to pedagogic planning, development and implementation.  Lastly, the Council of Students serves as a watchdog against abuse in the educational system, seeking to reinforce compliance with official norms, acting as observers or even mediators at certain times.  As a hybrid system of democratic participation, the Council of Students can be regarded as a complex institution. On one hand, it can be seen as an empowering activist movement, which fosters engagement and action-taking through various platforms of public  deliberation  and consultation. On the other, it is a well-integrated structure, operating alongside the major educational entities of the state apparatus, as a mechanism for bridging the gap between students and decision-makers, spearheading alternative or innovative processes, and overall supporting the advancement of the Romanian educational system.  This grassroots-oriented form of free association, at the pre-university level, became the most notable officially-recognized institution (of the Romanian educational system) which acts, in an unmoderated way, in the best interest of the students, through direct representation and participation across an independent, apolitical and non-religious, network of hierarchically interlinked units. Its primary focus is to ensure the existence of a framework in which students can meaningfully voice their preferences, opinions or ideas, and to generate opportunities for direct contributions towards the construction of a diverse, inclusive, modern and performant educational system, based on the organization’s adherence to universal democratic values and freedoms. The structure, via its fundamental objectives and core missions, seeks to remediate some of the major challenges that have eroded the quality of the educational act in post-communist Romania. As such, the main pillars, which form the Council of Students’ organizational goals, while subsequently addressing specific problems, are:Representing the students, as the principal beneficiaries of the educational processes, and ensuring that relevant administrative and legislative bodies are acting in accordance with their legitimate interests.  Advocating for (and ensuring) the active participation and involvement of students, as equal stakeholders, in decision-making procedures that might affect them.  Monitoring the correct implementation, application, and interpretation of policies related to students’ rights and obligations, while setting measures in place in order to prevent or mediate abuses and conflictual stances.  Facilitating and fostering knowledge exchanges (e.g. know-how, ideas, win-win situations, good practices, etc.), as a way of enabling and further implementation of innovatory and positive development.  Ensuring sub and intra-structural growth (alongside their networks of partners), increasing their capacity for autonomous action-taking and the delivery of positive outcomes in the community. [1]  [2]Origins and Development  The Council of Students, even though it’s a very particular structure, modeled by the specificity of the Romanian society, finds its origins in an international context. In 1975, the city of Dublin saw the creation of OBESSU (The Organizing Bureau of European School Student Unions). This newly founded trans-national representative body reunited a wide array of student unions across the continent (active in general secondary and secondary vocational education) as Member, Candidate or Affiliate Organisations disseminating their practices, ideas, and desires. [3 ] It is exactly this international promotion of multi-organizational forms of democratic innovation and participatory spaces in the educational sector, coupled with the broader (geo)political context of the era, which inspired, and ultimately led to the creation of the (Romanian) Council of Students.  The Romanian students, inspired by the actions of their European peers and having gained new rights and freedoms, shortly after the Romanian Revolution and amidst the democratic transition of the country, started, in 1991, forming various councils in schools across the country. In spite of this fact, it is only close to the beginning of the new millennium that this ""avant-gardist” and western-driven wave of democratic expression, transcended towards a self-statutory organisation.  [4]Consequently, in 1999 the first County Council of Students ( Consiliul Județean al Elevilor – CJE )  was founded, at the students’ request, in Dâmbovița by a group of teachers; 3 years later, the first independent one (entirely managed by students) formed in the city of Cluj-Napoca, with many to follow their example.  [5]Due to an exponential increase in the number of student-led associations, the National Council of Students ( Consiliul Național al Elevilor – CNE)  was formed in 2006 (as a way to unite the emerging movement), integrating 18 out of the 41 existing Counties. In the same year, the first General Assembly took place in the town of Călimănești (24-25th of March), with the participation of two students and one Inspector for Didactic Activities per County; the sessions were moderated by the State Secretary for Pre-University Education Paloma Petrescu.  [6]Following the success of the first General Assembly, the first document regulating the organization and functioning of the Council of Students was approved. Throughout its articles, the administrative order formally acknowledged the structure and regulated its ways of operating, while also putting it under the direct authority of the Ministry of Education, Research and Youth as a ""consultative structure”. [ 7]As a result, the following period (2006-2009) the candidates for the NCS were selected by a commission of School Inspectors, and all their decisions required  a priori  approval by the ministerial cabinet. This situation drastically changed in 2010 with the approval of a new document that enabled:the creation of a CCS in every County, whose development would be facilitated through 8 Regional Council of Students (discontinued after 2015); the creation in every school of a SCS; greater funding allocation and legal jurisdiction; and most importantly, the recognition of its autonomous and independent character.  From there on, with every generation that passed, alongside numerous legislative and administrative orders, aimed at increasing its capacity, autonomy and self-reliance, the structure was fine-tuned and slowly increased its reach, scope and means, evolving into what it is today.[ 8 ]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  A large proportion of the main activities (representation and consultation, through General Assemblies, international forum participation, public discussions, etc.) undertaken by the Council of Students have always been under the auspice of the Ministry of Education and its substructures; funding and support based on unconditional terms, as specified by the law. [9]  [10]  [11 ][ 12 ][ 13 ][ 14] [ 15] [ 16 ]  In recent times, the Council of Students has gained its judicial status, becoming an entity in its own right, meaning that it can generate partnerships, sign contracts of sponsorship, manage funds, or even receive donations (while retaining its non-profit and voluntary character). Analysing all of the secondary activities undertaken by the Council and its substructures (as to observe the range of public and private entities involved into co-organizing, supporting or funding these initiatives) would be impossible. Yet there are a few official partners that have endorsed, for a long time, the activities carried out at the national level, among whom are: UNICEF Romania, OBESSU, Youth Council of Romania, Makosz, Forum Apolum, FITT, The Council for Institutionalized Youths, ANOSR. [ 17]Primary LocationThe Council of Students, at the moment, presents no permanent headquarters or offices from where it conducts its daily operations. Instead, it is decentralized in terms of physical spaces with national General Assemblies (both extraordinary and ordinary ones) across the counties, in an attempt to spread out its reach and on-sight interactions with regional or local actors. In this light, it can be said that the National Council of Students operates inside the official borders of Romania (with very selective and limited external interactions), alongside its county and school substructures. The latter are likely to host their General Assemblies in various venues, available at their respective county seat (42 in total, which are also known as County Capital Municipality/City), across more than 1200 educational institutions across the country (or even at the headquarters of local, regional, and national administrative or legislative bodies).Scope of InfluenceThe geographical scope of the Council of Students varies accordingly to the level of the organization that is used as a measurement, and it presents itself as follows: National and sometimes Regional or International (National Council of Students); Regional and City (County Council of Students); Metropolitan Area (Bucharest Municipal Council of Students); Organization (School Council of Students). While the geographical scope presents fluctuations, the jurisdictional scope remains limited to the Romanian legal structures (including the ones that are shaped in accordance to its adherence to international norms), more precisely the ones which are directly linked or impact the educational system.Legality   The Council of Students, and all of its subsidiaries, operates within clearly defined legal boundaries. Thus, all of their actions and processes are considered to be in line with the legal frameworks that are in place. Even the internal measures, terms and provisions are legally binding in the face of judicial authorities (as long as they do not breach parts of the common law). Also, the members and the structures constitute legal entities with attributes, responsibilities, and rights set in place through various normative acts.StructureThe most basic constituent part is the School Council of Students (mandatory in every educational institution) which consists of a General Assembly and an Executive Office. The former is constituted by internally nominated representatives from all High School and Gymnasium level classes. Its primary function is to act as a decisional forum (which sits as often as necessary), overseeing the implementation of different changes, reaching agreement on different issues and gathering feedback, all through public gatherings, debate and voting mechanisms. The Executive Office, consisting of a President, Vice President(s) and Secretary – that are directly elected from the students, through an election system in one or two turns, based upon the majoritarian vote of all the students of that particular educational institution – manages the activities of the Assembly, moderates sessions, sets the agenda, sets forward proposals, ensure the compliance with internal and national policies, act as spokespersons, initiate extra-organizational cooperation, etc.  [18]All the Presidents (unless their duties have been formally handed over to one of the Vice Presidents) of the School Councils of Students are members of the General Assembly for the County Council of Students, based on their real life territorial-administrative distribution. Their activity is in turn directed by an Executive Office, which is elected through direct majoritarian or preferential vote of the General Assembly, which presents some particularities of its own.All the members of the school Executive Offices can present their candidature for positions in the county Executive Office, after they have been delegated by their own General Assembly. In addition to the President, Vice President(s) and Secretary positions the Executive Offices of the counties have 5 different departments each under the authority of a Director (position open to all students of that county), and have the possibility to create new structures as necessary (e.g. Press Bureau, Assistants etc.). A notable exception is the Bucharest Municipality Council of Students which has Vice-Presidents for each district of the city.  In addition to the General Assembly and Executive Office, the National Council of Students includes two more structures: the National Ethics Commission and Press Bureau. Firstly, the General Assembly represents the decisional core and is constituted from all county Presidents, and 3 Vice-Presidents of the Bucharest Municipality Council of Students. Their activity is coordinated by an Executive Office, which includes a President, 8 Vice-Presidents, Executive Secretary for the Department of Internal Affairs and Executive Secretary for the Department of Education and Communication, all elected, by majoritarian or preferential vote of the National General Assembly, from the ranks of the County Presidents.  The National Ethics Commission is formed by 3 members, directly elected by the National General Assembly, and is open to all the members of the organization regarding their level and alumni. Lastly, more of an auxiliary organism, the Press Bureau, is a structure which undertakes assistance tasks, and, although they can actively participate, they do not possess voting rights in the General Assemblies.They directly respond to the Executive Secretary for the Department of Education and Communication and its members are preselected by the former, on a free-for-all students’ voluntary application basis, and then approved, through majoritarian vote on individual grounds, by the National General Assembly. [ 20 ][ 21 ]FacilitatorsIn its early stages of existence, the Council of Students relied heavily on external facilitators, mentors, and trainers to prepare/guide each generation, set mechanisms in place, and ensure that processes of interaction properly occur. They were usually randomly or voluntarily selected from specially designated academic members (e.g. teachers, school inspectorate, ministry staff, etc.). As time passed, they were replaced by other NGOs' members and an internal alumni network that undertook the task of facilitating, moderating, and mentoring the newcomers. In recent times, this has moved on to on-the-go knowledge, hierarchical facilitation, internally-driven crowd teaching, national guidelines and other forms of intra-organizational preparations; external (non-governmental only) actors being requested only for specific facilitation (e.g. coding, development of new voting patterns, opinion polling, and conducting research etc.).Members and ParticipantsIn terms of the entire population, the Council of Students presents itself as a structure that is limited to students enrolled in primary and secondary education (as they form the core group of the organizations’ activities) – but inside this group, the structure is open to all since it allows the right of participation and involvement in its processes to everyone.  The recruitment of members is done either via elections (which entail different rights of participation and duties) or voluntary involvement (various auxiliary functions); also the right to take part in activities (as an observer) is granted to everyone else and sometimes special requests for involvement are made towards experts, decision-makers, NGO leaders, alumni, etc. The opportunity to take part in elections and their methodology is widely communicated every year across the country through  social media , Ministry of Education, and mass-media; while in terms of secondary activities, in general, they tend to be open to the entire community (e.g. charity works, fundraising,  petitions , arts and crafts etc.).  All of the expenses encountered during the formal activities of the Council of Students are covered (excluding direct payment), while some efforts have been dedicated to enable easier participation of members with rural, disability, economically difficult or ethnic backgrounds (e.g. direct promotion of the structure, suitable changes in the nature of activities, higher expenses covered).  In terms of representativity, being the highest forums of consultation and representation in the education sector (excluding systems of higher education) its participants have been all of the (roughly) 3 million students that are actively enrolled at any given time. The active members would be as follows: 45 at the national level (executive board) with the addition of representatives from all counties at the General Assemblies (in general 2 per county); 10-15 (board) at the county level with as many members as schools represented; and 5-10 members (board) at school level with as many class representatives as necessary. The exact numbers widely differ, but by adding up it would amount to roughly 13,000 members across the country at all levels.All of its members, including the administration staff (e.g. Press Bureau, Executive Office of the National Council, facilitators, trainers, etc.), are students or at least youth (with the small exception of when external stakeholders are involved in those particular activities — NGOs, experts, freelancers, companies etc.), and their work is completely unpaid, the exception being costs related to travels and other small incidentals.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Even though the Council of Students uses a wide array of tools and methods, in order to achieve its goals, they are closely tied to the structural arrangements and revolve around the primary goal: representation. Thus, by looking at how the council approaches the representation of students across the country, one can understand some of the main processes, interactions and methods that are used. This is especially so since the structure is one in which internal interactions are formed through well-defined hierarchical patterns which are centralized around the NCS (both amongst members and organizations), while external action-taking can be regarded as more of a bottom-up approach inside the educational sector  per se .  The executives' main activities are to close the feedback loops by pushing information downwards, monitor activities in schools, offer guidance, interlink organizations, approve activity reports, demote or apply punitive measures for non-compliance, mediate conflicts, realize  petitions , initiate community-wide projects, organize forms of  protest ; this is done using debate, public hearings, interactions with other stakeholders,  focus groups , brainstorming events,  consensus  or majoritarian voting, bargaining with decision-makers, etc.  [19]At the top of the structure, sits the National Council of Students, which unites all of the structures, coordinates their general activities, sets agendas, proposes nation-wide policies, creates or implements internal regulatory changes, acts on the international stage or in relations with governmental bodies, engages with the wider public and private entities, signs inter-organizational cooperation contracts, attracts sponsors, and more.  Ensuring that the G.A. and E.O. activities are conducted in accordance with the existing judicial framework, and signalling any abuses, is the main task of the National Ethics Commission (alongside mediating conflicts, validating documents, or proposing sanctions etc.).ApproachThe Council of Students possesses a wide array of tools that can be used in order to achieve its primary and secondary objectives, the main approach being a peer-to-peer co-governance and voluntary co-production, alongside the Ministry of Education (its subsidiaries and all other structures that have shared competences in this matter). Secondly, by employing internal consultations and direct decision-making, driven by leadership development of students, they are able to approach the state apparatus through the use of various advocacy-driven methods. Lastly, the structure itself fosters the apparition of creative independent actions, limited forms of protests (especially digitally-oriented), evaluation, oversight and  social auditing  in the educational sector or informal engagement with NGOs for co-option in activities. This is due to the fact that the structure is divagating its power as much as possible and all of its structural subdivisions (or even individual members) retain certain degrees of autonomy in terms of engaging in various forms of citizenship or civil society building on its behalf, as they see fit.  Major Projects and Events  In time, across all of its levels, the Council of Students has had numerous achievements ranging from policy changes, budget increases, and gaining rights, all the way to community-driven initiatives, network building, or even influencing positive shifts in the general public's mentality [22] [ 23 ][ 24 ]. It has hosted more than 30 National General Assemblies and thousands of County ones.  In terms of  policy-making , the Council has:created, lobbied, and passed the Students’ Status (ratified through the Order 4742/2016 and published in the Official Gazette, part I, on the 23rd of August 2016) which grants several rights including the students’ voting right in administrative councils[ 25 ][ 26 ]  helped the passing of the Law 38/2019 [ 27]  (and many others) which amends and improves the Law for National Education 1/2011[ 28 ], in regards to student bursaries and other financing, demanded through an open letter for the Government signed by more than 36,000 people [29 ];  initiated the Youths' Resolution in 2016 alongside more than 20 other organisations [30 ];  actively rejected (lately was taken down) the Government Emergency Order 51/2019 [31]Protestand AwarenessIn 2018, the Council started a campaign for the improvement of curriculum, signed by more than 150,000 people. In 2019, it started the movement #emptysheets (offering an empty subject sheet as a sign of personal protest during the national simulations for the baccalaureate and 8th grade exams) which gained national attention[ 32 ]. The Council also organized ""Mourning for Education” a protest aimed at the celebrations for the commencement of the new educational year [33 ]Also in 2018, it presented the RISEN report regarding the real-world situation of school transportation in Romania. [ 34 ]Projects :  The Council organized a national forming session in Cluj-Napoca (2018) which reunited more than 100 newly elected student representatives; realized the Students’ Illustrated Guide (2019), which promotes students’ rights and obligations,and started a promoting caravan in all the major cities of the country; [ 35 ] hosted the National Student Gala [36 ]; sustained the development of the Volunteering Law 78/2014[ 37] ; became a full member into OBESSU [38]  and inspired the creation of a Council of Students in the Republic of Moldova (2013)[ 39 ]; and participated at the European Youth Seminar and EU Youth Conference in Brussels (2019). [40]Analysis and Lessons Learned  The council of Students represents a peculiar hybrid structure and there are some lessons, good practices, and examples that can be learned from it. Being similar to the formats used in  National Public Policy Conferences  (especially the Brazilian one) [41]  and student senates (the  ASUW  one) [42] , the literature surrounding that area also applies to the Council of Students and can be extrapolated (e.g. the works of scholars such as Pogrebinschi, McCabe, Walden or Camden). Similar to them, the Councils' participants are elected; after, their candidacy is approved, with their term duration, responsibilities, and rights varying according to the role they take. Sometimes the election processes represent a challenge as there is a general tendency either for the same person to maintain their position year-after-year due to the fact that they might register high satisfaction rates, already have ensured the support of the majority, present themselves with better experiences compared to newcomers, or there is simply no one else to step up. There has also been the case for high fluidity in terms of position occupancy, this in turn presenting quite a challenge, especially when the Executive Offices are vacated mid-term as it is hard to arrange an effective election and campaigns in the middle of the school year. In general, the duration of the mandate makes candidates and those who occupy positions of leadership in the end think in the short term with respect to revenue; this issue is largely controlled by the National Council of Students, which imposes sets of values, projects, and endeavours to its substructures—which are cross-generational, repetitive, easy to replicate and in general long-term, in order for the activities to have continuity and a high impact rate (e.g. lobbying for an increase in educational budgeting to 6% of the GDP which has been continuously pursued for more than 10 years).  The organization redefines and deploys participatory tools similar to the ones used in mini-publics,  citizens’ summit /panel/ assembly  and public  budgeting ; emphasizing freedom of expression,  deliberation , idea generation, agreement reaching, inclusion, etc. It differs due to its repetitive, formal, and governmentally-linked character. While this is true, the Council ofStudents often uses tools such as  petitions ,  Q&amp;A , or public panels with governmental representatives,  focus-groups , pooling and  online voting , protests, policy-proposals and lobbying or bargaining,  workshops , and more.  It is easy to say from these that it is a traditional form of democratic participation, but the interesting factor lies in the capacity of the organization to strike a balance between formal integration and recognition in the state apparatus and truly voicing and representing its targeted audience. This took the form of a semi-symbiotic relationship with the administrative and legislative agencies. On one hand, the Councils’ legal framework, funding and creation was done by a governmental body, under the pressure of the students demanding freedom of expressions, but on the other it was designed in such a way that the law itself guarded the organization from intervention, co-option or forms of coercion by clearly specifying and regulating institutional interactions. This in turn has led to an organic development of its capacities (similar to other NGOs), alongside its primary consultation and representation functions, whichhelped the structure to become both a relevant partner and actor in the educational sector but also a self-centered organization which is constructing its own pathways to achieve long-term community development both internally and externally.  One of the first challenges faced by the organization was that of striking a balance between formal authorities and integration into the state apparatus and true representativity. This took the form of a semi-symbiotic relationship in which the legal framework and creation was generated by a governmental body, while also funding most of the activity, but it specifically guaranteed it from forms of intervention, co-option, coercion and many others in order to allow for autonomy and capacity of acting and representing while also serving as a platform of consultancy. The main strength which emerges from this initial approach is the fact that the expansion of the structure, its development and its influence have exponentially grown from its apparition (e.g. being mandatory by law for every school to create one led to a sudden burst of them; having meetings with the Minister of Education from the beginning made the structure increase its power of representation quite quickly and allowed it to interact with the state apparatus from the start). The weakness of this design, in terms of democratic processes, is seen during the first years of existence and is represented through mainly a struggle to gain independence, become truly apolitical, avoid interference from governmental bodies.  The closeness with the formal entities can simply be seen as an attempt to copy European developments, by creating a structure which was subordinated to the Ministry of Education almost entirely; it gained through an initial governmental pull-over of resources, significance, influence, reach, know-how, and relevance, the status of partner and consultation forum, only to become more self-reliant over time and completely independent in its actions nowadays (with only funding being gained through it).Spectrum of Public ParticipationIf one were to place the Council of Students inside the IAP2 Spectrum of Public Participation, one could observe that its contributions and interactions fit between the larger descriptions of the Collaborate/Involve categories. This dualistic indexation is primarily due to the fact that the variations occur based on two ever-changing aspects: on one hand, the organizational level that is analysed (e.g. school structures are more likely to collaborate and share power with administrative councils or directors, while county ones might just get involved in the City Hall's decisions), and on the other hand, the nature of the participation act (e.g. due to the wide array of activities, the Ministry or Governmental Agencies might be keen to collaborate towards the development of new assignment methods, but just involve participants on the matter of curriculum or even simply inform of the scheduling of break periods). In this case, it is safe to say that the Council of Students’ public participation, more often than not, revolves around these two broad categories, while acknowledging that itpresents variations which can be, based on their specificity, pinned down almost everywhere on the spectrum.

[Their] unique matching algorithm makes it easy for media, nonprofits and governments to fight polarisation, arguably one of the most important issues facing society today. [They] help break people out of their filter bubbles, build empathy, and work to define common values that strengthen democracy - all with just a conversation” [1].  The goal is to set up a platform where strangers with opposing political views can have one-on-one discussions on common issues [1]. In an age of political polarization and divisiveness, My Country Talks aims to “spark conversations around the world” [2].  Origins and Development  Founded in 2017 by Zeit ONLINE - online edition of the weekly German paper Die Zeit - my Country Talks is a platform and project composed of various series and events.  The political climate at the time of its foundation was characterized by polarization with the election of Donald Trump as president in the USA, the state of Brexit in Britain [3] and the lead up to the German Federal Elections. Therefore, the newsroom proposed the following question: “In times of filter bubbles and polarized discourse, how can we restart the conversation across political divides?” [2]  On May 4, 2017, Zeit ONLINE published a widget on the homepage of its website asking the following question: “May we introduce you to someone?” To outline their political views, the participants answered a brief survey of the following yes-or-no questions:“Has Germany accepted too many refugees?  Should Germany abandon the euro and return to the ""Deutsche Mark""?  Is the West treating Russia fairly?  Was abandoning nuclear energy the right move?  Should homosexual couples be allowed to marry?” [3]Participants were also asked to share their postal codes.  During summer 2017, 12,000 people had registered. As a result, people were paired to meet with strangers that:live within 20 kms of each other  have different political views [4]On June 18, 2017, the first event took place: ""Germany Talks"" or  Deustchland Spricht . In the first edition, 1,200 people across Germany met up in pairs for personal, face-to-face, hour-long political discussions to find common ground between seemingly opposite political views. The event was followed by “100’s of euphoric emails from participants who were thrilled by the opportunity to have an engaging political discussion” [4]. Over three-quarters of the participants provided positive feedback for the following round of events [5].  After the first edition of ""Germany Talks"", the Zeit ONLINE newsroom received extensive national and international media attention by organizations and news outlets expressing interest in replicating the project within their countries to encourage discussion and networks that bridge political divides [2]. As the original team of journalists organized workshops with partners from around the world, the event evolved into an international platform that would be applicable and efficient in the context of various countries [4]. This was followed by a continuation of the Germany Talks series on a national level.  Summer 2018 marked the launch of the software and project called My Country Talks, “which today is a tool that newsrooms, governments, civil society organizations or NGOs can use to start one-on-one discussions in their countries” [4]. As of 2020, “it has been used in more than 10 countries for national events” [4].  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The tool is financed partly by Google [4] “and all partners are working on the project in [...] honorary capacity” [6].  The founding team is made of the editor-in-chief of ZEIT ONLINE, Jochen Wegner, along with editors:Maria Exner (Editor-in-Chief of ZEIT Magazin)  Philip Faigle (Special Projects Editor of ZEIT ONLINE)  Sebastian Horn (Deputy Editor in Chief of ZEIT ONLINE) [2]The team includes:Hanna Israel (Project Lead)  Sara Cooper (Technical Project Manager)  Ulrike Zimmerman (Project Manager) [2] Signing upThe website has a “General Terms and Conditions” document that outlines all agreements for “the Good Conversations gGmbH and Organisations (“Partner” or “Partners”) that apply and register for an event under the “My Country Talks” platform. (“Event” or “MCT Event”)” [7].  Satisfying the requirements allows independent media organisations, non-profit organisations or other public interest organisations to become a Partner that can apply to organize an Event with My Country Talks [7].  Partners and SponsorsMy Country Talks is funded by the Federal Foreign Office (foreign ministry of Germany), European Cultural Foundation (Netherlands-based), Allianz Kulturstiftung (for Europe) and Foundation Hippocrene (for Europe) [2].  The program was made possible by the collaboration between Zeit ONLINE and European media organizations. As of October 2021, the following are partners of My Country Talks: Daily Mirror (Britain), Republik (Switzerland), Delfi (Estonia and Latvia), Efimerida ton Syntakton (Greece), Gazeta Wyborcza (Poland), Politiken (Denmark), la Repubblica (Italy), Der Standard (Austria), Helsingin Sanomat (Finland), Arte (France and Germany), HuffPost (USA) bTV Media Group (Bulgaria), LRT.lt (Lithuania), Knack (Belgium), NRK (Norway) [2]. The City University of New York and the Robert Bosch Foundation were also involved in the project [6], however, their role 2019 and onward is unclear.  The first edition of Europe Talks, taking place in 2019, was supported by 17 European media organizations across Europe: bTV Media Group (Bulgaria), Calea Europeana (Romania), Delfi (Estonia and Latvia), De Volkskrant (the Netherlands), Der Standard (Austria), Efimerida Ton Syntakton (Greece), Expresso (Portugal), France24 (France), Gazeta Wyborcza (Poland), HotNews (Romania), Kapital (Slovakia), La Repubblica (Italy), LRT.lt (Lithuania), Mirror (Great Britain), Phoenix (Germany), Politiken (Denmark), Republik (Switzerland) [8].  Europe Talks 2019 was sponsored by the aforementioned sponsors of My Country Talks: Federal Foreign Office (due to the German Presidency of the Council of the European Union 2020 [8]) European Cultural Foundation and Allianz Kulturstiftung. The sponsors also include Stiftung Mercator, the Evans Foundation, Interrail and Centre for Fine Arts Brussels [9] as well as the partnership with the Goethe Institute [8].  Meanwhile, Europe Talks 2020 had 24 sponsors [10].  Specializations, Methods and ToolsSpecializationOn September 28, 2021, an online seminar by Sara Cooper, Technical Project Lead, My Country Talks, and Zeit ONLINE was presented on the International News Media Association (INMA). The webinar was titled “Driving an Innovative Culture in Media to Stay Relevant: Die Zeit's My Country Talks” and they delved into details along with technicalities of their platform [11]. They concluded that “Die Zeit's unique matching algorithm makes it easy for media to fight polarisation, arguably one of the most important issues facing society today” [11].Software and its MethodsMy Country Talks’ software around strategy and design was developed by diesdas.digital - a Berlin-based agency - which describes itself as “the digital-default brand and product studio for leading brands with attitude” [12]. They worked in collaboration with a European group of media organizations: Morgenbladet (Norway), La Repubblica (Italy) and Der Standard (Austria) [4].  With the platform of My Country Talks, “news organisations [are] able to set up their own projects [through] a widget with questions for them to embed, as well as take care of the algorithmic matching, communication and event organisation aspects” [13]. This is done through the “Become a Partner” or “Host an Event” option on the website of My Country Talks [14].  The matching algorithm is tagged “Tinder for Politics” [15]. Based on the participants' answers to simple yes-or-no questions on up-to-date political issues, participants are paired with a partner with whom they share vastly different opinions. In the initial stages of the platform, the partners were also chosen from those living within close proximity. However, during the Covid-19 pandemic the events are being facilitated on digital platforms and the emphasis on location of participants has changed [15].  Major Projects and EventsGermany TalksIn 2018, the year after the first edition of Germany Talks, several more events were organized on the national level, with the intention of achieving visibility and awareness from the public [4].  For the second Germany Talks event, about 20,000 people had registered within only a month [5].Major developments were made after the first edition. For example, the team invited “experts on polarization to analyse the current atmosphere for political discussion in the country” [4] and German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier headed the conference [4]. After 13 My Country Talks national events, the team carried the project across borders.   Europe TalksIn May 2019, Europe Talks was created. My Country Talks evolved into a “pan-European experiment” [9], in which “thousands of participants from across the continent [...] meet for one-on-one conversations to discuss issues that matter to all Europeans” [16].Europe Talks 2019: The first event of the series took place on May 11 as Zeit ONLINE team partnered with 17 European media partners and involved more than 16,200 participants across 33 countries [9].  Europe Talks 2020: The second event of the series was held on December 13 with 24 partners and 12,460 participants from 34 countries [17].  Europe Talks 2021: The third event took place in October 2021 [15].Between 2019-21, My Country Talks organized a record number of events across Europe [15].Germany Talks during the Coronavirus PandemicOn May 10, 2020, another Germany Talks event was organized. 6,500 participants met to discuss the coronavirus pandemic and measures against it - for the first time, via video call. The event was in cooperation with German news outlets: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the Schwäbische Zeitung, the Rheinische Post, Chrismon and evangelisch.de [18].   America TalksMy Country Talks “joined the #ListenFirst coalition of over 300 organizations to develop America Talks, a full-scale, nation-wide event that [took] place as part of the National Week of Conversation” [19]. The partners were USA Today and the USA Today Network, which also promoted participation in the event to its readers across 46 states. Other partners included Yahoo News, AllSides, The Fulcrum and WITF; one of the organizers was Pearce Godwin, founder and CEO of Listen First Project [19].  On June 12-13, 2021, the first America Talks event was held with over 500 participants. On September 20, 2021, America Talks hosted another event to discuss the “impact of infrastructure [...] and explore what [...] representatives in government should do about it” [20] so that results can be shared with Congress.My City TalksOn July 4, 2021, the first My City Talks event took place in Marburg. The “hyperlocal format was created to help people fight polarisation in their city, and bring local government and journalists into conversation with citizens about issues that affect their day-to-day lives” [21]. It was launched on May 17 by the University of Marburg, in cooperation with the Oberhessische Press as well as nonprofit organizations and local community groups [21]. Dr. Thomas Spies, Mayor of Marburg, initiated the event [21].

It has received the following awards: the Jean Monnet Prize for European Integration, the Grimme Online Award, the IPRA President's Award and the Nannen Prize [2].Goals of My Country TalksInternational attention:  The program gained international attention and acclaim; therefore, other countries also adopted the format. In 2018-19, similar programs were held in Austria, Switzerland, Finland, Belgium, Norway, Denmark, and Britain [23]. A major example was on June 10, 2018, when La Repubblica and HuffPost Italia hosted a similar event in La Repubblica's festival located in Bologna [24], which was followed by further events to build up on the initial test.Open debate:  “The ultimate goal is a less polarized debate and a less polarized, more open, and plural public” [25] where people can engage in meaningful discussion on the same topic. Surveys conducted after discussions provide insight into participants changing some of their opinions, being convinced by their partner and answering the same questions differently due to the discussions [26].Respect and safety:  To enable a respectful, natural, and troll-free atmosphere, the team did advance background checks on participants [25].Networking:  As the team worked for the inclusion of different voices, there were many stories of networking and friendship-building between participants.Making an impact:  The goal was not to impact governmental decision making or advocate for certain stances by working directly with the government. Instead, the team of journalists found the solution in acting as the “neutral [and] polite hosts you can trust not to use your data” [25].Receiving and acting on feedback:  The feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Based on the suggestions received, most of the events made adjustments for the rest of the series or the following events.Positivity:  The following are the results of a survey after a My Country Talks event:“80% of participants on average say they were happy with their conversation  60% of participants on average say they intend to stay in touch with their conversation partner after the event ends  90% of participants on average give the feedback that they look forward to participating in another MCT event” [27]Publications""General Terms and Conditions for the Organization of a My Country Talks-Event"":https://www.mycountrytalks.org/uploads/Terms-of-Service-My-Country-Talks.pdfSee Also  Social Media accounts of My Country Talks:Twitter:https://twitter.com/mycountrytalks   Instagram:https://www.instagram.com/mycountrytalks/Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/countrytalksYouTube Channel:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH_560Y9-hGLMW53BiDZPUw About My Country Talks:Monthly newsletter:https://www.mycountrytalks.org/events/contactMedium Website:https://mycountrytalks.medium.comTed Talks profile of John Wegner, Editor in Chief of Zeit ONLINE:https://www.ted.com/speakers/jochen_wegnerReferences  [1]  https://www.mycountrytalks.org[2]  https://www.mycountrytalks.org/events/about[3]  https://www.mycountrytalks.org/events/past-events/germany-talks-2017[4]  https://constructiveinstitute.org/how/contributions/how-to-connect-people-in-polarized-communities/[5]  https://www.involve.org.uk/resources/case-studies/my-country-talks[6]  https://www.zeit-verlagsgruppe.de/pressemitteilung/my-country-talks-zeit-online-a-leading-german-news-website-and-respected-international-partners-are-developing-a-digital-platform-for-political-debate/[7]  https://www.mycountrytalks.org/uploads/Terms-of-Service-My-Country-Talks.pdf[8]  https://culturalfoundation.eu/stories/europe-talks/[9]  https://www.mycountrytalks.org/events/past-events/europe-talks-2019[10]  https://www.mycountrytalks.org/events/past-events/europe-talks-2020[11]  https://www.inma.org/webinars/driving-an-innovative-culture-in-media-to-stay-relevant-die-zeits-my-country-talks[12]  https://www.diesdas.digital[13]  https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/inside-3-organisations-approach-to-community-minded-journalism/s2/a720367/[14]  https://www.mycountrytalks.org/events/host-an-event[15]  https://mycountrytalks.medium.com/my-country-talks-shortlisted-for-the-nannen-prize-deb3559a1dea[16]  https://www.mycountrytalks.org/events/europe-talks[17]  https://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/2020-12/europe-talks-debate-opinions-topics-participants[18]  https://www.mycountrytalks.org/events/past-events/germany-talks-2020[19]  https://mycountrytalks.medium.com/america-talks-edc339055ad2[20]  https://americatalks.us[21]  https://mycountrytalks.medium.com/my-city-talks-817f79856a2c[22]  https://www.mycountrytalks.org/events[23]  https://centerforinterculturaldialogue.org/tag/my-country-talks/[24]  https://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2018-06/l-italia-si-parla-bologna-my-country-talks-english[25]  https://www.niemanlab.org/2018/08/in-germany-a-news-site-is-pairing-up-liberals-and-conservatives-and-actually-getting-them-to-gasp-have-a-civil-conversation/[26]  https://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/2021-09/germany-talks-debate-election-germany-data-participants-english[27]  https://www.mycountrytalks.org/events/impactExternal LinksDocuments by My Country Talks:Privacy Policy for the website mycountrytalks.org:http://www.mycountrytalks.org/privacy-policyPrivacy Policy for Europe Talks:https://www.mycountrytalks.org/europe-talks-privacy-policyTerms of Service and DPA (General Terms and Conditions for the Organization of an My Country Talks-Event):https://www.mycountrytalks.org/terms-of-serviceImpressum Good Conversations:https://www.mycountrytalks.org/imprintUpdates on My Country Talks:https://linktr.ee/mycountrytalksResponsibilities and Experience of “Project Lead for My Country Talks”:https://zeit-verlagsgruppe.softgarden.io/job/6777281?l=deArticles about My Country Talks:Financial Times article:https://ig.ft.com/europe-talks/Article by the website of Goethe Institute - a sponsor:https://www.goethe.de/en/kul/ges/21497299.htmlScientific study about My Country Talks:https://www.zeit.de/wissen/2019-08/armin-falk-germany-talks-behaviour-research-englishInterview published on My Country Talks:https://mycountrytalks.medium.com/an-interview-with-david-broockman-1283c80e65c5Notes ",1,0,4,2,0,

It is Marxist in orientation and has a national reach [1]. Specifically, it seeks to expand the capacity of  communal councils  and related institutions to achieve an economy self-managed and self-governed by peasants and workers.  According to their website:  “[t]he CRBZ is a space for participation and meeting of any person who wants to fight for the construction of a more just and democratic society, for the good life of the people and a better world, which necessarily implies the construction of a different alternative to the capitalist system.”[2].  The mission of the CRZB is to deepen the revolutionary transformation in the Venezuelan countryside by organizing peasant take-overs of unused land and organizing cooperative and communal structures. Often it organizes peasant communities against retaliatory violence from landlords and corrupt elements of the state bureaucracy.  Origins and Development  The CRBZ is composed of four constituent organizations: the Ezequiel Zamora Peasant National Front; the Simon Bolivar National Communal Front; Workers Popular Power Movement; and the Centre for Training and Social Study Simón Rodríguez. The first two have been active in land-occupations and the construction of  communal councils . The CRBZ has a national reach, organizing in in dozens of rural Venezuelan states like Guarico, Apure, Lara, and Barinas.  The Ezequiel Zamora Peasant National Front is the oldest part of the CRBZ. In 1998 and 1999 it was working with rural people to organize agrarian reform [3]. The 2001 Land and Agricultural Development Law enabled this organization to undertake lawful occupations of unused land [4]. In one instance, the Ezequiel Zamora Peasant National Front organized the occupation and re-starting of production of part of a farm previously expropriated by the state to distribute to landless peasants. In this way they immediately attained 500 hectares of land, machinery, and financing to organize a local cooperative [1].  In 2005 the Ezequiel Zamora Peasant National Front grouped together 350 popular democratic communal councils to build the Simon Bolivar National Communal Front as a popular democratic to the existing state and capitalist economy. One organizer describes their first steps in the following way:  “We began our communal work in the state of Apure, a very difficult area to do grassroots organizing because of thefts, contraband, irregular forces that exist along the border (with Colombia), paramilitaries, and assassinations carried out by local elites. There in Apure we got started. The first thing we did was to bring together 39 communal councils and form eight communes. Once that was accomplished, we formed the country’s first communal city, now known as the Simon Bolivar Socialist Campesino Communal City (CCCS-SB).” [3]  While the origins of the CRBZ pre-date the election of Hugo Chávez, it’s membership and organizing of popular democratic institutions exploded under the reforms of the Bolivarian Revolution. Today, the CRBZ is a permanent feature of the Bolivarian process that organizes cooperatives, communal councils, and collective production. Thus in working with the legal frameworks established by the government, the CRBZ evolved over time from a national peasant organization into one that uses  communal councils  to build an alternative to both oil dependence and a bureaucratic state rooted in participatory democracy.  Historically, Venezuela has been an importer of food due in part because of the oil economy and land ownership was extremely concentrated. Drawing from the discourse of food sovereignty and re-engaging in production, the CRBZ uses popular democracy to address the issues of food scarcity and rural inequality in land ownership.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The CRBZ has central structures of spokespeople who coordinate activities nationally. Within their communal wing, affiliated communal councils operate within the legal regulations established by the Special Law on Communal Councils, the Organic Law of the Communes, and the Organic Law on the Communal Economic System [5]. In this respect, the highest decision making in the neighbourhood level is in the Citizen Assembly with elected spokespeople appointed to manage day-to-day activities. Chapters exist throughout Venezuela.  Start-up funding for cooperative and communal production initiatives, as well as technical assistance, have historically come from the Ministry of Agriculture, the National Institute of Rural Development (INDER), the National Institute of Lands (INTI), and the National Institutefor Agricultural Health [1]. Additionally, the INITI is the legal organ responsible for transferring ownership of occupied lands. These state organs have been denounced by activists for the bureaucratic and corrupt way they are run and delays in grants agrarian charters to legalize occupied land [4,6]. Conflicts have included marches and office occupations.  At a grass-roots level, ultimate decision making on financial issues is made by the Citizen’s Assemblies of each communal council and commune. Each communal council appoint sits own members to run a Unit of Financial Administration that makes day-to-day management decisions over finances [5]. At the level of the commune, each communal council elects a spokesperson to a Communal Parliament which approves a Communal Development Plan. Each commune has a Communal Bank that manages financing to realize the plan.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The CRBZ plays a catalyzing role in organizing communal councils, setting up social owned production, and expanding participatory democracy into the economy and politics of the areas where they organize. It creates participatory communal councils through organizing land occupations and re-igniting food production. Activities use to achieve this include neighbourhood assemblies, community censuses, community elections, participatory planning, participatory budgeting, co-managed farms, and co-managed municipalities [7].  Major Projects and Events  The CRBZ has organized several major projects including Simon Bolivar Socialist Campesino Communal City and the establishment of new communal councils throughout Venezuela. Additionally it has participated in the 2017 National Constituent Assembly and the 2018 Admirable Campesino March [8].  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The CRBZ has pursued a dual strategy of building communal councils as expressing participatory democracy while running candidates for the United Social Party (PSUV) in municipalities where they actively organize [1]. This strategy is described by Dario Azzellini as two track construction of socialism [1]. CRBZ spokespeople have said this works well as they use the municipal offices to buttress the decisions made by participatory institutions [9].

Their central goal is to establish socialism in Venezuela on the basis of democratizing economic production [1]. They aim to do this by beating the economic war against Venezuela by reviving idle state-owned workplaces with the active participation of working class people. Dubbed  Productive Workers’ Battles , the EPO aims to revive idle factories by promoting  workers’ councils  while empowering workers through participatory education and volunteer-work to run their own workplaces.  Origins and Development  The EPO was established in 2016. It traces its roots to the factory occupations of the Indorca , Calderys , and EQUIPETROL factories in the Guyana industrial region. These occupied plants were nationalized by the state but re-activated and operated by the workers themselves. In 2016, workers from these plants were invited to engage in the first  Productive Workers’ Battle  to re-start production at a fish-processing plant across the country [2]. The EPO led volunteer brigades that took direction from workers’ councils but solicited aid from workers with specialized knowledge across Venezuela. After a series of successful factory re-starts the state began materially supporting these initiatives by appointing lead organizers to head state-owned corporations aiming to re-start production [3]. Under this period the volunteer network of workers striving to re-start production nationally crystallized into the autonomous yet revolutionary EPO.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Members were initially drawn from the  Indorca , Calderys , and EQUIPETROL factories. The area where they are concentrated is known for long histories of militant unions and radical  strikes  [4]. Overall the EPO has become a volunteer labour network with dispersed operating areas drawing on participants from public and privately owned factories [1][2]. The  Productive Workers’ Battles  organized by the EPO had state funding for a short period of time, however, conflict over participatory organizing tactics caused friction with state funders [5]. The lack of state funding and the COVID-19 pandemic has decisively slowed down EPO organizing.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The EPO facilitates a network of volunteer machinists and engineers through  workers’ councils  to revive state-owned factories that have become idle. Working with grassroots workers in councils is part of their concerted strategy to build socialism on the basis of democracy in the economy.  Major Projects and Events  The EPO labels every event of re-starting production at an idle factory as a  productive workers’ battle . Through these events, the EPO aims to build self-esteem and self-organization of workers – who once struggled for the nationalization of their factories, yet now were looking at the prospect of their workplaces being abandoned.

Our light central structure and ability to innovate and adapt mean that EPD is ideally placed to make a difference in a changing, dynamic and unpredictable world. Our collective strength allows us to understand the evolving challenges in political systems and democratic governance, to build evidence of what works - and what doesn’t - and to tackle programmes in ways that respond to the complexity of the challenge.  EPD has direct insight and hands-on experience of the various dimensions of democratic governance that must work in parallel in a functioning democracy. This is because we bring together organisations with a solid track-record, vast external reach, strong relationships with key domestic actors and specialisations of working on:different fields of democracy support : media support, civic tech, political parties, local authorities, elections, the rule of law, women’s participation, parliamentary support, multi-stakeholder dialogue, political and civil rights, civil society capacity building, ICT and civic and political education;different levels of society : political leadership, elected representatives, state officials, civil society and grassroots community representatives.We work with state and non-state actors in Europe and abroad. EPD brings this expertise together in order to combat the traditional approach of working in silos. This wealth of knowledge means that EPD is a veritable centre of expertise for democracy support.  Through focusing on the whole of the democratic system, EPD is also able to look at the links between actors rather than just the actors themselves. These links are frequently missed even if it is clear that changes in one element of the system produce intended and unintended ripple effects on other parts of the system.  It is also through this diverse knowledge and experience that EPD is able to take a bird’s eye view of the challenges affecting democracy and provide analysis and research for the benefit of all those supporting democracy around the world. From our headquarters in Brussels we centralise information from around Europe and likewise feed information from Brussels to European states through our members. We have proven that we can make a difference in the policy space based on the evidence from our research and our field experience.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  EPD is conceived as a “Community of practice“. That is, a group of organisations which work together because, by doing so, they can substantially improve the way they operate in the realm of democracy support. This notion does not only apply to EPD as a network and its institutional development, but also to all the actions and partnerships constructed under the EPD banner.  The following organisations are members of EPD and have signed the EPD statutes. All members take part in the General Assembly that governs the organisation and where seven members are elected to the EPD Board for a period of 2 years. From these 7 board members, a President, Vice-President and Treasurer are elected for the duration of the 2-year period.Article 19  CFI Media Development  Danish Institute for Parties and Democracy (DIPD)  Democracy Reporting International  Demo Finland  EDGE  Elbarlament  Election Watch  European Association for Local Democracy (ALDA)  European ExchangeePaństwo FoundationNetherlands Helsinki Committee  Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy (NIMD)  Oslo Center  People in Need  Catholic University of Portugal  Westminster Foundation for Democracy  World Leadership Alliance - Club de MadridEPD main sources of funding are reported  here .  Specializations  EPD’s uniqueness as an organisation is our horizontal and vertical coverage of the key players within a democratic system and our ability to straddle the academic, policy and practitioner worlds. Our ability to innovate and adapt, means that we are ideally placed to make a difference in a changing, dynamic and unpredictable world. Our toolkit for working on our multi-annual priorities is based on the three pillars constituting the core of the EPD approach: knowledge, advocacy and programmes.Advocacy:  We actively work towards improving democracy support policies and advising on foreign policies that can reinforce democracy in the face of global challenges. Through our head office in Brussels, we play a key role in contributing to improving democracy support policies, working closely with EU institutions, European governments, and building civil society coalitions together with our partners.Programmes : We bring together the expertise of specialists from various sectors of democracy support (parliaments, parties, elections, human rights, media, executive leadership, ICT etc.) on joint programmes in which we apply our in-house methods for creating political dialogue and behavioural changes. EPD and its members’ programmes focus on Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.Knowledge : We push the boundaries of democratic thinking and facilitate the exchange of experiences and lessons learned amongst practitioners from different sectors of the democracy support community. Our research investigates gaps in the democracy field and helps us inform our advocacy work.ApproachesThe members of EPD have come together to create various joint approaches that make the most of the  comparative advantage of the network  . Due to the expertise from different sectors and the variety of experience in terms of partners, EPD is able to take a more holistic approach to democratic development. All the  constituent elements of a political system are interlinked  and it is therefore paramount for links to be made between specialists from different fields of democracy support. EPD has developed different joint approaches that are implemented around the world, either stand alone or within other projects. You can find out more by clicking on the links below.INSPIREDis a method of policy dialogue that aims to promote transparency and accountability by guiding policy dialogue through three phases: collective assessment, consensus-building, and monitoring . In particular, it encourages international aid organisations and practitioners to make use of policy dialogue, by enhancing its inclusiveness and putting in place participatory mechanisms that make it more representative and legitimate. Its main assumption is that policies that have been elaborated taking into account different interests and view points are more likely to resist sudden changes in the balance of powers than policies that benefit only a small ruling elite.SPACEis a 3-step approach that has been developed to design programmes and projects that contribute to creating space for civil society, drawing on the unique mix of skills and expertise of 18 European organisations that support democracy in more than 100 countries worldwide.  It starts out with a Democratic Institutions for a Conducive Environment (DICE) assessment aimed at creating a better understanding of how democratic institutions drive or hinder the development of civil society space in the country. DICE is tailored to the local context, as it uses tools for stakeholder mapping and Political Economy Analysis (PEA) to identify opportunities for influencing positive change.PublicationsThe Digital-Democracy-Development Nexus: How to effectively advance the EU’s Digital Policy abroad , EPD, 2021Toward a New Era of European Support to Political Party Systems , EPD, 2021Thinking Democratically: A Comprehensive Approach to Countering and Preventing ""Shrinking Space"" , EPD, 2020Programming for Democracy: A how-to guide for different areas of democratic support , EPD, 2020Louder than words?

[1]  They do this through organizing training programs, community outreach, and mobilizing for protests among youth aged 15 to 35. GYEM seeks environmental sustainability which involves clean air and water, sustainable food and energy, and protected lands and oceans for posterity. [2] They believe young people are well-skilled for environmental campaigning because they are most vulnerable to environmental damage and climate change.  Origins and Development  The groundwork for GYEM’s formation began in the year 2010 with their first campaign in 2012. This group was started by a group of young activists led by Gideon Commey, a young activist who had embarked on environmental sanitation campaigns at the University of Ghana Campus and the Accra community. Upon seeing the eroded shores of Keta, Ghana, as a result of rising sea levels in the area, he decided to take action on climate and environmental policy in Ghana. [3]Gideon Commey, along with Newton Abubakar Zico, Abdulai Abubakr, and Mariama Sawodogo Kareem established the Ghana Youth Environmental Movement in Madina, Accra. [4]  Meetings were first held in pubs and bars. However, these venues became too expensive to continue holding meetings, leading them to gather in the homes of founding members with family support until they secured an office space in 2018. [5]  By 2012 they had a first official meeting to adopt a framework and constitution, then came up with the name Ghana Youth Environmental Movement (GYEM). The organization grew by drawing from online networks from previous non-environmental activist projects the founding members had engaged in such as “Share-your-lunch Ghana”. [6]On November 7, 2012, they engaged in their first non-violent campaign where they “gatecrashed” the inauguration of the National Environmental Policy on November 7, 2012, to express their exasperation with the “conferences, summits, the teas, and committees that were lacking in commensurate action” [7]  With placards, masks, and t-shirts with the inscription “IMPLEMENT THE POLICY”, they attracted attention from the government officials and other dignitaries at the event.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  GYEM is comprised of a 7-member board of advisors, an 8-member management team and a steering group with members representing the Ahafo, Ashanti, Bono, North East, Oti, Bono East, Central, Eastern, Greater Accra, Volta, Western, Western North. Northern, Savannah, Upper East, and Upper West regions of Ghana. [8]  Membership of GYEM is completely voluntary, however, they target both rural and urban youth from the ages of 15-35 across the country. The group currently has over 500 registered members across Ghana. [9]Some of their past projects were mainly funded by grants from partnering organizations such as the International Secretariat for Water (ISW) and  t he Business Sector Advocacy Challenge (BUSAC) Fund.  Membership dues also support the running of the organization.  Specializations, Methods, and Tools  GYEM uses non-violent campaigns to petition the government to take favorable environmental policy. Some of these non-violent campaigns take the form of direct action, where they occupy buildings such as the ministry of energy, environmental protection agency, and the like, press conferences, and walks through the city with banners and placards. Their main goal is environmental advocacy, which also includes social media activism.  Their projects are also facilitated through partnerships with environmental groups such as A Rocha Ghana, Hipsters of Nature, Green Africa Youth Organisation, Institute for Sustainable Energy and Environmental Solutions, Let’s do it Ghana and Mother of all Nations Foundation. They connect with these groups through social media and other informal networks. This coalition-building is facilitated by joint meetings followed by what they describe as an organic way of working together because of their common mission.  Major Projects and Events  GYEM has carried out several non-violent protests based on national and global environmental issues; some initiated by the group and others in support of other groups that they partner with.  In 2016, they embarked on a “No Coal Campaign” in which they occupied buildings at the Ministry of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency in Ghana to protest a deal between the Government of Ghana and the Shenzhen Energy Group to establish a 700MW supercritical coal-fired power plant, at Ekumfi Aboano in the Central region of Ghana, sourcing coal from South Africa. This campaign was carried out to prevent coal, a harmful fossil fuel, from being introduced into Ghana’s energy mix.Current ProjectsThey are currently also starting a new project called the “Single-Use Plastics Campaign” geared at pushing the government to rid Ghana of single plastic use.  They are currently supporting A Rocha Ghana’s “Save Atewa Campaign” aimed at stopping the Ghanaian government from mining bauxite in the rich Atewa forest in the Eastern Region of Ghana.  Besides these non-violent campaigns, GYEM also organizes training for young people in Environmental Advocacy through their year-long Ghana Young Environmentalist Programme and their Green Clubs in Schools Project in partnership with swiss universities Science Action in Schools for Sustainable Development (SAS4SD) Consortia for Education and Research. Their annual flagship program “Powershift” brings together young people across Ghana to discuss an environmental issue in Ghana and possible responses to it.  [10]   GYEM also engages in community outreach projects, such as the “Kyensu” (an Akan Word for “Share water”) where they built a water kiosk in Treba- a peri-urban community in the Greater Accra region with perpetual water shortage to satisfy this need. [11]Analysis and Lessons Learned  GYEM has a strong skill for partnership formation. Most of their projects are carried out with support from other renowned non-profit organizations. Their activism is also very wide-ranging considering that they do not only “hit the streets” to advocate for better environmental policies from the government, but also take the initiative to solve environmental problems through projects like “Kyensu” and the Green Schools project.  The presence of a steering committee across all the regions in Ghana presents them with the opportunity to influence a wider audience in fairly rural parts of Ghana. However, the voluntary nature of the group makes it difficult to have strong branches outside Ghana’s capital, Accra. 500+ members is a large number, but it appears hard for the leadership of GYEM to determine what percentage of this membership is active in pursuing their mission  .Publications  GYEM’s publications can be found on their  website·GYEM partners SAS4SD in a 2-year ‘Green Clubs in Schools Project:https://gyemgh.org/blog/gyem-partners-sas4sd-in-a-2-year-green-clubs-in-schools-project.html·The 2020 Goldman Environmental Prize for Africa: Setting the Record Straight – Facts about Ghana’s Coal Campaign (2013-2016) &amp; Problems Arising from the Current Narrative:https://gyemgh.org/blog/the-2020-goldman-environmental-prize-for-africa-setting-the-record-straight-facts-about-ghanas-coal-campaign-2013-2016-problems-arising-from-the-current-narrative.htmlContact informationEmail  :  info@gyem.org  /  gyemgh@gmail.comTwitter:@gyemghFacebook:Ghana Youth Environmental MovementInstagram:gyemghAddress :  Hse No. 163 Racecourse Street, Tabora-Accra, GhanaPhone number :  +233 (0) 541 295 774  See Also  Ghanaian Youth Keen on Saving the Environment :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTQuXd3f8LcGYEM TV Environmental Channel:  https://www.youtube.com/user/GYEMGH  Footnotes[1]  “GYEM Ghana.”[2]  “GYEM Ghana.”[3]  Commey Gideon,  Making a Change, a Comprehensive Guide for Leaders  (CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform), 2017.on}[4]  Asamoah-Gyadu, “On the Frontlines.”[5]  Commey Gideon,  Making a Change, a Comprehensive Guide for Leaders  (CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform), 2017.[6]  “(2) Share-Your-Lunch Ghana | Facebook.”[7]  “ Commey Gideon,  Making a Change, a Comprehensive Guide for Leaders  (CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform), 2017.

The Nigerian budget remains a thick document with dismal performance, especially in capital projects implementation.  [1]  Cases of poor data management and analysis in the Nigerian government have continued to affect government projects’ accuracy and hinder accountability and transparency of government operations.  [2]To tackle this, BudgIT’s services are classified into four: “providing simplified access to budgets and public finance data; project monitoring for efficient service delivery; promoting accountability and fiscal inclusion in the extractive industries, and collaboration with government and stakeholders such as media and civil society institutions.  [3]  Origins and DevelopmentIn February 2011, Co-Creation Hub (a technology-oriented centre dedicated to social capital acceleration to ensure development in various spheres) organized a 48-hour Tech-In-Series event.  [4]  The BudgIT team emerged second of the three contenders where they came up with the idea for open data access of government spending for public knowledge. As part of its reward, Co-Creation Hub provided BudgIT with financial resources and office space to carry out its projects. In 2019, with Oluseun Onigbinde and Joseph Agunbiade as co-founders of BudgIT, BudgIT metamorphosed from two to thirty full-time staff and twenty-nine project tracking officers charged with monitoring budgetary activities in 33 states in Nigeria.  [5]  The annual budgets (state and federal) contain projects that meet the basic amenities required by Nigerians, such as road network, electricity, water supply, healthcare facilities, and education. BudgIT seeks to promote accountability and transparency in government budgets and expenditures through its published reports and infographics by providing a platform for Nigerians to access Nigerian budgetary activities. Nigerian States experience human development issues such as poverty, unemployment, underemployment, avoidable disease outbreaks (excluding COVID -19), and a host of third-world problems. The disease outbreaks include cholera, monkeypox, measles, Cerebro-spinal meningitis, Lassa fever, and Yellow fever. According to BudgIT, to solve these issues, each state needs to be a sustainable subnational entity. Each state should generate enough revenue to meet its capital and recurrent expenditure.  [6]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingBudgIT is headed by Gabriel Okeowo (Chief Executive Officer),  Oluseun Onigbinde (Director), Joseph Agunbiade (Technology Lead), and Mercy Titus (Finance Lead).  [7]  There are thirty full-time staff and interns are sourced from the National Youth Service Corps(NYSC), a one-year mandatory service for Nigerian graduates. The Research and Advocacy department comprises seven people charged with research, data spreading, data analysis, policy advocacy, and budget analysis. For full-time positions, the recruitment process is need-based in which an advert is put out on its social media platforms. Applicants are interviewed and asked scenario-based questions to emphasize skills and capacity rather than academic qualifications and experience.  [8]    The volunteers referred to as community champions are available in the thirty-three states with BudgIT visibility. There are also service delivery trackers of about 15,000 who conduct field investigations of government projects in various states. Its social media accounts (Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook) boast thousands of followers, creating awareness on government projects in their respective communities. Physical offices are situated in Nigeria (Lagos and Abuja), Ghana, and Sierra Leone.  [9]  The availability of funds plays an influential role in ensuring the success of projects and the attainment of objectives. BudgIT’s financial capability has evolved through grants (primarily international) and donations. The Tony Elumelu Foundation and Co-Creation Hub supported BudgIT’s project execution in the first six months of its establishment. In 2013, BudgIT’s total revenue from grants, consulting, and competitions were 34.9 million Naira (US$96,600). In 2014, BudgIT received up to  $400,000  in grants from Omidyar Network, while MacArthur Foundation  awarded $550,000  between 2018 and 2019.  [10]  Other financial partners include The Global Health Advocacy Incubator (GHAI), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Oxfam, The Indigo, Luminate, Ford Foundation, Open Society Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA), and United Nations Democracy Fund (UNDEF).  [11]  Also, BudgIT seeks donations through its “Donate” option on its official website  -https://yourbudgit.com/. To maintain its non-partisan position, BudgIT has avoided local funding opportunities from individuals and organizations.Specializations, Methods and ToolsBudgIT implements community-driven development and community monitoring methods in achieving its vision. On the one hand, community-driven development “empowers participating citizens and communities to control the development process, resources, and decision-making to address their self-identified needs.  [12]On the other hand,    community monitoring features local population as a check on the implementation of government projects through oversight and reporting of service quality, efficiency, and efficacy.  [13]  Following its vision: “to see a community of active citizens that relentlessly make effective use of public information to demand accountability, geared for institutional improvement, efficient services delivery, and an equitable society”  [14]  BudgIT has adopted tools that endeavors to simplify Nigerian budgets and public data to aid understanding and accessibility across every literacy span. These tools include citizen reporting, monitoring platforms, town halls, direct advocacy, infographics, public rallies, data sourcing, and analysis carried out at Federal, State, and local levels. BudgIT makes use of Traka, a project-tracking tool for investigating the implementation and execution of government projects. It allows individuals to register complaints about abandoned or dysfunctional infrastructure projects in and around their communities. Tracka is visible in thirty-two states in Nigeria, excluding Jigawa, Yobe, Borno, and Zamfara due to their poor audit process.  [15]According to Oluseun Onigbinde, “tech tools have enabled us to scrutinize the budget and, melded with boots on the ground, curate the status of projects.”  [16]Also, BudgIT collaborates with startups, civic organizations, encouraging civic responsibility and tackling injustice using technology tools.    There is also the collaboration with the National Assembly Budget and Research Office; and the Budget Office of the Federation. In 2013, BudgIT worked with 28 civil society organizations and presented the Nigerian budget at 32 civil society sessions. In 2017, the organization had 55 civil society partners and implemented new public communications tools, including e-tools, SMS, a regular radio program, and social media. In summary, its services are carried out through community outreach, technological initiatives, digital organizing, workshops, citizens engagement, mentorship programs, and policy advocacy.  Major Projects and EventsBudgIT activities are implemented in five stages: data mining, data verification, creative display, sharing and feedback through  fiscal analyses, civic technology, and data representation. Citizen reporting allows Nigerians to submit a report on government projects within their communities. To ensure the accuracy of data provided to citizens, BudgIT collaborates with relevant government agencies such as the National Bureau of Statistics, Debt Management Office, Nigerian Centre for Disease Control. The project execution begins with project selection, which starts with internal conversations, data analysis by state, and available funds. The project is assigned to a full-time staff to serve as a team lead and deployment of service delivery trackers to state(s) involved in the project. The service delivery trackers carry out offline and online engagements such as town-hall meetings, engagement in schools/universities, and collaboration with stakeholders. The BudgIT team investigates stories submitted, and its reports are published on its social media platforms and reported to government agencies to ensure that contractors involved are held accountable. After investigation, BudgIT provides government agencies and the populace with its report through Tracka and social media platforms. In each report, loopholes in the project are identified, and solutions are proffered to ensure project completion as stated in the budget.Perhaps, the most effective tool deployed by BudgIT is Tracka, a community-based tool with active citizens tracking the implementation of government projects in their community to ensure service delivery. Tracka can be used in two ways- to track existing projects and to uphold investigative reports on government projects. To track existing projects, BudgIT created a website with a database of government projects which can be searched by sector (education, health, transport) or category (Federal government budgets, State budgets). The status of each project is updated based on “not stated,” “in progress,” “abandoned,” and “completed.” Tracka provides a platform for Nigerians to post pictures of developmental projects in their communities. BudgIT’s project officers aid citizens offline to communicate with their elected representatives and demand completion of the government projects in their neighborhoods.  [17]Tracka’s Project Tracking Officers (PTOs) and Community Champions are assigned to their various communities to investigate government projects and present reports.In November 2020, Tracka, with support from Ford Foundation, kickstarted the community-based civic advocacy project in 24 selected communities across six oil-producing states in the Niger-Delta region. Among other objectives, the project promoted citizen engagement for the beneficiation of natural resources and service delivery. The project team has tracked one hundred and fifty-four (154) projects in the 2020 states’ budget, the Niger Delta Development Commission Budget (NDDC), 2020 Consolidated Capital Projects, and 2020 Zonal Intervention Projects. Of the 154 projects, 60 have been completed, 36 are currently ongoing, 27 have not begun, and 15 are abandoned due to respective agencies’ late release of funds due to the pandemic.  [18]The Covid’19 pandemic affected Nigerians economically due to the loss of jobs and the inability to meet basic needs. BudgIT initiatedCovidFundTraka  to track Covid-19 donations received by Nigeria’s federal and state governments; and 2020 allocations tagged for “COVID-19 response” in each state’s 2020 revised budget. These include allocations for a direct response within and outside the health sector that categorized budget allocations based on state recipient, amount, item, expenditure, type (recurrent or capital), and the specific agency that receives the money.  [19]In 2021, using six states (Niger, Lagos, Kano, Ogun, Enugu, and River) and government agencies as case studies, BudgIt released a report titled “COVID-19 Fund: Fiscal Support, Palliative Analysis &amp; Institutional Response” that reviewed Nigeria’s current fiscal support and institutional response to COVID-19.  [20]  In 2013, BudgIT supported Enough Is Enough (a prominent civic society organization in Nigeria) in the #OpenNass campaign, pushing the National Assembly to create and release a budget of its expenditures. Town halls and public rallies were organized, and citizen petitions were collected and sent to the National Assembly to demonstrate support for transparency. In 2017, the government yielded to the campaign in greater detail than in the past by releasing its past budgets.  [21]      In 2017, BudgIT’s Fix Our Oil campaign altering the lines of authority in issuing petroleum licenses coincided with the Petroleum Industry Governance Bill’s hearings. Along with various “tweet meets” and social media engagements, the organization produced a series of infographics about the bill’s benefits, limitations, and the Nigerian National Petroleum Company budget. This led to the passage of the bill in May 2017 by the Senate.  [22]In 2018, the BudgIT-led conference explored innovative avenues to leverage new media tools towards a progressive democratic society and an electoral system devoid of corrupt practices. The expected outcome was an improved understanding of how new media can advance governance and accountability. In Sierra Leone, BudgIT began ‘BudgIT Hour,’ a bi-weekly civic engagement radio show. The one-hour show airs on the community radio station, Lion Mountain. It plans to host another program on Victory Radio (with a wider national audience) to engage local councils on governance.  [23]Trackaplus  , a program produced by BudgIT in collaboration with a popular Nigerian television station, Channels Television, has been able to successfully find and report on abandoned projects in many communities, particularly on infrastructure projects that have been abandoned.Upon analysis of the 2020 budget, BudgIT successfully ensured the reduction of bloated budget and unnecessary expenses channeled to the provision of basic amenities for the Nigerian population. In 2021, BudgIT made recommendations regarding the wasteful and frivolous items in the National Budget, which successfully removed over 200 items of about 35 billion Naira.  [24]For example, BudgIT exposed a 41 million naira (US$113,575) investment that claimed to be funding a non-existent youth center in Kebbi State. BudgIT mobilized civil outcry on public pay levels by encouraging careful public review of the budget, resulting in a public servant salary cap.In some cases, BudgIT experienced hostility from government officials, especially those indicted due to reports by BudgIT. There is also a threat to the life and safety of staff who are more cautious in their activities. Some staff are arrested, beaten, or captured by the Department of State Services (a security agency in Nigeria), victims of accidents, and kidnapping in remote areas where projects are located. This explains the absence of pictorial representation of staff members on the BudgIT website.  [25]BudgIT ensures simplification of Nigeria’s budgetary information to ease understanding by its citizens. Others include promoting accessibility, accountability, ensuring the provision of basic amenities, promoting compliance with budgetary stipulations, and ensuring the prosecution of corrupt individuals.    In July    2021, BudgIT’s visibility included twenty-six states, 586 local government areas where it has held 7,612 town hall meetings, reached 4,850,000 Nigerians via digital and physical spaces, tracked 15,859 projects, and impacted 9,006 communities.  [26]  Current projectsBudgIT can be described as a “pioneer in the field of social advocacy melded with technology”  [27]  As a Civicus Alliance and Open Alliance member, BudgIT is also leading Nigeria’s global Open Government Partnership membership. BudgIT played a crucial part in convincing the Nigerian government to join the Open Government Partnership, a multilateral initiative to promote transparency and stamp out corruption.  [28]BudgIT seeks to encourage states and local governments to become more transparent with their budgets. It believes that specific legislation, such as the Fiscal Responsibility Act, anchors public finance, must be improved to ensure greater transparency and accountability. BudgIT has begun to engage the National Assembly committees on the sections of the law that inhibit transparency.To tackle apathy among citizens, BudgIT collaborates with local civil society organizations (CSOs) in extensive training on budget comprehension. Augmented with printed graphics in local languages and town-hall meetings, BudgIT has successfully distributed over 150,000 copies of simplified budget documents in 16 states. Tracka directly led to the completion of over 80 community projects.  BudgIT intends to create a database for primary health care centers in Nigeria to coordinate funding (personnel, equipment, and organization) for effective management and operations.  [29]Analysis and Lessons LearnedThe Standard Innovation Review describes BudgIT as “a civic organization driven to make the Nigerian budget and public data more understandable and accessible across every literacy span. BudgIT indeed provided several supports to scale our work in the last one year.”  [30]BudgIT is recognized for its efforts in tracking government expenditure by identifying fiscal irregularities and the mismanagement of funds” in public office. The United States Institute of Peace described BudgIT’s activities as an “investigative or exposé-style research into budgets, spending, and other state policies that shock [people] with what the facts are.”  [31]    However, in 2019, the appointment of Seun Onigbinde, co-founder of BudgIT as Technical Adviser at the Ministry of Budget and National Planning generated missed reactions and negative press for BudgIT with some critics describing his appointment a contradiction to the non-partisan stance of BudgIT.  [32]While BudgIT’s technological approach is commendable, a significant hurdle in BudgIT’s activities is the extent of visibility in Nigeria due to the high level of illiteracy in areas concentrated by the voting population and limited access to digital amenities.However, BudgIT’s activities    led Forbes to recognize it as one of the top five African startups to watch in 2013.  [33]As a community leader on Twitter commented in 2018: “Thank you, Tracka, these are the kinds of things we would not have known without you, and now you have brought all of us together to fight this corruption.”  [34]References[1]  Oluseun Olugbinde, “Destination Democracy via Tech: BudgIT as A Case Study,”  Africa Policy  Review, April 2020,http://digital.africapolicyreview.com/destination-democracy-via-technology-budgit-as-a-case-study/  .[2]“Nigeria’s Inept National Assembly, Most Expensive In The World,”The Nigerian Voice,June 2 2010,https://www.thenigerianvoice.com/news/25769/nigerias-inept-national-assembly-most-expensive-in-the-wor.html  .[3]“What We Do,” BudgIT, accessed July 16, 2021,https://yourbudgit.com/[4]“Who We Are”BudgIT, accessed July 16, 2021,https://cchubnigeria.com/[5]Interview with Abel Akeni, Head, Research and Advocacy, BudgIT, Lagos, Nigeria, on 7th July, 2021.[6]  BudgIT,  States of States 2020Revised Edition, 5.[7]Interview with Abel Akeni, Head, Research and Advocacy, BudgIT, Lagos, Nigeria, on 28th August, 2021.[8]Interview, Abel Akeni.[9]Interview, Abel Akeni.[10]Omidyar Network,  https://omidyar.com/news/omidyar-network-supports-fiscal-transparency-in-nigeria-with-grant-to-budgit/[11]“Our Partners So Far,” BudgIT, accessed July 21, 2021,https://yourbudgit.com/[12]“Community Driven Development,”Participedia,https://participedia.net/method/7413[13]“Community Based Monitoring,”  Participedia,  https://participedia.net/method/5042[14]  “About Us,”  ,” BudgIT, accessed July 24, 2021,https://yourbudgit.com/about-us/[15]Interview, Abel Akeni.[16]Oluseun Olugbinde, “Destination Democracy via Tech: BudgIT as A Case Study,”  Africa Policy  Review, April 2020,http://digital.africapolicyreview.com/destination-democracy-via-technology-budgit-as-a-case-study/[17]  “About Us,”  ,” BudgIT, accessed July 24, 2021,https://yourbudgit.com/about-us/[18]Iyanuoluwa Fatoba, “Tracka Empowers 24 Community-Based Groups In the Oil-producing States on Budget Advocacy, Project Tracking and Service Delivery,” May 14, 2021,  Medium  https://medium.com/@BudgITng/tracka-empthe-owers-24-community-based-groups-in-oil-producing-states-on-budget-advocacy-project-d8ab9830beae  [19]  “Budgeted Spending,” CovidTrackaFund, accessed July 24, 2021,  https://civichive.org/covidtracka/#/spending/budgetedspending[20]Omolabake Fasogbon“BudgIT Reviews COVID-19 Fund Management in New Report,”April 24, 2021,  This Day,  https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2021/04/24/budgit-reviews-covid-19-fund-management-in-new-report/[21]Samuel Itodo and David O’Regan, “Nigeria’s Movement for Transparency and Accountability,” USIP Special Report 433, October 2018,https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/2018-10/sr433-nigerias-movement-for-transparency-and-accountability-bringing-the-pieces-together.pdf  ,ISBN: 978-1-60127-743-5,10.[22]  “ Analysis of the Petroleum Industry Governance Bill,” BudgIT, May 2017,www.yourbudgit.com/wp-content /uploads/2017/05/Petroleum-Industry-Governance-Bill-INFOGRAPHICS.pdf[23]Abiola Afolabi, “Going forward, Looking Beyond: A Reflection on BudgIT’s Expansion II,”  Medium @BudgITNg  November 20, 2020,  https://medium.com/@BudgITng/going-forward-looking-beyond-a-reflection-on-budgits-expansion-ii-c593668df1f4[24]Interview, Abel Akeni.[25]Interview, Abel Akeni.[26]  “Tracka,”  https://tracka.ng/#/home  .[27]  “About Us,”  ,” BudgIT, accessed July 6, 2021,https://yourbudgit.com/about-us/  [28]Jennifer Guay, “Nigeria Holds Public Servants Accountable With Budget Watchdog,”Apolitical,March 6, 2017,https://apolitical.co/solution-articles/en/nigeria-holds-public-servants-accountable-budget-watchdog[29]Interview, Abel Akeni.[30]“About PLSI,”  PLSI Annual Report 2016/17:Agitation, Innovation and Orchestration,  3.[31]Samuel Itodo and David O’Regan, “Nigeria’s Movement for Transparency and Accountability,” 6.[32]Wale Odunsi, “Seun Onigbinde: Reactions as BudgIT Co-founder Joins Buhari’s Government, Deactivates Twitter Account,”Daily Post Nigeria,September 13, 2019,  https://dailypost.ng/2019/09/13/seun-onigbinde-reactions-budgit-co-founder-joins-buhari-govt-deactivates-twitter-account[33]Omidyar Network,  https://omidyar.com/news/omidyar-network-supports-fiscal-transparency-in-nigeria-with-grant-to-budgit/  [34]Tolu Olarewaju, Ibrahim Rufai and Samanthika Gallage, “E-transparency And Government Budgetary Corruption: A Social Marketing And Transformation Case From Nigeria”  Wiley,  December 15, 2020,  https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/isd2.12167  , 10.

This can be traced to the extent of corruption prevalent in Nigeria’s public space.  [1]As a result, there is a limited number of youths actively involved in governance. Accountability Lab, Nigeria seeks to combat corruption by promoting acts of integrity visible in Nigeria and offers a beam of hope to disgruntled citizens.Its vision is a country in which resources are used wisely, decisions benefit everyone fairly, and people lead secure lives. This is illustrated in AL Nigeria's three mutually-reinforcing objectives: to support a positive movement in fostering accountability and democracy; ensure the voices of communities are heard on accountability issues; and support collaboration around accountability and open governance through unlikely networks.Origins and DevelopmentAccountability Lab is described as a “global trans-local network” boasts of twelve network labs, four program partners, 104 staff, and a budget of four million dollars.  [2]   Established in Nepal in 2012, it has carved a niche for itself as a trans-local network rather than an international civic organization geared towards tackling corruption challenges through the implementation of creative solutions.  In January 2017, Accountability Lab, Nigeria (AL Nigeria) was inaugurated as one of the network labs of Accountability Lab. Mr. Odeh Friday’s (Country Director, AL Nigeria) desire to instill change and development through implementing change-oriented policies precipitated the establishment of Accountability Lab, Nigeria. In 2017, after an intensive recruitment exercise, Mr. Odeh Friday was bestowed with setting the groundwork for an Accountability Lab branch in Nigeria with the mission “to make governance work for people through supporting active citizens, responsible leaders, and accountable institutions.” [3]  There is a need to instill hope in youth on the prospects of good governance and accountability in Nigeria’s public space. In the formative years, with headquarters in Abuja, the Board and staff capacity of Accountability Lab Nigeria comprised friends and family with a common goal of attaining set objectives rather than involvement based on qualification or experience.  [4]   However, it is pertinent to note that Accountability Lab, Nigeria, has evolved in personnel, policies, and activities.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingThe richness of the staff and Board of directors has played a vital role in the effective administration of the organization and the level of achievements recorded. The Board of Directors includes Dr. Joe Abah (Country Director), Dr. Yemi Kale (Chairman), Mr. Odeh Friday (Secretary), Miss. Lola Aladesanmi (Board Member), Miss. Enene Ejembi (Board Member), Miss. Gloria Ekpo (Board Member), Miss. Saadatu Falila Hamu (Board Member), and Miss. Beverley Hatcher-Mbu (Board Member).  [5]  The staff is led by Odeh Friday (Country Director), Grace Okpara (Finance and Admin Manager), Prince Chukwuma (Communication Lead), Ehi Idakwo (Programs and Learning Manager), Mnenga Shiiwua (Project Officer), and Kelly Osuji (Project Officer).Currently, there are fifteen full-time staff and twenty-five volunteers. The availability of volunteers nationwide is need-based depending on the project(s) being handled. During project execution, state volunteers are recruited with stipends to ensure task completion. In fostering youth development and advancement, there is the availability of interns who are corps members following National Youth Service Corps obligations (a mandatory one-year training for Nigerian graduates).  [6]     To foster youth inclusivity, there is room for collaboration and volunteering opportunities accessible on its website. This is carried out in various forms: pro-bono services, co-hosting events, writing guest blogs, accountability ambassador, in-kind, and cash donations. [7]  Employment opportunities and internship placements are also advertised on its official website. All staff, volunteers, interns are guided by the core value of integrity, innovation, humility, practicality, and collaboration. AL Nigeria has benefitted from the pedigree of its global office in fostering partnership and grants, particularly its relationship with the MacArthur Foundation. In 2019, Ford Foundation supported with $55,000 to kickstart the achievement of set objectives. Also, there was a partnership with the Government of the Netherlands, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Canadian Embassy, Luminate, National Endowment for Democracy, and VOICE (linked to OXFAM). Accountability Lab engages in training and consultancy for civic-society organizations setting up in Nigeria.  Regarding local funding, Accountability Lab, Nigeria has reached out to possible donors based on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSO). It is still in the negotiation stage with a caveat of a transparent engagement. However, funding remains one of the challenges faced by Accountability Lab despite financial support from Accountability Lab (global office), probably due to its immense activities. [8]   Specializations, Methods and ToolsUsing Community-driven development (CDD) programs aimed at improving “transparency, participation, accountability, and enhance local capacity,”  [9]  AL Nigeria adopts methods and tools based on a three-prong approach: Value-Shifting campaigns; training and collaborative spaces; and eco-building. These approaches entail positive campaigns within and outside government, equipping changemakers with necessary tools, skills, and knowledge, and promotion of collaborative initiatives, respectively. [10]  Accountability Lab adopts creative means of passing positive messages such as music, radio engagement, community outreach, consortium involvement, town hall meetings, trainings, coalition building, social media engagement, and multi-stakeholder dialogues.  Major Projects and EventsAccountability Lab, Nigeria has engaged in a series of projects promoting positive actions and attitudes towards good governance and transparency. These projects include Integrity icons, Accountability Incubator, Voice2Rep (Voice To Represent), Peace and Social Cohesion Innovation Challenge, Civic Action Teams (formerly Citizen Helpdesks), and SDG16.  [11]The uniqueness of Accountability Lab’s approach in Integrity Icons is to encourage people to tell positive stories rather than emphasize the negative information of corruption prevalent in Nigeria’s public sector. Launched in October 2017 with the support of the Ford Foundation, the Integrity Icons project aims to reward and foster conversations on integrity among the citizens and government in Nigeria. This is a global campaign that cuts across various sectors nationwide. According to Accountability Lab, “we want to move away from ‘naming and shaming’ corrupt leaders and towards ‘naming and faming’ those bureaucrats that are working with integrity”  [12]The criteria for nomination include: the individual must be a public servant, at least five years from retirement, and open to interviews.  [13]  The selection process for the Integrity Icons award entails submission of entries through nomination by Nigeria citizens and volunteers, hosting public forums and awareness on the importance of integrity in public service, background checks on the nominees by the ICPC, retired civil servants, and other independent judges from the private sector, CSOs, and the media; leading to the selection of five shortlisted candidates to receive an Integrity Icon award yearly. That is, “people who do things the right way and ensure we have services delivered to citizens in the right way without cutting corners or without corrupt practices,” particularly at local levels.  [14]The volunteers’ nominations are based on tips or field investigations of prospective nominees.  Consequently, the finalists are filmed, the episodes are shown on national television, played on the radio for a week, and posted on official social media accounts to create a national discussion offline and online. Citizens can vote for their favorites through SMS short-codes and the website-  https://integrityicon.org. The winners are crowned in a national ceremony in Abuja. [15]  The Integrity Icons for 2020 include Faith Momoh (a Nurse and Nutrition officer at a Local Government (LGA) secretariat in Ugwolawo Kogi state), Dr. Abiola Jimoh (Divisional Officer for the Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps, in Badagry, Lagos), Phillip Ezegbulam (Chief Secretary of the Police Service Commission in Nigeria), Dr. Mohammed Rabiu (a lecturer at Nassarawa State University) and Oyeronke Suebat(Deputy Provost, the College of Health and Technology in Lagos, Nigeria). [16] Founded in 2018, Accountability Incubator  , funded by the MacArthur Foundation, focuses on youth engagement and empowerment to inspire the implementation of accountability initiatives in various communities. Interested applicants who meet the criteria apply via Accountability Lab’s official website. Selected candidates engage in training (quarterly meet-ups and online modules), hands-on mentorship (support for the development of ideas), communications support (such as promo videos and blogs), networks (through pitch events and “friendraisers”), and other resources (an innovation fund). [17]  In 2020, “Accountapreneurs” (Accountability Incubator participants) were selected with a focus on empowering youths with interests in the extractive, education, and health sectors. Similarly, the SDG16 initiative, with support from the Canadian government, organizes youth-oriented national competitions focusing on developing approaches and formulating innovative ideas proffering solutions to SDG16 related problems. This is in accordance with the United Nations Development Programme to achieve Goal 16 of the Sustainable Development Goals on peace, justice, and strong institutions. One representative is selected from twenty states, and a winner is determined based on the peace-innovation idea presented for future implementation. The finalists present their initiatives at a three-day workshop organized by AL Nigeria, where three winners are selected. The winners are awarded laptops, networking opportunities, and spots in Accountability Incubator for one year to refine and develop their ideas. ( Accountability Lab, “SDG16 Innovation Challenge,” https://accountabilitylab.org/our-work/sdg-16-innovation-challenge/ ). Some of the peace innovation ideas implemented include the Abuja Photo Festival and Hope Behind Bars in 2017. [18]The tools deployed by AL Nigeria have resulted in positive changes in various sectors across the country. Notably, the Voice2Rep initiative sponsored by Luminate and the Government of the Netherlands engages young people through music. It connects to audiences using accountability-themed songs to foster the use of music to promote transparency. According to Friday Odeh, “it is an axiom that music is a universal language, and there is no better time than now to encourage young talent to lend their voices to social activism through their art now that the Nigerian music industry has transcended beyond our borders.”  [19]For instance, in the 2018/2019 edition, an album was released featuring all the artists involved in the competition titled  In These Present Times and available on all major streaming platforms, including iTunes and Amazon. The finalists go through professional training and mentoring programs, culminating in a national concert where a winner is voted. Although no prize money is involved, the winning songs are professionally produced and circulated nationally and internationally. [20] On August 26, 2021, a 13-album listening party was held, which “highlights the violation of human rights while uplifting the resilient spirit of citizens and promoting citizen’s collective responsibility in nation-building.” [21] To promote inclusivity in Nigeria, AL Nigeria initiated a project aimed at the government’s allocation of at least ten percent of Nigeria’s employment slots and provision of accessible building facilities for persons with disabilities. This entailed advocating for a Disability Act as Nigeria is one of the countries yet to implement policies that include accessible-inclined buildings and agenda. According to activist Grace Joy, “if we say that we are promoting accountability, we should not forget those who are living with disabilities.”  [22]    In 2020, the COVID’19 lockdown and restrictions was a source of worry for AL Nigeria based on the inability and difficulty in meeting basic needs faced by persons living with disabilities in Nigeria. [23]  As a member of Civil Society Coalition on Audit in Nigeria (CSCAN), AL Nigeria seeks to promote initiatives that tackle corrupt practices in Nigeria and improvement in increasing the political participation of person living with disabilities. This entails the inclusion of all citizens (tribe, religion, ability, and gender). In 2019, Nigeria signed the Disability Act to improve accessibility by those facing disability. In 2019, the Civic Action Teams was launched as a pioneering citizen feedback, dialogue, and community voice platform to ensure accountability in the development process. They collect critical information from communities and individuals, solving daily problems for citizens and closing the loop on challenges affecting the populace.  [24]Current ProjectsAsides from the annual implementation of projects discussed, Accountabilitea Show, a radio program aired on local radio stations, is a recent addition to AL Nigeria’s initiatives. The radio stations include Darling 107.3 FM at 1-2 pm on Fridays (Imo State), Comfort 95.1 FM at 1-2 pm on Fridays (Akwa-Ibom State), and KU 92.7 FM at 10 am on Thursdays (Edo State). Also,   some Integrity Icons and AL Nigeria’s activities are featured on Accountabilitea podcast (Accountability Lab global office’s podcast) to reach a global audience. AL Nigeria strives to “make governance work by supporting active citizens, responsible leaders, and accountable institutions while building capacity and enhancing knowledge within young changemakers.” [25]Analysis and Lessons LearnedIt is essential to note that all country stations share one website (a global website). This makes it quite challenging to isolate the activities and identify the achievements of Accountability Lab, Nigeria. Perhaps, the country stations should have individual website account while maintaining their global collaboration and presence on the global website. Also, the number of activities engaged in shows that more volunteers are needed to improve efficacy and reach. However, AL Nigeria continues in its goal of “ending impunity within government by building accountability and improving decision-making processes through citizen engagement and inclusion.”  [26]  According to Wilson Atumeyi, one of the beneficiaries of AL Nigeria’s initiatives, “the incubator program has availed me with several opportunities that have moved me from stage A to stage B…I know after the program there will be more room for opportunities.”  [27]  References     [1]Vincent Ufuoma,    “ICPC Pledges To Sustain New Ethics, Integrity In Fight Against Corruption,”    March 18, 2021,  ICIR,https://www.icirnigeria.org/icpc-pledges-to-sustain-new-ethics-integrity-in-fight-against-corruption/.

This organization uses a videoconferencing platform called the Exchange Portal to conduct their programming which brings young adults in post-secondary and professional institutions into facilitated synchronous discussions of current events. These programs can be integrated into existing postsecondary curriculums and enrolled in by individuals seeking professional and personal development.  Soliya’s offerings provide the space for small groups of individuals from different countries to share their perspectives and gain a better understanding of other cultures and views with the goal of eliminating “the idea of ‘the other’ so that we can thrive in this 21st Century society.” [1] The programs also aim to teach conflict resolution strategies and refine participants’ critical thinking skills. Soliya, therefore, provides opportunity for the development of personal and professional skills.Vision: “A pluralistic world where diversity is embraced and conflicts are transformed into opportunities for collaboration and collective learning.”Mission:  “To prepare rising generations to approach differences constructively and lead with empathy, in order to thrive in an interconnected world.”[1]  Origins and Development  Soliya, Inc. was incorporated as a not-for-profit corporation with its headquarters in New York City, U.S., in July 2002 and publicly launched in 2003.[2] Lucas Welch and Liza Chambers co-founded the organization as they grew increasingly concerned about a lack of constructive dialogue between people of Western and Muslim majority countries after 9/11. Welch and Chambers sought to use developing digital and communications spaces to foster meaningful, critical, and empathetic dialogue.  The organization developed a custom videoconferencing platform to foster such dialogue, called the  Exchange Portal . This website was designed to allow individuals to connect online in ways that mimicked face-to-face small group settings.  In October 2009, Soliya partnered with the  United Nations Alliance of Civilizations .[3] In 2011, Soliya formed the Exchange 2.0 Coalition with  Global Nomads Group  and the  International Education and Resource Network (iEARN-USA) . This partnership, later known as the  Virtual Exchange Coalition , allowed Soliya to better provide cross-cultural experiences within their programs.[4]  In 2014, Soliya merged with  Search for Common Ground , an organization focused on using dialogue, media, and community building to foster sustainable peacebuilding. Through this merger, Soliya’s virtual exchange programs continue to be implemented under the name Soliya and using the same Soliya staff team, however, they operate under the direction and with the support of Search for Common Ground.[5]  Currently, Soliya seeks to foster dialogue around the world but remains focused on cultivating constructive and cooperative dialogue between youth in Western and Muslim communities.[6]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Soliya is run by a Board of Directors, a team of over thirty staff members, and a vast network of volunteer facilitators, trainers, and fellows.  As of 2021, the Board of Directors consists of six members (click  here  for Board member bios) appointed by Search for Common Ground.[7] CEO Waidehi Gokhale leads the team of staff members which includes directors, coordinators, and officers for each program offered by the organization, as well as multiple roles in information technology, partnerships and outreach, operations and administration, and specialist roles in media and design (click  here  for brief bios on each staff member). As part of the organization’s work, Soliya also trains facilitators and fellows to assist in leading their programs as facilitators and moderators.[8]  In addition to Soliya’s strategic alliance with Search for Common Ground discussed above, Soliya is also partnered with Stevens Initiative, Global Affairs Canada, Erasmus+ Virtual Exchange, UN-Habitat, Open Road Alliance, Annenburg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylaniva, Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences Social Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, and UCL Jill Dando Institute of Security and Crime Science.[9] To implement their cross-cultural dialogue approach, Soliya is also partnered with more than 280 postsecondary institutions around the world (click  here  for a complete list of partnered postsecondary institutions).  Soliya has an enrollment rate of approximately 15,000 individuals per year in their programs. Postsecondary institutions offering existing related program curriculums are able to request that their school be a part of the Connect and First Year Connect programs. Individuals can apply to the free Social Circles program.[10]  This organization is registered as a public charity and, therefore, receivesmost of their funding from government grants and public support. In 2019, Soliya received $690,010 in government grants and $550,627 in the form of other institutional grants and gifts or donations.[11]  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Soliya’s work is based on developing and fostering Virtual Exchange (VE) opportunities. Virtual Exchange, also known as telecollaboration, uses technology to support face-to-face education programs focused on sustaining constructive dialogue across national borders and cultures. VE experiences are structured and facilitated to ensure critical reflection, understanding, and empathy is fostered within the discussions.[12]  Soliya was considered a pioneer of early VE development and, along with their partners in the Virtual Exchange Coalition, they were one of the first initiatives to use the term Virtual Exchange. Soliya’s involvement in VE is considered to be a service-provider approach.[13] Using developing web conferencing technology, Soliya created their own platform called the Exchange Portal to conduct VE programs and create the opportunity for postsecondary institutions to outsource their VE needs. This videoconferencing platform continues to be refined as web conferencing technology has developed. The Exchange Portal was designed using VE and conflict resolution best practices. The platform situates participant videos in a circle on the screen to resemble a round table discussion. It only allows a maximum of 24 participants per meeting to ensure participants can see all screens to interpret body language. During each meeting, the platform only allows one person to unmute their microphone at a time to eliminate the possibility of interrupting another participant.[14]  Major Projects and Events  Soliya’s work is centred around their four main virtual exchange-related programs offered throughout the year. They also provide opportunities for custom program development and project support, as requested.Connect is a 4 to 8-week program that can be integrated into existing postsecondary course curriculums to support instructors in providing opportunities for students to engage in facilitated, cross-cultural dialogue outside of the classroom. Led by 1 to 2 facilitators trained within Soliya’s programs, participants in the program engage in weekly online discussions with up to 10 other students from various universities around the world. No more than 2 students from each class are in a discussion group together to promote more global connections and ensure a greater diversity of perspectives in each meeting. Participants are encouraged to share their perspectives and opinions during these sessions with facilitators present to ensure the discussions remain respectful and to encourage critical thinking. This program has been implemented in university-level courses such as those in media studies, international relations, religious studies, business, and engineering.There are three offerings within the Connect Program. Connect Global is an 8-week program uses discussions of current events to foster communication skills and empathetic reception to differing perspectives. Connect Collaborate is a 5-week program is focused on teambuilding in an online environment using a current event topic to which students must apply practical lessons. Connect Express is a 4-week program that centres its discussions around the role of identity in global societal divisions.[15]  First Year Connect is a 4-week program with a similar approach and offering to the Connect program, however, with a focus on local community building within postsecondary campuses in the United States. Soliya saw a need for bridging the growing divisions in the U.S. and saw their program model that has been used on a global scale as potentially being useful in creating spaces for American students to discuss differences in a facilitated environment with the emphasis on respectful and constructive dialogue. The goal of the First Year Connect program is to instill these practices of respectful dialogue in first-year university students so that they can continue to implement such practices throughout their campus experiences, thereby fostering a more understanding and engaged student body. This program involves 2-hour weekly synchronous sessions on the Exchange Portal during which students discuss current events and topics of relevance to their campus environment in a group of no more than 10 participants led by a trained facilitator.[16]  The Global Circles program offers individuals 18 years of age or older an opportunity to engage in constructive dialogue on controversial subjects that are of global importance and impact. The program requires participants to attend to 2 online meetings on the Exchange Portal during which they engage in discussion activities led by facilitators and complete individual assignments throughout the two-week session, culminating in a certificate of completion. Topics addressed in the 2021 sessions include vaccination safety, access, and ethics; freedom of speech and its limits; and do we trust science?[17]  The Facilitation Training program engages professionals and new participants to practice conflict resolution skills that are valuable in facilitating Soliya’s virtual exchange programs as well as for problem-solving and mediating needs more broadly. Soliya offers synchronous and asynchronous facilitation training options, as well as Arabic-language training modules. During the trainings, participants engage in virtual discussions, complete readings and assignments, and practice facilitation with certified facilitation coaches. After completion of the full training program, participants receive a UN-Habitat certificate for the Advanced Facilitation Training and PracticumAnalysis and Lessons Learned  Soliya sought to evaluate their global and educational impact through multi-year evaluations in collaboration with the Saxelab Social Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; the Annenberg School of Communication, University of Pennsylvania; Oxford Centre for the Study of Intergroup Conflict, University of Oxford; and University College London.

[1] It is a network of leaders from all population groups and sectors of Israeli society, in collaboration with Atudot Le'Israel, that builds trust among decision-makers and creates changes and multi-sector solutions for citizens and systems in four core areas: local governance, health, education, and employment [2]. MAOZ operates under four core basic assumptions: [3]The promotion of socio-economic resilience is a complex challenge which requires multi-sectoral and systemic collaboration, as well as determined leadership that promotes real-world solutions.  Socio-economic resilience and trust are inter-related  Trust is the infrastructure for promoting cross-system collaboration and solutions, and its absence creates siloed work that hinders the potential for change.  It is possible to increase trust by increasing one's awareness of the other through their stories, driving diversity, improving professionalism and ethics, and by promoting a concept of shared responsibility. These are the principles of mamlachtiut promoted by MAOZ.  Actions that increase trust between leaders and decision-makers will echoto additional circles in the Israeli society and serve as a basis for cooperation and solutions in reality.In addition, MAOZ has four major organizational goals it hopes to reach by 2024: [4]To develop a trust-based network of 800 members with a shared language and high levels of trust who advance socio-economic resilience through ongoing learning, trust-promoting practices &amp; collaborations. MAOZ seeks to have 70% of network members be “influential, diverse and have high social capital”.  To strengthen the capacities of 200 Network members’ organizations and increase effectiveness via trust-promoting structures, work methods and practices.  To promote changes in reality through 200 Network members’ organizations.  To spread trust through 10,000 socio-economic field officials who are exposed to and who regularly utilize trust-related knowledge and ideas.Origins and Development  MAOZ was co-founded in 2010 by current board members Jeffrey Swartz and Doron Latzer and by Dr. yair Schindel and Yotam Dagan on the principle that the socio-economic resilience of Israel depends largely upon the quality of its leaders.[5] In 2010, MAOZ’s founders envisioned a network of values-driven leaders working together on tangible initiatives to transform the Israeli public sphere. Today, MAOZ develops and networks change-makers to confront the fragmented nature of Israeli society; the lack of social cohesion across sectors and populations; the absence of long-term planning; and insufficient talent pipelines to produce high-quality and principled leaders. With close to 200 in the MAOZ Network as of 2021, the impact of MAOZ is increasingly visible in areas such as health, education, employment and more.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingOrganizational StructureMAOZ is an Israel-based organization with a global network extending primarily into the United States and Europe. The organization comprises of a leadership group, a board of directors, and the general membership who take part in MAOZ’s pedagogical and networking initiatives. [6]MembershipMAOZ seeks to recruit “diverse, high-caliber candidates who have the potential to lead socio-economic change in Israel”.[7] Members are admitted based on the merit of their Hebrew-language application form into one of four training programs: [8]The MAOZ Fellows Program: prepares and networks mid-level and senior officials and focuses on the issue of employment.  The Amber Program: a joint venture with the ministry of health which focuses on the training of a managerial reserve in all areas of the health system.  The Ripple Program: a joint venture with the ministry of education which focuses on the training of leadership reserves for the senior level in the education system.  The Place Plan: a joint venture with the ministry of the interior which focuses on the training of leadership reserves for the senior echelon in the local space.FundingMAOZ’s annual budget has grown extensively since their 2015 from $3.1 million USD to $13.8 million USD in 2019. [9] Approximately 80% of MAOZ’s funding is from American, Israeli, and foreign philanthropy, while another 20% comes from the Israeli government.[10] MAOZ further specifies the origins of their income sources, with 40% derived from Israel and 60% coming from overseas donors. MAOZ receives 30% of its funding from individuals, 45% from foundations, 23% from the Israeli government, and 2% from participation fees for events and training programs. [11] Furthermore, MAOZ stipulates that no single investor, individual, or foundation is permitted to invest more than 20% of the annual budget in order to maintain transparency, accountability, and diversity. [12]. MAOZ provides a highly specific breakdown of expenditures on their  website .  Specializations, Methods and Tools  MAOZ has a strong focus on education and trust-based networking to give members skills and opportunities which will maximize their impact in the public sphere. For example, the MAOZ Fellows program comprises of seven weeks of intensive learning spread throughout the year, including one week at Harvard Business School in the USA. It uses an “on the job” training format such that fellows can continue working while participating in the program, allowing them to immediately apply their new knowledge and skills to real-world situations. MAOZ Fellows also uses peer learning and shared consultation regarding challenges faced by the fellows in their professional positions. [13]  The MAKOM municipal leadership pipeline program also comprises of 7 dispersed weeks of study including one at Harvard Business School and the “on the job” training format. [14] It also teaches on the public sphere at the community, municipal, national and international level, emphasising economic development and a “residents at the centre” approach. Furthermore, it provides the opportunity to network with government officials, business leaders and other experts in the public and private sectors. MAKOM also has a “dedicated accelerator program” that provides professional tools, resources, and expert consultation to accelerate change-process projects.[15]  The INBAR Healthcare management program develops personal leadership capabilities, addresses Israel’s socio-economic challenges and their impact on the nation’s healthcare system, and builds on MAOZ’s group network. It also allows participants to receive an MBA with a specialization in Health Systems Management at Tel Aviv University Business school, a 6 semester program specifically built for INBAR fellows. Lastly, it provides members with professional management training for managerial roles in healthcare. [16]  The AVDOT leadership pipeline for the Israeli education system, in addition to offering the same 7 week program and “training on the job” format at MAOZ Fellows and MAKOM, facilitates peer networking and learning to advance MAOZ members within the education sector. [17]  Major Projects and Events  MAOZ has four major programs and joint ventures: Maoz Fellows, INBAR healthcare management program, MAKOM municipal leadership pipeline program, and ADVOT leadership pipeline for the Israeli education system. [18] In cooperation with the Atudot Le’Israel Division in the Prime Minister’s Office, MAOZ is working to implement the Atudot Le’Israel government resolution – a strategic plan for building a leadership pipeline for the public sphere in Israel. In this framework MAOZ operates Joint Ventures, with relevant government ministries, in MAOZ strategic focus areas: Inbar (with the Ministry of Health), ADVOT (with the Ministry of Education) MAKOM (with the Ministry of Interior) and the MAOZ Employment Venture (a partnership with the Labor and Social Welfare Department).[19]  The initiatives are designed to promote systemic change by creating a common language around the core challenges of the various systems, increasing the trust among the top players across areas of influence, developing leaders’ professionally, and creating a network of leaders that drive significant change processes collaboratively. The members of the programs represent diverse populations and employment sector in Israel including private, NGO, public, municipal and communications.  Throughout the year, there are interactions among the members of the various programs aimed at advancing mamlachti (common good) actions for the benefit of Israel’s economic and social resilience.  Upon completion of the programs, the members join MAOZ and Atudot Le’Israel’s Network, which is a multi-disciplinary and diverse multi-sectoral network, which is a space for leading and accelerating economic and social change initiatives and changes in the country. [20]  The MAOZ Fellows program is an employment joint venture that trains and connects valued, professional and mamlachti (common-good behaviors and actions) senior leaders. The program focuses on identifying fellows from the field of employment that come from the social, governmental, municipal, private and media sectors and represent the diverse population groups acroass the Israeli society  The training is based on meaningful learning and constant synergy among theory, reality, and experience in an effort to create lasting change in the field of employment. By working on leaders’ self-identity and values, and by receiving professional tools, the leaders are able to address the burning internal social and economic challenges of Israel and strengthen its socio-economic resilience. [21]  The MAKOM municipal leadership pipeline program is a joint venture of the Ministry of the Interior and MAOZ, and a part of the government resolution, “Atudot Le’Israel” – striving to build a tri-sector management pipeline for Israel’s local government sphere. The joint venture identifies, trains, and networks leaders and accelerates initiatives of senior positions in the local government system, civil society, private sector, and central government with the goal of fostering a generation of mamlachti (common good) leaders capable of and effective at leading change in the local sphere.[22]  The INBAR Healthcare management program is a joint venture with the Ministry of Health, which strives to develop and nurture excelling and values-based doctors in order to create a leadership pipeline focused on the better good in the healthcare system. The program is supported by the Ministry of Finance, the Civil Service Commission, Israeli HMOs and the Prime Minister’s Office. [23]  Lastly, AVDOT leadership pipeline for the Israeli education system is a joint venture between the Ministry of Education and MAOZ, whose goal is to create a management pipeline for tri-sector professionals across Israel’s education system. The program endeavors to create a shared language around the education system’s core challenges, to increase trust between senior and diverse players in the system’s various focus points of influence, develop existing leaders within the educational system and create a network of change-making leaders that collaborate to create meaningful change. [24]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  As MAOZ trains professionals, experts, and those engaged in civic society, their impact has the potential to be quite diverse and experienced across a number of sectors. The organization has continued to see consistent growth in membership and donations, indicating its networking and promotional ventures have been successful. In 2018 the network grew to 323 members and was expected to reach 474 by the end of 2019. [25] Furthermore, during 2018 MAOZ supported 40 “social change processes” and 17 more projects were provided with “additional leverage”. [26]  In 2017-2018, with the aim to create widespread impact, MAOZ, in partnership with the Israeli government scaled its model to benefit strategic areas within the public sphere (i.e. education, health, municipal government, and employment). In 2018, MAOZ Fellows - a program for tri-sector leaders had 42 fellows in its 8 th  cohort, MAKOM- a joint venture with Israel's Ministry of the Interior for middle and senior officials in local government had 62 fellows in its 2 nd  Cohort, ADVOT- a joint venture with Israel's Ministry of Education for executives across Israel’s education system had 32 fellows in its 2 nd  Cohort, INBAR - a joint venture with Israel's Ministry of Health to develop the next leaders of the healthcare industry had 31 fellows in its 3 rd  &amp; 4 th  cohort. [27]  Furthermore, MAOZ drives leading research to guide strategic growth and help their Network Members and organization integrate data-based decision making. The Center also creates case studies and research for Network Members and Accelerator fellows on different issues in MAOZ's four core activity areas. In 2018, MAOZ's Knowledge Center carried out research and produced a total of 43 papers on a range of subjects from advancing Arab employees to managerial positions in the private sector to best practices for digital literacy interventions for young Arab and ultra-Orthodox populations.

[1] It works to ensure that victims receive support – social, economic, physical/mental, and political – and create a space for the voices of members in a deliberative process so that their demands drive the organization’s campaigns, positions, and activities. The KSG works with other civic and community organizations to develop capacity for advocacy support in regional, national and international contexts.  Origins and Development  The apartheid system in South Africa, based on the Afrikaaner principle of separateness, systematically classified people into distinct racial categories with corresponding rights and privileges. From 1948 to 1994, the apartheid system violently restricted Africans to overcrowded reserves and specific spheres of economic activity. All Africans not involved in the mining economy were displaced to reserves outside of white urban centers. Under apartheid, many people suffered mental and physical trauma, poverty exacerbated by the loss of family members or destroyed homes,and the inability to access education, social services, or basic support. With the success of the African National Congress under Nelson Mandela and his calls for non-violence and reconciliation, the National Unity and Reconciliation Act was passed in 1995 and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) commenced. With Archbishop Desmond Tutu acting as Chairman, the hearings started in 1996.  The KSG was founded in 1995 by a group of survivors of apartheid human rights violations to provide support and assistance to people testifying before the TRC. The KSG has since expanded to cover a broad range of advocacy, campaigns, coalition-building, and interdisciplinary mixed-method approaches to assist those affected by apartheid and to hold the South African government accountable to its TRC reparation commitments.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The KSG's membership is over one hundred thousand and is composed of survivors and family members of victims of gross human rights violations under apartheid. Khulumani’s membership continues to climb because of the impact and scope of the apartheid system and its legacy.  Khulumani is governed by a Board of Trustees comprising persons elected by Khulumani’s National Steering Committee at the Annual General Meeting. The Khulumani Board is in the process of establishing an Advisory Support Group with specific expertise related to Khulumani’s core issues. The National Steering Committee oversees the development and support of Khulumani’s community-based membership. [2]  Khulumani’s National Contact Centre, now based in Pretoria, serves as the coordinating center of the organization and the point of access to the organization for the general public. Its management is the responsibility of the National Director assisted by the Finance and Human Resources Officer and the Member Liaison Officer.  The National Steering Committee comprises three representatives from each of the Provincial Steering Committees and meets as far as possible every six months to inform the work of the organization through cooperative planning and to advise the Board. The office-bearers of the National Steering Committee assist with Board with all planning and decision-making of Khulumani member groups.  The Provincial Steering Committees comprise representatives from different districts within each province and provide leadership on strategic issues affecting their regions of the country.  For a list of members and further information about the governance and management structure, consult:  https://khulumani.net/about-us/#governance-structureSpecializations, Methods, and Tools  The Khulumani Support Group specializes in using advocacy networks, creative interdisciplinary mediums, and a variety of support and campaign tools to support Khulumani members. The organizational work and mixed-methods approach of the KSG are centered on 5 principles: [3]To secure acknowledgment of what happened to victims through ongoing truth-recovery processes. Khulumani uses narrative, ‘art and memory.’ and oral history to document these histories and to produce publications, installations, and exhibitions.To support the collective struggle for social justice to fully realize the achievement of the TRC’s recommendations for rehabilitation and community reparations, and to promote an environment that supports the rule of law, that provides equal access to justice for all citizens and that promotes a culture of accountability. Khulumani pioneered outreach to its members to build capacity in access to and the use of information through the Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA) to try to hold government at local and national levels accountable. Khulumani members have used their information-gathering skills to develop dossiers of information on the cases of the forcibly disappeared to advance the right to have all cases of the ‘disappeared’ investigated by the National Prosecuting Authority. Khulumani members have developed considerable competence in taking forward advocacy on the human rights issues that affect the members of their local communities.To work for the economic reintegration of victims and survivors through the development of livelihood activities in partnership with various agencies. The Khulumani framework for member enterprises is linked to activities that meet the social and economic rights contained in the Bill of Rights, such as the right to food, water, and sanitation, quality education, a safe and healthy environment, housing, and access to quality health care.To facilitate youth participation in social justice issues. Khulumani has a Forum Theatre group of young people who create pieces about problems and issues in the community as a tool for community participation in problem-solving. Khulumani has facilitated processes to reintegrate former combatants through skills building in computer literacy, oral history techniques, and community-based research into the practices of companies in different sectors.To promote justice and reconciliation globally through knowledge exchanges and visits to victims’ groups in countries in the African region and to international meetings where processes for achieving justice and the empowerment of the victims are explored.Coalition building is also a central method for Khulumani advocacy.  Major Projects and Events  The KSG was a key member in the formation of the South African Coalition for Transitional Justice, which was established in 2011 with the aim of holding the government responsible for its reparation and policy commitments emanating from the TRC. [4] In addition to the KSG, this coalition also involved other South African civil society organizations: the Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation, the International Centre for Transitional Justice, the SA History Archives, the Human Rights Media Centre, the Institute for Justice and Reconciliation, the Freedom of Expression Institute and the Trauma Centre for Victims of Torture and Trauma.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Khulumani’s Apartheid Reparations Database contains the biographies of both those who were harmed and those who participated in the struggle against apartheid. The database has informed Khulumani’s litigation against multinational companies, charging them with aiding and abetting the perpetration of gross human rights violations.

Promote civic conversations as a habit that values ​​our differences and allows us to connect to each other around them.  Systematize, represent and respond rigorously to the vision of the future of Chilean society.Origins and Development  Chile faced one of its major social and political crises during October 2019, in response to a rise in the Santiago Metro's subway fare. A series of massive demonstrations and severe riots originated in Santiago and spread to all regions of Chile, opening a national debate about the role of violence, corruption and inequality. Although the riots escalated, it also did citizen meetings and spontaneous civic dialoges all over the country. We realized there was an opportunity from that crisis. People were anxious to express their opinions and hear different ones.In this context, the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and the University of Chiledecided to collaborate and open the resources, facilities and knowledge to promote a massive conversation beyond its campus.Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  This initiative is jointly led by the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile (PUC) and the University of Chile (UCh), which are the largest, oldest and most prestigious institutions of higher education in the country.  Specializations, Methods and ToolsSince 2020, we offered online opportunities for citizen participation and civic conversation crystalized under two participation schemes: online surveys and digital conversations through video calls.Online surveys: Participants could log their responses, ideas, proposals and opinions in 17-themed surveys from education, health, gender and inclusion, to the economy, the State and others. The surveys contained not only qualitative questions to be answered through open-ended written responses, but they also featured cases: the surveys ended with three to four cases, all of them inspired by real-life events. Participants had to read them and answer with open-ended, free-writing sentences after going through an empathy exercise. More than 95,000 surveys were recorded during 2020, containing beyond 600,000 responses.Digital conversations through video calls: Participants could choose to set a time and date for a real-time, two-hour-long conversation with 5 other people across the country through Zoom. This conversation was guided by a moderator and followed a dialogue methodology created by the Public Innovation Laboratory at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. Participants themselves would share how they’ve felt in the past months, agree to talk on several issues and end up concluding several ideas, together, in order to bridge differences and converge. More than 12.000 participants were part of this mechanism from across all 346 communes in Chile, including prison inmates, and individuals living in isolated and rural communities throughout the country.Analysis and Lessons Learned  The Latin American region share similar social, political and economical challenges that need to be faced collectively. That is why in 2021 Tenemos que Hablar de Chile shared the experience, methodologies and lessons with universities in Colombia. Six universities from different regions of the country have been working together on the Colombian version of Tenemos que Hablar.",3,1,2,4,0,

The purpose of the not-for-profit organization is to spark new ways of imagining and working together to fuel and create social change. Co-founders Annie O’Donoghue and Julia Grady stated, “Our goal is for the Guelph and surrounding community to know 10C as a place where information can be found and shared, where people can gather, and someplace great workshops and interesting forums are hosted.”  Origins and Development  10C Shared Space was launched in 2008 by Annie O’Donoghue and Julia Grady in Guelph, Ontario. The first 10C location was opened at 10 Carden Street in Guelph after Annie and Julia identified a need for a coworking and collaboration space in the community. They noticed a common problem among grassroot organizations and entrepreneurs: many were working on similar projects or setting similar goals without realizing. By creating a shared workspace, such organizations would be able to work together and collaborate in organic and exciting ways.  Since 2008, 10C has expanded from its initial space to a new, larger location at 42 Carden Street. It has become a part of numerous social finance and sustainable development projects and partnerships, and a hub for a diverse range of gatherings. Currently, there are about 200 members of 10C, with an average (pre-COVID-19) annual attendance at community events and workshops.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The organizational structure of 10C Shared Space consists of a community of members, an elected Board of Directors, staff team, volunteers and organizational partners and collaborators.  10C has a variety of membership types available for community members:StudentIndividualOrganizationNourishVentureNourish + OrganizationFunding  10C’s operating budget is derived from multiple sources, such as annual membership fees, coworking and space booking fees, federal, provincial, municipal and community grants, as well as donations and community bonds.  The City of Guelph and University of Guelph are two of the most consistent and longest-standing partners of 10C, alongside many other organizations and individuals in the Guelph-Wellington area.  Specializations, Methods and Tools10C Shared Space focuses on placemaking, community engagement, social enterprise, social finance, sustainable food systems, and the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (including goals #17 - Partnerships for the Goals, #9 - Industry Innovation and Infrastructure, and #10 - Reduced Inequalities). The organization strives for these priorities through a variety of projects and initiatives:Nurturing the membershipActivating spaces for allModeling sustainable practicesRunning, supporting or catalyzing projectsCoaching and mentoringActing as a learning hubNetworking, connecting, convening and engagingImagining and leveraging investment in a visionary wayHelping people see and find solutionsActing as a home for community-based researchMajor Projects and Events  In addition to community events like workshops and forums, 10C Shared Space has initiated two major social finance projects. The first is the organization’s Community Bonds Project. Through community bonds - a debt financing tool - 10C takes out loans from community members and invests in the infrastructure of the shared space.  10C’s second notable social finance project is their Harvest Impact Fund. This project builds upon the 10C social finance journey, to provide friendly lending in the form of loans and mentorship to businesses and nonprofits looking to make positive social change. Harvest Impact seeks to use social financing as a tool to create meaningful opportunities in the community that increase social, political, and economic agency for all. Harvest Impact strives to better understand the unique experiences of those whom they work with and the systemic barriers they face when attempting to access funding and business supports.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Establishing a space like 10C in Guelph posed many challenges. The founders and staff members had no prior models to follow or similar organizations to consult. As such, Co-founder and Executive Director Julia Grady explains, “[we] want[ed] 10C to not only be a blueprint for other individuals and organizations, but also for us to be mentors to future change makers. Our hope is to become a sort of community concierge for change makers.”  Despite challenges faced, 10C has grown tremendously with the support of the Guelph community. As it continues to grow in members, projects and initiatives, the organization’s leadership has learned that growth takes time. 10C Shared Space is now working at supporting other organizations wishing to make a similar impact in their communities.

Women and girls faced extreme poverty and oppression, living as property in a male-dominated society and rarely seen or heard by the outside world. In response, Canadian Women for Women in Afghanistan (CW4WAfghan) was established in 1996 by Canadians dedicated to enhancing the well-being of Afghan women and girls. CW4WAfghan is a nonprofit organization with thirteen volunteer chapters throughout Canada, and it is a federally registered charity that is non-religious and non-political. Canadians and Afghan women have been working together to improve human rights, end women's oppression, and provide opportunities for Afghan women to live with dignity and purpose. Both parties believe that education is the key to true peace in Afghanistan. The CW4WA is dedicated to advancing education and opportunities for Afghan women and their families while also educating Canadians about human rights in Afghanistan. They aim to create sustainable education programs and engage Canadians as global citizens. [i] [4][i]  CW4WAfgahnistan, Annual Report. (2013). Pp;4:  https://cw4wafghan.ca/governance/Origins and DevelopmentBack in 1996, writer Deborah Ellis  was actively striving to draw attention to the dire situation of Afghan women following the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan. Ellis established a casual organization known as Women for Women in Afghanistan. Later that year, Janice Eisenhauer and Carolyn crossed paths while pursuing their degrees in International Development at the University of Calgary, Reicher from Calgary. After learning about Afghan women's human rights violations under the Taliban regime, a group of Canadian women felt compelled to help tangibly and effectively. They met with Deb Ellis in Toronto in 1998 and began organizing. Janice and Carolyn led the effort, eventually growing into a national organization called Canadian Women for Women in Afghanistan (CW4WA).  Meanwhile, Deb travelled to refugee camps in Pakistan and Russia to meet Afghan women and girls and wrote stories about her experiences. She returned with inspiring stories and a crucial guiding principle: ""Listen to the voices of Afghan women. “Sally Armstrong's journalism, including her groundbreaking 1997 article in Homemakers magazine, brought attention to the human rights crisis faced by Afghan women and girls. During her travels, she visited Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. In 1998, co-founder Janice Eisenhauer signed CW4WAfghan's first by-laws. Armstrong also wrote two books,  Veiled Threat  and  Bitter Roots and Tender Shoots , which shed light on Afghan women's difficulties while fighting for their rights.  CW4WAfghan is a thriving organization comprising various members, including individual volunteers, local chapters, donors, supporters, and two staff teams in Canada and Kabul. Together, they work toward the common goal of promoting human rights for Afghan women by providing them with greater access to education and life-changing opportunities.  Deborah Ellis is a renowned author who has written several award-winning young-adult novels, including  The Breadwinner Trilogy  and  ""My Name is Parvana ."" The stories revolve around the lives of eleven-year-old Parvana and her friend Shauzia, who live in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, and depict the strength, courage, and hope of children who struggle to survive war, poverty, and oppression. Deborah has generously donated all royalties from her books to CW4WAfghan, resulting in over $2 million in grants for education initiatives for Afghan women and girls. Thanks to the contributions of numerous individual donors, hundreds of projects have been initiated to benefit women in Afghanistan, amounting to millions of dollars. Many years ago, Canadians asked, ""What can We do?"" and took action to fight for the fundamental rights of Afghan women and girls. By listening to them, Canadians were able to respond with solidarity and ensure that these rights were not only written on paper but  also practiced in real life. Remember, ""Human rights are universal,"" and ""we can work together to uphold them'.Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The CW4WAfghan is a registered charity in Canada (Canada Revenue Agency #887718203RR0001) and a nonprofit corporation registered with Industry Canada under #415380-4. It is authorized to operate under the Alberta Government Charities Act (#309874).  In 1998, CW4WAfghan became a nonprofit corporation in May 2003 and a registered charity in February 2009. The organization is governed by a Board of Directors of at least three elected Officer positions and up to six additional Directors, per the organization's CRA-approved by-laws. The officers include the National President, National Vice President, National Secretary, and National Treasurer. Directors and officers are nominated and elected by voting members at annual general meetings. [i] [1]  The CW4WA is funded by the Canadian government as well as donations.[i]  Candian Women for Women in Afghanistan. Official Website:  https://cw4wafghan.ca/governance/Specializations, Methods and Tools  CW4WAfghan has a detailed set of policies and procedures that govern various aspects of the organization's operations, including program implementation, financial accountability, and human resource management. The Afghan Republic government legally recognized the organization, and it is a registered charity in good standing with Canada Revenue Agency. It undergoes an annual audit of its Canadian records to ensure compliance with regulations governing charities. These policies and procedures provide that the organization operates transparently and with integrity. Additionally, it has an extensive project review and approval process that evaluates proposals, competitive RFPs, budgets, and required narrative and financial reporting. It conducts site visits to verify that operations align with field reports. Their performance measurement system regularly collects pertinent data from funded services. It enforces policies and guidelines for projects its partners implement and a procurement policy for goods and services. The organization uses legally binding contracts. Their travel directive policy is implemented, and they have a zero-tolerance anti-corruption policy. The CW4WA policies offer guidelines for implementing projects, contracts, and reporting templates. It also establishes clear expectations for financial accountability to ensure efficient project management when working with other organizations. All expenses are reviewed and verified through proper documentation.  Major Projects and Events  Investments in Basic Education: At CW4WAfghan, it believes that having the right to education goes beyond simply having access to school. It also means having access to quality education. While Afghanistan has made significant progress in increasing the number of schools, teachers, and students from 2002 to 2021, there were still significant challenges regarding the quality of education. That is why it has been Investing in Basic Education Program focuses on improving the quality of education by training teachers and providing them with more resources through various projects such as The Lantern Fund 2025, The Gender Equity in Teacher Training to Improve Girls' Education (GETT) Project, Getting Girls Back to School, School and Library Starter Kits, School Support, and Accessible Storybooks for Children. Through the Learning Baskets initiative, it continued to develop and distribute local language reading materials and more for Afghan children and their families. To ensure that even those displaced or living in remote areas could access education, It offered virtual learning opportunities through initiatives like DD Classroom and DD Courses.  Additionally, it provided professional development to displaced school leaders and teachers. It aimed to enhance free and open resources like the Darakht-e Danesh Digital Library. It made education more accessible to all Afghan children, youth, and adults in Afghanistan and beyond. [i] [2]  Technology for Education: The organization believes technology can be a powerful tool to help people exercise their right to education. Everyone should have access to education, and their Technology for Education Program provides innovative tools to help Afghan citizens gain knowledge and skills essential for the 21st century. The program's virtual education tools, collectively known as Knowledge Tree or Darakht-e Danesh in Dari, enable thousands of people in Afghanistan and nearby regions to access education.  The FTZ School in Kabul was a local community school that served school-age girls in grades 1-10. The school operated in two shifts and had a budget of $106,000 for 2018; the school had a safe building and classrooms, trained teachers who received ongoing professional development, after-school program instructors, learning resources, school notebooks, pencils, fuel for heat in winter, a growing library, a modern computer lab, a playground, and a learning garden. CW4WAfghan's quality assurance staff also supported the school administration in improving the quality of learning. Furthermore, experienced teachers were connected with junior or new teachers through a unique coaching and mentoring component, and a performance measurement framework has been developed to track progress and identify areas needing improvement. In March 2019, nine girls advanced to the new Grade 11 class, and 368 female students were enrolled. The school employs 16 teachers in the morning and afternoon shifts, and seven teachers provide after-school instruction. Thanks to the Rotary Clubs of Kabul and Germany, the school kitchen has been updated, including a much-needed water purifier.  The Wakhan Initiative for Literacy, Education &amp; Development (WILED) was created to address the need for better education in the remote area of Badakhshan province. The Better Business Society, in response to a request from local activists, collaborated with CW4WAfghan to assess the situation and find ways to help. The project aimed to improve the quality of life and increase the capacity for managing and delivering quality education in Wakhan. The local implementing partner, SALEH, is funded by the Better Business Society and its partner donors. The project included basic literacy classes for women and men and upcoming activities such as life skills, librarianship, and reading mentorship in 2019.  Serving a Broad Community: Learning to read as an adult differs from how children learn to read, as adults must develop automaticity, fluency, and comprehension. It is challenging for adults to achieve a reading speed of at least 45 words per minute. It is similar to a literate person trying to learn a new script, like an English speaker trying to learn Cyrillic. Adults struggle to adjust to recognizing and retaining unknown letters, which is more complicated than children who have brains that are more adaptable to learning new languages and scripts.  Adult Literacy: CW4WAfghan has used a unique approach to teaching adult literacy based on Dr. Helen Abadzi's perceptual learning method. Dr. Abadzi, a cognitive psychologist, uses evidence from neuroscience to understand how adults learn reading, and her method has been tested in multiple languages and script combinations in different countries. In 2019, CW4WAfghan tested the technique for the first time in Afghanistan under Dr. Abadzi's guidance and achieved consistently better results than other methods. The approach emphasized repeated practice to gain automaticity, and teachers were trained to guide students in literacy classrooms.  In 2018, the CW4WAfghan Community Literacy Classes and Libraries (AR!) The budget was $39,300. This program aimed to support the development of literacy skills among adult women and out-of-school girls in small Afghan village communities. The classes were held in the homes of local women who received a small stipend for hosting and were taught by trained local teachers. The program also provided access to a growing collection of books, life skills training, and hygiene kits. Each class offered basic literacy classes for approximately 25 female students for one year. The project successfully registered 97 literacy students across three classes in the Karte Naw district of Kabul province. The program's goal was to help reinforce literacy skills, nurture a culture of reading, and foster independent, lifelong learning for illiterate Afghan women with few other learning options.  The Darakht-e Danesh Library (DD Library) had a budget of $67,800 in 2018. It was a digital collection of open educational resources (OERs) for Afghan classrooms. The resources included lesson plans, pedagogical tools, exercises, experiments, reading texts, workbooks, curricula, and other materials. Both primary and secondary teachers could access over 3,500 resources in more than 350 subject categories in Dari, Pashto, and English. The library aimed to increase access to quality, locally adapted educational resources, encourage teachers to consult various information sources and support teachers in adapting, creating, and sharing their resources with others. The library had users from all 34 provinces of Afghanistan and over 20 different countries. In 2018, the library added 568 new resources, bringing the total to over 3,500 resources in seven languages, including Dari, Pashto, English, Nooristani, Uzbeki, Swaji, and Munji.  In the budget for 2018, CW4WAfghan allocated $27,000 towards grants for Implementing Partner Organizations and scholarships for students. CW4WAfghan has a long history of working with trusted partners to achieve their goals in critical areas. These grants provided flexible funding to meet unique project needs. Examples of contributions included PARSA's Sisters 4 Sisters (S4S) program, which offered mentorship and personalized attention to at-risk women and girls, the Afghan Children's Songbook project, which aimed to design, produce and print the first edition of Bood Nabood, Traditional Afghan Children's Folktales, Hoopoe Books, which sought to fund the translation, printing and distribution of 3000 Pashai Pashto edition of a children's storybook for Pashai speaking children in Afghanistan, and the Shafia Fund, established in memory of the three young Shafia sisters and their aunt from Kingston, ON, with funds given as scholarships to female students for study.  Afghanistan Policy Dialogue, Amplifying Afghan Women's Voices: The Afghanistan Policy Dialogue Program (APDP) was created to address the growing threats to the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan during negotiations with the Taliban in February 2020 when the Doha Agreement was signed. As of August 2021, the program's primary focus has been advocating for restoring education rights for women and girls in Afghanistan, ensuring their safe passage out of the country, and evacuating those at risk. The APDP also emphasizes the importance of Afghan women's voices, views, and experiences by amplifying the voices of women activists on Canadian and international platforms in hopes that their demands will be recognized and met. To stay updated on how the CW4WA can help Afghan women, check out the CW4WA Advocacy Page. It provides letter-writing templates, social media posts, and other resources to engage its members, partners, and chapter networks in spreading the message of Afghan women's demands. Additionally, it offers an Advocacy Toolkit, hosts events and campaigns, and provides up-to-date information. The organization also helps Afghan women's networks and activists reach policy-makers and collaborates with like-minded organizations in Canada and globally.  Public Engagement: CW4WAfghan members promote social justice and women's rights in Afghanistan and beyond. They strive to raise awareness and funds to support Afghan women and girls through various activities. Their efforts reflect a commitment to global citizenship and solidarity in creating positive change.  Grants and Scholarships: The CW4WA Grants and Scholarships program promotes education by supporting partners and individuals making a positive impact. The program has three main components: The Shafia Fund, which provides scholarships to Afghan women pursuing higher education and facing financial hardships; Remote Communications Assistance, which supplies devices and internet connectivity for virtual learning; and Small Grants, which provides funding for partner organizations in Afghanistan whose projects align with its objectives. Additionally, the program awards the annual Champion for Education in Afghanistan Award to recognize exceptional individuals, projects, programs, and organizations that have made significant contributions to supporting education for girls and women in Afghanistan.  Supporting At-Risk Afghans: The events of August 2021 caused turmoil in Afghanistan, leading millions of Afghans to leave their country. Many more are expected to follow suit in the coming months and years. [ii]  [5]  CW4WAfghan was established in 1998. Since then, It has trained over 10,000 teachers, provided literacy classes for almost 5,000 students, distributed nearly 300 school library starter kits, established 40 community libraries and 262 science labs, and shared numerous resources through our Darakht-e Danesh Digital Library.

Official Website:  https://cw4wafghan.ca/[ii]  CW4WAfgahnistan, Annual Report. (2018). Pp;7–12: https://cw4wafghan.ca/governance/  Analysis and Lessons Learned  To improve literacy skills, it is important to practice reading consistently. Encouraging a love for reading can enhance literacy culture. The CW4WA literacy classes provide classroom libraries with books in the local language and for all levels, and they believe literacy should be integrated into learners' lives outside of school. To achieve this, CW4CA provides access to relevant materials, such as the life skills curriculum, which is incorporated into the literacy program for their students. ""I learned more about teaching methods and techniques. Thanks to this training, our capacity is built up, and our knowledge is increased."" One program participant said.  Literacy teacher trainee: Acquiring foundational literacy skills through literacy classes can pave the way for formal education for both men and women. For this reason, literacy classes must be designed with a purposeful structure that promotes a smooth transition into regular school. The AR! project utilized a tool called the Personal Learning Plan to achieve this goal. Moreover, literacy skills have an intergenerational impact. Research indicates that literate mothers raise literate daughters. To foster this link between parental literacy and support for children's education, the project included strategies that encouraged women to read to their children.  Having a private space like a library is crucial for women to interact with other women, share ideas, and gain independence. Community involvement is essential for CW4WAfghan's library projects, as they only open libraries when communities invite them and have no significant security concerns. Cost-sharing is also encouraged to promote community ownership, where the community contributes to the library and literacy centre space. Additionally, the project focused on providing mentorship, training, and monitoring to teachers to promote reading and library usage through hands-on pedagogy and exposure visits to libraries. [i] [3]  It is sad to mention that Afghanistan's education system has experienced a significant setback despite 20 years of dedicated efforts to improve it. This is due to the Taliban's return to power on August 15, 2021. Unfortunately, the Taliban has prohibited Afghan women and girls from pursuing education and work, causing a devastating blow. Consequently, Afghan women are currently living under the same restrictions as they did in 1996.[i]  Candian Women for Women in Afghanistan. Official Website:  https://cw4wafghan.ca/literacy/Publications  In 2021, CW4WAfgahnistan printed and distributed 15,810 storybooks and provided 234 mental health books to students. They also translated 220 storybooks and had 18 media interviews or articles published by staff. These details were included in their annual report, found on pages.

Specifically, their focus is on creating safe spaces for children to read. Additionally, they have been actively involved in providing humanitarian relief and assistance in Afghanistan since 2003.  Access to education is a fundamental human right, and the Constitution of Afghanistan (2004) ensures this right for all citizens. Over the years, the number of girls enrolled in primary schools has risen from zero (0) in 2001 to 2.8 million in 2018. External funding has significantly impacted education spending, accounting for approximately 49% in 2020. Nevertheless, while there has been notable progress, specific challenges remain concerning access, learning, and outcomes. Recent research indicates a need for early learning opportunities, enhancing the qualifications of teaching staff and providing better-quality learning experiences. [i] [1], lack of school buildings and library Facilities, Long-term Conflict, Poverty, child marriage, and forced marriage prevented them from getting full access to free education or ensuring adequate learning quality.  According to research, in 2015, there were approximately 18000 schools in Afghanistan, but only 10 percent had a school library. The project's goal was to improve the quality of education by promoting library activities in elementary schools and public libraries in Afghanistan.

This project has been ongoing in Afghanistan since 2013, with the support of MoIC.[i]  Shantee Volunteer Association website:  https://sva.or.jp/english/activity/afghanistan/#activityOrganizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Since SVA was established, it has worked as an international Organization to create a culture of learning among targeted countries collaborating for essential support that differs from place to place to social circumstances. Countries that SVA has worked with include: Afghanistan, Nepal,Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Thai, Burma Refugee Camp (Myanmar) Japan.  SVA has two types of funding resources:The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan (MoFA) and Japan Platform (JPF) have provided government funding sources.  Private funding sources include companies, associations, and individuals through donations.Specializations, Methods, and ToolsSVA has worked with the Afghan government to carry out projects in distant and rural regions of Afghanistan. These projects aimed to provide humanitarian support to locals who have not received such assistance before.  The Children's Library projects in Afghanistan have been implemented in these central provinces: (Nangahar, Kabul, Konar, Bamiyan, Balkh, and Heart).  Targeted Population:  The project provides access Library to public and private primary schools for students in first through sixth grade. Additionally, children of various ages and perspectives have benefited from the public and private libraries involved in the project. Teachers, library staff, ministries staff, and focal points are also involved.  Major Projects and EventsHere is an example of SVA efforts and library activities:On February 13, 2017, SVA held a “ Library Skills training program ” workshop in Bamiyan, made possible by funding from the International Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA). ADRA is a well-known international humanitarian organization that operates in over 107 countries, focusing on health, education, livelihood, and emergency relief. SVA implemented the program in the ADRA regional office in Bamiyan response efforts. [i]  [4]  In this project, SVA's role was limited to conducting the workshop, while ADRA took charge of funding, organizing, selecting participants, evaluating, and reporting. This project marked SVA's first experience with a partnership program for the children's library project in Bamiyan, which involved collaborating with other international organizations, including ADRA in Afghanistan.  This project targeted Zarin and Kart-e-Sulh schools, encompassing a diverse range of participants in age, gender, educational background, and profession. The group comprised 33 individuals, including teachers, trainers, principals, and three administrative employees.  from ADRA. The workshop's objective was to encourage library activities for children in Bamiyan, and it was conducted using a Q&amp;A format. Practical exercises were also implemented to facilitate comprehension and individual development. After the workshop, ADRA awarded participants with a Certificate of Completion following workshop evaluation.Workshops Agenda : It was designed to continue for three days, and it was focused on the following topics:Day 1Introduction to SVA activities,  The need to create libraries for Children,  Why are picture books and legends chosen for children?  Types of libraries,  Storytelling and its benefits,  Teamwork (Question &amp; Answer),  Value of images in legendary texts,  The procedure of reading stories in comic books,  Story reading practice,  Advantages of using school libraries,  On verification and games for children,  Prepare ground crafts for children in the library averment.  Teamwork (Questions &amp; Answers)Day 2A brief overview of the first-day topics,  Methods of reading skills progress in Afghanistan,  Capabilities and life skills,  Children and Psychology,  Positive and negative effects of this phenomenon in schools, families, and society,  Teamwork (Questions &amp; Answers)  The overall conclusion and knowledge exchange.  What type of employee should be hired at the Children's Library?  The main principles for librarians,  General duties of a librarian,  Telling stories through mental games,  Teamwork (Questions &amp; Answers)  Storytelling by handcraft.Day 3A brief overview of the second day,  The unique feature of the librarians,  Borrowing Books from the Escrow system,  Methods of using the Library,  Exploring the influence of storytelling on children's mental development.  Teamwork (Questions &amp; Answers,  Paper's theatre and practice,  Processing of making paper theatre books,  Using the library assessment forms,  Storytelling practice &amp; Use of the paper theatre box,  Teamwork and overall conclusion of the workshop.During the program, Sultana Safi, the trainer from SVA Library, thoroughly explained the concept and ensured that the participants comprehensively understood the materials. Safi emphasized the importance of the Children's Library in enhancing children's learning skills and how to cater to their needs. Furthermore, the librarian must undergo training on handling and treating them. During her presentation, Sultana emphasized the importance of developing storytelling skills and allowed volunteer participants to practice these skills in a mental game format in front of the class. She also addressed the significant correlation between Psychology and Children, explaining that understanding children's behaviour and capacity for learning knowledge and consciousness is critical. Sultana  highlighted the usefulness of paper theatre as a tool for children's learning, noting that it helps them quickly and memorably grasp concepts through pictures and colours.  Following each session, the trainer grouped the class into smaller teams to encourage collaboration. The participants brainstormed their ideas, developed concepts, and committed to supporting each other. The class policy emphasized open discussion, allowing everyone to share their experiences and stories freely. Overall, the exchange of ideas was encouraged and valued.  Bamiyan's lack of a school library posed a challenge for children and experts trying to establish a stable library system. However, following a workshop, evaluations revealed that most participants recognized the importance of libraries for children in enhancing the quality of education for those in school and those without access to libraries.  The program had 33 participants, 13 of whom were female and 20 were male. Some school principals were essential in sharing their ideas and making decisions. Meanwhile, the class was divided into five groups, and each group presented their ideas and opinions about how storytelling can benefit children.  Upon completion of the program, theParticipants made the following commitments:  To support the process and its goals  To encourage children in families, schools, and society to visit the children's Library and improve their skills.  To recognize the vital role of children's libraries and their positive impact on learning  Many of them requested story picture books, which SVA later provided.  They also requested establishing a children's library section inside the Bamiyan public library.  Established Library in 16 schools that had no library and provided and recruited a librarian for Kart-e-Sulh school,  They Requested to conduct more workshops and seminars in this regard.  [ii] [3]Balkh Province:  SVA's primary objectives in Mazar-e-Sharif City, Balkh province, were to create libraries for children and provide the necessary equipment. After discussing with the Library Director and holding various meetings, SVA sent their team on October 18, 2016, to address the requirements. They successfully established a library at Balkh public building and reserved a designated room. The technical team from SVA was responsible for installation and decoration. Following this, a three-day workshop was conducted for the Mawlana Khasta public library librarians on September 25, 2016.  Three days' workshop agenda was included:Primary Responsibilities of Children Librarian and Criteria,  Children's Library and Methods of Use,  Storytelling through handcrafts and Picture books impacts quality learning.The Library was officially established during an inauguration party on September 30, 2016. The library director gave the opening speech, welcoming guests and committing to supporting the initiative. Regional and international media, such as Ashna TV Broadcasting Channel in the USA and Balkh Regional Radio/TV reporters, were invited to cover the event. The board of the Directorate awarded the SVA team an Appreciation Letter as a way of recognizing their efforts.  Herat province:  In 2016, SVA collaborated with the Ministry of Information and Culture to establish a children's Library in Herat's public library building. The team travelled to Herat, installed, and decorated the room, furnished it with quality books and learning materials, and conducted a three-day workshop for the librarians.  Three days' workshop agenda was included:Primary Responsibilities of Children Librarian and specific criteria,  Children's Library and Methods of Use,  Storytelling through handcrafts and Picture books impacts quality learning.  Challenges:  Weak coordination among Afghan stakeholders in this province,  Security concern: A suicide bomber attacked and exploded in the city. Thus, the deadly explosions delayed the process.Due to security concerns, the library was inaugurated without the government authorities and October 13, 2016.

Analysis and Lessons Learned  The key to sustainable development is quality learning. People can gain knowledge and learn together when a society is peaceful and harmonious. SVA has collaborated with other Afghan government agencies to create a platform for Afghans to thrive in a society that is filled with complex issues. Furthermore, the project was intended to embrace diverse values and ideas and encourage dialogue to coexist peacefully with others. [i] [2] Meanwhile, the Children's Library assisted children in improving their reading skills. An enthusiastic librarian must attract children and be comfortable while learning.  [ii] [5]  The importance of the Children's Library cannot be overstated, especially in Afghanistan, where children have been lacking learning resources for many years. Using new and innovative teaching tools can significantly enhance the learning experience. The evaluation report showed that library projects in Mazar, including picture books and paper theatre concepts, significantly impacted children's learning and motivation. Thus, found it fascinating. The library provides a platform for children to have peace of mind, know how to read and write and explore new learning materials to make a bright future.[i]  Shantee Volunteer Association website:  https://sva.or.jp/english/activity/afghanistan/#activity[ii]  Osu Children’s Library Fund:  www.osuchildrenslibraryfund.caPublicationsLibraries beyond Border, Shanti Volunteer Association, 2011.

12416,organization,Disability-Inclusive Climate Action Research Programme,https://participedia.net/organization/12416,The Disability-Inclusive Climate Action Research Programme (DICARP) is a organization based at McGill University that seeks to centre the voices of people with disabilities in the climate movement. DICARP works at the intersection of the disability and climate movements.,0,2023-04-14,2023-06-19,423507,sarah.gillies,https://participedia.net/user/423507,423507,sarah.gillies,https://participedia.net/user/423507,en,,,Montreal,Quebec,,Canada,45.5018869,-73.5673919,higher_ed,,,,informal, research,,facilitate, inform,,disability, climate, abilitydisability,human, environment,,," Mission and PurposeThe Disability-Inclusive Climate Action Research Programme  (DICARP)  aims to bring together scholars and activists from the climate movement and the disability movement to “generate, co-produce, share, and translate knowledge” [1] about respecting and protecting the rights of people with disabilities in climate change action. DICARP was founded in response to the limited amount of research about disability rights and climate change; they realize the gap in knowledge about the unique impacts of climate change on people with disabilities leads to climate action strategies that are inequitable, ineffective, and violate the human rights of people with disabilities [2]. DICARP also recognizes the valuable perspective people with disabilities bring to climate change discussions and aims to ensure its initiatives are led by and accessible to people with disabilities. Furthermore, DICARP approaches climate change with an intersectional lens, which considers the overlapping effect of different forms of oppression, including disability, race, sex, age, queerness, indigeneity, and others [1].InEnabling Commons  , a podcast ( by the McGill Centre for Human Rights and Legal Pluralism)which DICARP shares on its website , DICARP’s director and co-founder, Dr. Sébastien Jodoin, explains DICARP has three main prongs: first, they use the disability rights framework to examine the effects of climate change on people with disabilities; second, they review and influence national and international climate policies in cooperation with other organizations, including the International Disability Alliance (IDA); and third, they centre the voices and knowledge of people with disabilities in climate change conversations [3].A definition of disability-inclusive climate action is helpful in understanding DICARP’s mission. In an opinion piece, Jodoin et al. describe three conditions of disability-inclusive climate action [2]. First, action must be led by scholars, activists, and others with disabilities who have lived experience of ableism and other forms of oppression. Second, climate research must consider and align with the priorities of people with disabilities to avoid violations of their rights. Third, co-produced knowledge must be made accessible to people with disabilities to facilitate their involvement in climate action. Jodoin et al. emphasize that disability-inclusive climate action requires people to recognize the value of diverse forms of knowledge, including lived experience and community-based research. The IDA adds that disability-inclusive climate action ensures the engagement of people with disabilities and disability rights language in climate change education and awareness [4].Knowledge co-production is a critical component of disability-inclusive climate action. Jodoin et al. assert that climate research should be guided by the disability rights movement motto, “Nothing about us without us” [2]. Knowledge co-production can be defined as the creation of knowledge through research and other processes that involve a diverse group of people, perspectives, and experiences [5]. Thus, successful co-production of knowledge is highly participatory. Climate change, in particular, demands knowledge co-production that balances scientific and local knowledge [6].Origins and DevelopmentDICARP was co-founded by Dr. Sébastien Jodoin, associate professor in the Faculty of Law of McGill University and Canada Research Chair in Human Rights, Health, and the Environment [7]. Jodoin had been a human rights and climate change activist, scholar, and lawyer for 15 years, focusing on the role of human rights in compelling governments to reduce their emissions and preventing the disproportionate harm of groups, particularly Indigenous communities, when he was diagnosed with relapsing Multiple Sclerosis and suddenly became a member of the disabled community—a group disproportionately affected by climate change [3]. At the time of his diagnosis, Jodoin was co-editing a book about human rights and climate change, which included a chapter on women’s rights, children’s rights, and Indigenous rights; yet, it failed to mention disability rights. Jodoin was introduced to a major gap in research about disability rights and climate change, as well as limited inclusion of members of the disabled community in the climate movement. He co-founded DICARP, with Dr. Yolanda Muñoz, associate member of the McGill Centre for Human Rights &amp; Legal Pluralism and faculty lecturer at the McGill Institute for Gender, Sexuality and Feminist Studies, in an effort to fill that gap and increase disability inclusion [8].DICARP continues to collaborate with other disability rights organizations to conduct research, publish reports, and create awareness about disability-inclusion in the climate movement. Their actions centre and are led by people with disabilities.Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingDICARP is a collaborative organization led by the Canada Research Chair in Human Rights, Health, and the Environment and  the McGill Centre for Human Rights &amp; Legal Pluralism. It is  based out of McGill University and funded by the McGill Sustainability Systems Initiative and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [1]. DICARP has a core team of investigators and research associates, as well as a larger advisory network/panel.DICARP’s core team includes [7]:Dr. Sébastien Jodoin (director and co-founder): associate professor in the Faculty of Law of McGill University and Canada Research Chair in Human Rights, Health, and the EnvironmentDr. Nandini Ramanujam (co-investigator): associate professor in McGill University’s Faculty of Law and the executive director of the Centre for Human Rights and Legal Pluralism (CHRLP)Dr. Alexis Buettgen (co-investigator): has an academic background in community psychology and critical disability studies and focuses on community-engagementMathieu Simard: PhD candidate in Rehabilitation Sciences at McGill University whose research focuses on disability-inclusive approaches to disaster risk reduction and climate adaptationKatherine Lofts (research associate): member of the Canada Research Chair in Human Rights, Health, and the EnvironmentDICARP’s advisory panel brings together disability and climate activists and scholars from around the world [3]. The diverse panel helps ensure that DICARP’s research is aligned with the experiences and needs of people with disabilities [9, 10].Advisory panel:Francisco Bariffi: Universidad Nacional de Mar del PlataKarina Chupina: International Federation of Hard of Hearing Young PeopleLouise Fournier: GreenpeacePatrick Fugeyrollas: L’Égalité et l’Inclusion des personnes en situation de handicap (INÉÉI–PSH) &amp; Université LavalPratima Gurung: Indigenous Persons with Disabilities Global NetworkCarlos Kaiser: ONG InclusivaMary Keogh: CBM GlobalSelma Khoudiri: L’Égalité et l’Inclusion des personnes en situation de handicap (INÉÉI–PSH)Anna Lawson: University of LeedsSetareki Macanawai: Pacific Disability ForumDianah Msipa: Centre for Human Rights, Umiversity of PretoriaDr. Yolanda Muñoz:  University of McGill  Dr. Yolanda Muñoz is a co-founder of the Disability-Inclusive Climate Action Research Programme  Ipul Powaseu: Papua New Guinea Assembly of Disabled Persons  Shivaun Quinlivan: NUI Galway  Gordon Rattray: European Disability Forum  Marcie Roth: World Institute on DisabilityNkhasi Sefuthi: Lesotho National Federation of Organisations of the Disabled (LNFOD)Jewelles Smith: Council of Canadians with DisabilitiesFatma Wangare: Kenya Association of the Intellectually Handicapped (KAIH)Elham Youssefin: International Disability AllianceSpecializations, Methods and ToolsDICARP conducts research; collaborates with other organizations; shares the latest news about disability-inclusive climate action on their website; organizes educational events to share knowledge; and uses a podcast,Enabling Commons  , to facilitate discussions about disability and climate changes.As Jodoin mentioned in the first episode ofEnabling Commons,DICARP has three main prongs [3]. Each prong involves a variety of methods and tools: The first prong (using the disability rights framework to examine the effects of climate change on people with disabilities) is the focus of DICARP’s research and publications, which is conducted by DICARP’s team and advisory panel, sometimes in collaboration with other climate or disability-focused organizations. The second prong (reviewing and influencing national and international climate policies in cooperation with other organizations) is also achieved through DICARP’s research, reports, and collaboration with other organizations.The third prong (centring the voices and knowledge of people with disabilities in climate change conversations) is particularly achieved through DICARP’s events and theEnabling Commonspodcast. DICARP’s events, including webinars, forums, and side events of the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26, COP14), highlight disability rights in climate change discussions and feature the voices of people with disabilities. TheEnabling Commonspodcast was established to figure people with disabilities as knowers, makers and doers in the climate movement [3]. One of the podcast’s goal is to combat the dominant tendency of academia and media to emphasize the vulnerability of people with disabilities; instead,Enabling Commonshighlights their knowledge and contribution to the climate movement.DICARP ensures its research, reports, and events are accessible to people with disabilities to promote education about the climate among members of the disabled community. Education helps people with disabilities to understand their rights relative to climate change and engage with the climate movement. By ensuring accessibility to informational events and publications, DICARP removes lack of education as a barrier to participation in the climate movement for people with disabilities.Major Projects and EventsDICARP’s most recent projects include:Nothing about us without us: The urgent need for disability-inclusive climate research[3]: an opinion piece that explains the need for disability-inclusive climate action and describes a vital component of this inclusion is thorough, participatory research on the intersections of disability and climate change.Systematic Analysis of Disability Rights in Canadian Climate Policies[11]: a report about the inclusion of disability rights in Canadian climate policies adopted at the federal, provincial, and municipal levels.Disability Rights in National Climate Policies: Status Report[12]: a report (released in collaboration with the IDA) which outlines the obligations of states to protect the rights of people with disabilities under international law; provides an analysis of disability inclusion in states’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs); and makes recommendations for improving disability inclusion in climate actions.DICARP’s most recent events include:Anofficial Side Event at COP26[13]: focused on disability-inclusive climate action and featured eight participants from different organizations pertaining to climate change, human rights, and disability rights.A webinar with the Disability &amp; Philanthropy Forum: discussed the intersections between disability and climate change, as well as philanthropy’s role in community-based solutions, aimming to support members of the disabled community to produce knowledge and bring together disability, climate, and human rights philanthropists and advocates.Disability Futures: an event in collaboration with Sins Invalid (a disability justice organization) and  Movement Generation Justice &amp; Ecology Project (a  climate justice organization) which involved a discussion about climate justice and disability justice, as well as Sins Invalid’s performanceWe Love Like Barnacles  .A 2021 Economic and Social Committee Humanitarian Affairs Segment Side Event: organized byUNICEFandIDA  , which participation from DICARP's advisory panel. Young people with disabilities were involved in a discussion about how people with disabilities can participate in local climate action and how to strengthen their ability to be advocates.More of DICARP’s research, publications, and events can be found on their website.Analysis and Lessons Learned  Despite there being a limited amount of research on the intersection of disability and climate change, existing publications in this space can be used to evaluate the relevance of DICARP's goals and efficacy of their methods.Eco-ableism is discrimination against people with disabilities that is specific to actions and attitudes related to the environment and climate change. Eco-ableism involves and reinforces the assumption that there is a correct form of the human body, which creates rigid concepts of health that pathologize people whose bodies deviate from the accepted norm [14]. Eco-ableism enables the exclusion of people with disabilities from climate discussions and allows able-bodied people to act as leaders, protectors, and saviors for people with disabilities—who are figured as dependent and vulnerable  [14] . Given the prevalence of eco-ablism, DICARP’s goal to re-figure people with disabilities as knowers in the climate space is significant because it prompts people with disabilities to be included and heard in conversations. DICARP emphasizes the importance of co-producing knowledge, which requires the participation of people with disabilities. Sins Invalid, a disability justice organization which DICARP has collaborated with, also highlights the wisdom that people with diverse experiences bring to the climate movement and holds that all bodies, human, animal, and planetary, are valuable [15].The United Nations (UN) released a report that reviews existing data and provides recommendations to promote the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for people with disabilities [16]. In regard to people with disabilities, the report highlights barriers to participation in community life; disproportionate levels of poverty; limited access to education, health services and employment; and underrepresentation in decision-making. The primary barriers that prevent people with disabilities from participating in their communities, according to the UN’s findings, are discrimination, stigma, and lack of accessibility. Regarding discrimination and stigma, DICARP figures people with disabilities as knowers, which helps promote their participation in the climate movement. DICARP also ensures that their events and publications are accessible to promote education.Many of the recommendations in the UN's report align with DICARP’s objectives and methods, although the recommendations in the report are more specific to natural disasters and risk reduction. Some of the UN’s suggested next steps include: ensuring that emergency information is inclusive and available in accessible formats; raising awareness among persons with disabilities on disaster management planning at the local level; enhancing the knowledge of aid workers on the needs and strengths of persons with disabilities; and undertaking evidence-based research about persons with disabilities relevant to conflicts and disasters [16]. These recommendations describe some of the work DICARP is accomplishing in the climate space more generally, rather than specifically in the context of natural disasters.Kett et al. released a report under the Open Society Foundations (the largest private funder of independent groups working on human rights, democratic governance, or justice) following the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP 26) [17]. From their literature review, Kett et al. found very few examples of effective partnerships between the climate movement and disability movement, as well as a lack of research about the specific impacts of climate change on people with disabilities. The report contains recommendations, including improving intersectional understandings of climate and disability issues; developing a rights-based view that connects climate justice and disability rights; increasing disability representation in climate justice networks; conducting more research on the intersection between climate and disability; and supporting disability activists to be leaders and share their knowledge, which align with DICARP's goals. The report recognizes DICARP’s contribution to disability-inclusive climate action and describes DICARP as being “instrumental in bringing together activists and advocates around the climate agenda” (p 32). According to Kett et al., DICARP’s advisory panel is well-comprised and includes “most, if not all, of the key players identified for this research” (p 32). The report also notes DICARP’s successful collaboration with other disability and climate organizations.Larrington-Spencer et al. also note the limited research about climate change and disability rights; furthermore, they explain the disabled body is a killjoy in the climate movement [18]. The climate-related challenges that face people with disabilities highlight inequalities in accessibility. However, in advocating for better accessibility, the disabled community may be seen as trying to draw attention away from mainstream climate concerns. Larrington-Spencer et al. argue there needs to be more space for disability studies scholars in environmental research and policy making. Aligned with DICARP’s mission, Larrington-Spencer et al. assert the disabled body should be centralized in the climate movement; yet, according to Larrington-Spencer et al., academia plays a significant role in the limited presence of disability. Academia insists on a high level of efficiency and productivity, and members of the academic community must be high performing [18]. Cram et al. explain that to participate in academia, people with disabilities must either overcome their disabilities or figure themselves as an exception, rather than changing the norms of productivity [14]. The exclusion of scholars with disabilities from academia is social injustice and a loss to academia: lived experiences and valuable perspectives are overlooked [18]. The exclusion of the disabled community results in a loss of knowledge; Bell et al. argues that disability must be recognized as an ordinary component of the human experience rather than abnormal or exceptional: disability is a spectrum that every person is on [19]. The exclusion of people with disabilities and their experience from academia highlights the importance of DICARP's mission (to frame  people with disabilities as knowers in the climate movement)  and methods (such as publishing scholarly work by disability scholars on their advisory panel).In addition to lacking participation in academia, when the disabled community is mentioned by able-bodied scholars in academic spaces, they are often labeled as a vulnerable group [20]. The assumption that people with disabilities are dependent, vulnerable, and weak further hinders their ability to participate in the climate movement because it diverts attention away from their potential contribution. Kelly-Costello argues people with disabilities are expert adapters: living in a society designed for a particular type of body gives people whose bodies deviate from the norm numerous opportunities to problem solve and adapt [20]. Therefore, the lived experience of people with disabilities is valuable knowledge in the pursuit of climate change solutions.There are multiple arguments for the unique knowledge that people with disabilities can contribute to the climate movement. Besler explains that people with disabilities have experience living with limitation, pain, uncertainty, and change, which is vital knowledge for navigating climate change [21]. Disabled communities have experience in creating support networks and adaptation strategies, which may be helpful in dealing with challenges created by climate change. Eriksen et al. adds that people with disabilities may be more apt to problem solve and embrace diversity; thus, the knowledge of people with disabilities may be helpful to foster resilience [22]. These perspectives provide support for DICARP’s mission by reinforcing the need to centre disabled voices in the climate movement and recognize people with disabilities as knowers.Expanding on the argument that people with disabilities bring valuable knowledge to the climate movement, Belser argues that insights from the disability justice movement, namely the ability to reconfigure how impairment is recognized, can be useful in the climate movement [21]. In society, there is a tendency to make disability invisible; however, in many disabled communities, disability is embraced and claimed as an important part of a person's identity. Similar to disability, environmental damage is often made invisible by powerful institutions. Both disability activists and climate activists struggle with being overlooked by people who are unaffected by disability or climate change respectively [21], although both disability and climate change can affect anyone at any point in life. Belser draws multiple parallels between the disability and climate movements that highlight how disability and climate activists may benefit from working together, which provides support for DICARP’s methods of bringing together scholars and activists from both movements.However, Besler also illuminates deeply ingrained cultural practices which hinder DICARP's work—namely the tendency for people to ignore disability and climate change if they are not directly affected by these issues  [21] . While DICARP's efforts may help the disabled community be more involved in the climate movement, there are many systemic challenges that face the disability justice movement, the climate movement, and the intersection between the two.While the participation of people with disabilities in research and policy-making is a vital component of disability-inclusive climate action, it does not entail their full inclusion in society [23]. Ableism continues to reproduce barriers and inequalities for people with disabilities in society at large  [23] . Lahsen explains that participation is only a component of combating oppression [24]. Participation is necessary to understand the needs of people with disabilities, but it does not, alone, correct power imbalances and economic inequalities. While ending ableism may be beyond the scope of DICARP’s mission, ableism, namely eco-ableism, hinders the inclusion of people with disabilities in the climate movement, which is DICARP's goal. General stereotypes about people with disabilities being less capable may prevent them from being figured as knowers in the climate space. Without having knowledge or being socially recognized as having knowledge, participation in society is challenging [25].Ultimately, there is support for the relevance of DICARP's mission and evidence that suggests their methods are appropriate in the context of their goal as a participatory organization. However, ableism is a persisting form of oppression that acts at systemic and individual levels. While DICARP's mission concerns the climate movement, this space cannot be separated from society as a whole; therefore, it is important to acknowledge the challenges associated with ableism that hinder the participation of people with disabilities in society at large, including the climate movement.

He faced hate speech, discrimination, and violence due to his ethnicity in Rhino Refugee Settlement, Uganda, where he sought refuge.  After finding safety in Koboko and becoming a Christian evangelist, Patrick found a new purpose – to help bridge divides and unite refugee communities for peace, reconciliation, and tolerance. In May 2017, while serving as a full-time Evangelist of Koboko Seventh-Day Adventist Church, he founded the Community Empowerment for Creative Innovation – CECI Uganda, to tackle conflict tensions and ethnic cleavages arising from ethnic discrimination, cultural intolerance, hate speech, resource access and utilization, trauma and limited employment opportunities in refugee communities.  He mobilized a team of refugees who shared his vision of promoting peace and self-reliance in their communities through education, innovation, and recreational activities. They were from diverse ethnicities, professions, and backgrounds, but all were united in their commitment to fighting discrimination and violence.  On August 14, 2017, Patrick, along with Vita Geofrey, Dominic Wani, Baba Michael Nigo, Juma Robert John Paul, and Hakim Bosco, registered CECI Uganda as a Community-Based Organization (Reg. No. 563/124) with the Koboko District Local Government. Later, they incorporated it as a Company Limited by Guarantee (Reg. No. 80020002697777). This milestone marked a new phase of growth and impact for CECI in preventing, reducing, and transforming conflicts through locally-led innovations in peacebuilding, education, livelihood, and environmental sustainability.  Since then, we have been working with 58,524 youth, women and girls to stop violence and increase social cohesion among and between refugees and host communities. We campaigned against all forms of hate speech and incitement to violence and provided community-based and data-driven solutions to the problem of hate speech, disinformation, and misinformation. We have also strengthened local peace structures to respond to and prevent conflicts, rebuilt the livelihoods of 5,951 youth, women and girls, increased their safety and wellbeing, and improved access to education for over 5000 children.  Our focus on empowering youth and women to participate actively in local leadership, peacebuilding, and development has been unwavering. Today, we have expanded our services to benefit 147,098 refugees and hosts in Koboko, Yumbe, and Obongi districts. We are strengthening their participation by increasing access to education, financial resources, knowledge and skills in conflict resolution and peacebuilding, business, technology, entrepreneurship, and vocational training.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  CECI is run by a team of skilled, competent, and experienced personnel headed by an Executive Director who is Secretary to the Board of Directors – a supreme body of the organization after the General Assembly. The Board, consisting of 5 members, is the custodian of all policies, formulates and reviews them and approves them as laws that the management implements in the interest of the organization.

The organization not only supports local artists in creating their works, but also promotes arts education across the wider community. By setting up various educational programs for youth and seniors, Centre[3] creates an inclusive and accessible space where art can drive social change within Hamilton.Origins and DevelopmentBefore its rebranding in 2012, Centre[3] was known as The Print Studio, a space dedicated to providing accessible and affordable printmaking services for Hamilton’s local artists. Between its creation in 2003 and its rebranding in 2012, The Print Studio’s mission evolved from a sole focus on printmaking to encompass community education and art activities. With this shift in priorities came a change in the organization’s name and identity. Thus, in 2012, Centre[3] was born.The studio currently features top-notch traditional printmaking facilities and a high-tech digital media studio. Pieces from emerging and established artists, both local and international, are exhibited in Centre [3]’s main gallery. This studio also has a separate area where exclusive local works are displayed for their members.In addition to their in-studio offerings, Centre[3]’s staff use educational and outreach initiatives to connect with Hamilton Wentworth communities.

Studios and FacilitiesCentre[3] has three studios where members and guests can work independently or alongside a technician to bring their artistic ideas to life.Makerspace &amp; Digital Studio: provides access to traditional print services (archival printing), as well as digital services (archival scanning)Print Studio: offers much of the necessary equipment to do screen printing, t-shirt printing, lithography, intaglio printing, and relief printing.Media Arts Studio: set up to support various media arts projects. Areas of focus include film production, film equipment rental, production &amp; post-production tech support, video enhancement support, and audio booth.iv. WorkshopsCentre[3] routinely hosts workshops for members and guests to participate in where experienced instructors are brought in to teach specialized skills. The skills taught in these workshops range, including but not limited to, various types of printwork, creative writing, and even some skills within the realm of performance arts.Listed below are some of the workshops held by Centre[3]:Critical Art Writing with Saelan Twerdy (December 12, 2022)Podcasting with Rebecca Casalino (November 5, 2022)T-Shirt Printing Workshop (October 5, October 19, November 9, November 23, 2022)v. ProjectsCentre[3] has developed two major projects over the past few years. The first, entitled Stitching a Line Thru Media, was a three-part project that spanned the years 2019-2022, and it involved artists from across North America and Europe. The project focused on ways themes such as nostalgia, identity, and culture can be displayed and discussed through textiles and media art.The project was broken down into three major exhibitions listed below:Year 1: Interweavings (2019)- This exhibit explored themes surrounding the ways in which handmade and mechanized textile production intersect. It also brought together topics such as cultural practice and the widespread impact of technology in our lives.Year 2: Remediations (2021)- This exhibit discussed the development and transformation of technology through textile art. Some artists chose to focus on more contemporary forms of technology, such as e-commerce sites and dating apps, whereas others focused on earlier technological developments, such as the television. Overall, the exhibit discussed how technology is created and designed by those who are impacted by it.Year 3: Transpositions (2022)- This final exhibit of the project exhibited different forms of textile production using elements of technology, such as wires and cords, as the mediums for textile production. In this exhibit, artists communicated using technological materials that hold cultural importance through their chosen medium of textile design.The second major project from Centre[3] is entitled Steal this Poster Exchange 2022. This project originated in Winnipeg at the Martha Street Studio as a marketing strategy and has expanded and been adopted by other art collectives. For Centre[3]’s interpretation, they commission ‘non-partisan protest posters’ that are then hung in various neighborhoods throughout Hamilton, and community members are encouraged to “steal” the posters. This project is a creative take on art dissemination and helps spread the causes and solutions highlighted in the poster artists’ work.vi. Arts ResidenciesThere are four different arts residencies Centre[3] members can apply to.Incite Foundation Residency- 12-week self-directed residency. It gives multidisciplinary artists access to studio time and support to use a variety of different facilities and tools within the centre. The residency ends with an exhibition in the main gallery.Emerging Artist Residency- 12-week self-directed residency. Provides studio time and access to a variety of facilities to artists with under 5 years of exhibition experience.Hamilton-Based Residency- 12-week self-directed residency. Open to all artists in Hamilton, provides access to facilities at the centre. Finishes with an exhibition in a gallery.Centre[3] x Martha Street Studio Residency Exchange- Yearly exchange program with Martha Street Studi in Winnipeg. The artist is sent for two weeks for a residency and access to their studio.vii. SubmissionsArtists can submit their work to multiple shows and galleries at the centre and are also welcome to apply to the above-mentioned residencies.2.Social Practicei.Community artsCentre[3] runs several programs as well that are focused on social impact; however, their four programs of focus are listed and explained in greater detail down below.YouthCAN- Centre[3] and the other involved organizations work to directly support NEET youth by building programming that helps them navigate the job market. Specifically, they provide mentoring and job search training to help NEET youth obtain jobs. This program also provides networking opportunities for participants to meet with hiring companies and peers.360 [4] Youth- This program offers youth ages 15-30 a paid work placement and teaches them digitally-based skills to make them more employable. Skills taught in the workshop include but are not limited to; MS office, social media training, and various soft skills.Direct [Message]- This project is research-based and is aimed at increasing the accessibility of technology for aging individuals in Hamilton, Guelph and London, ON. Through the application of interview-style research, prototype design and the creation of an online community for aging populations, this program is attempting to promote artistic creativity and the use of technology in aging populations in the area[D]irect [M]essage- Community-based art project that aims to share stories from aging individuals who live on Hamilton’s Barton Street. The project shares recordings of these folks’ stories to convey this area's history and cultural richness.ii. Arts educationThrough a number of projects, Centre[3] partners with local school boards to run programming in schools, including NuSteel, their alternative education program. Additionally, they also run several educational programs and run co-op programs that are open to artists so that they may develop their skills.Major Projects and EventsThe more recent major projects, exhibitions, and events are listed above in their respective sections of the Specializations, Methods, and Tools section.Analysis and Lessons LearnedA brief analysis of this organization and its impacts can be accessed here.ReferencesAll information included in this article was sourced from the Centre[3] website.Centre[3].

Additionally, it has aided them in making critical policy and decision-making decisions and,  Organizing RoundtablesOrigins and Development  The NCPR was founded in 2003 on the Campus of Kabul University by collaborating with The Konrad Adenauer Foundation of Germany, the Ministry of Higher Education, and Kabul University. It consisted of four research departments: the Department of Law and Political Science, the Department of Economy, Social Sciences, and the Department of Peace and Conflict.  The NCPR aimed to collaborate with other Afghan Universities, such as Kabul and Herat, and international institutions to exchange knowledge and experience through research. The NSPR has started a partnership program with esteemed German academic institutions to achieve this goal. In Germany, the main partners were the Institute of Development Research and Development Policy (IEE) at Ruhr University in Bochum, as well as the Centre for Development Research (ZEF) at Ruhr-Bochum University, Frankfurt University, Heidelberg University, and the German Afghan Universities cooperation (DAUG). In addition, this center had partnerships with organizations such as German International Cooperation (GIZ), NATO Diplomacy Division, Center of International Private Enterprises (CIPE), Afghanistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Democracy International (DI), Peace Build Canada, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, German Voice (DW) and Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC).  The NCPR initiated partnership with other Afghan Nongovernmental Organizations. However, many of these organizations have been involved in development projects and social activities without clear and well-thought-out strategies and scientific methods to achieve their goals. By collaborating with NCPR, these organizations enhanced their programs, resulting in more practical projects and better outcomes. The NCPR provided social science courses with research methods and created a database, while NGOs could suggest policies and activities for the well-being of people. Collaboration with national and international partners was crucial for the sustainability and strengthening of the center.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  From the 2003 mission to 2008, the NCPR was part of the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung (KAS) Kabul Office during its first- phase. Following 2008, The KAS directly funded the NCPR, with the KAS office in Kabul assessing, spending, and accounting for the NCPR budget. Since 2009, the Centre has operated independently, receiving funding from KAS and directly reporting expenditures to the Office in Berlin. [i] [1][i]  National Centre for Policy Research, official Webpage:  https://www.ncpr.af/  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The NCPR has selected the general director of the Centre from academic members of the Faculties of Law and Political Sciences, Economy, and Social Sciences. The department heads were chosen based on their qualifications through an online interview by KAS from Germany and a face-to-face interview by the NCPR office at Kabul University.  To participate in projects, individuals must have completed the Research Methodology course as an introductory course and met specific criteria, including their educational background, activities, scores, motivations, and related skills. It applied to both professors and students who were selected for these projects. The candidates were introduced officially by the academic administrative office. Successful candidates were responsible for the following activities:Literature review (Senior Professors)  Data Collections, Questionaries (Students). Conducting Interviews (Junior Professors)  Analysis (Senior Professors)  Report Writing (Senior Professors).The NCPR has also focused on selecting a vital research topic for the upcoming years. To do this, the Centre has organized annual consultancy workshops and roundtables. These events brought together scholars, researchers, practitioners, experts, and policymakers in research-related fields to vote for the most critical topics. Each year, the departments within the center undertook at least one research project, with Kabul University scholars and students leading the efforts. The NCPR then distributed the resulting reports to academic institutions, stakeholders, government officials, and anyone interested in Social Science. To date, the NCPR has published and shared over 50 research reports across the country.  Major Projects and Events  The major Projects and Events of NCPR have focused on the following areas:Enhanced capacity building,  Organizing roundtable discussions,  Conducted workshops and seminars,  Publications that have been extensively researched.The departments of Law and Political Sciences, Economy, Social Sciences, and Peace and Conflict Studies held a workshop in 2014 to discuss and vote on the most important and achievable research topics for the following year. The meeting took place in the center building. In 2014, participants evaluated and voted on the issues to be researched, which are listed below:“Administrative Reform and its Role in tackling corruption in Afghanistan"" (Department of Law and Political Sciences,  “Ways of Increasing the income sources in Afghanistan"" Opportunity and Challenges (Department of Economy),  “Corruption in Afghanistan with focus on Kabul Province” (Department of Social Sciences)  ""The Impacts of Media in Peace Building"" (Department of Peace and Conflict Studies).In 2014, the NCPR organized a roundtable on ""Illegal Money, Extortion, and Corruption"" for Private International Enterprises (CIEP) at the Nangarhar province municipality hall. The Workshop included participation from various government officials, private sector representatives, university scholars, students, and civil society members. The discussion revolved around the issue of the illegal extortion of money and corruption within the country, and the participants shared their suggestions and concerns.  In February 2014, NCPR partnered with KAS to conduct a public poll on political and security issues in five provinces of Afghanistan (Kabul, Nangarhar, Balkh, Herat, and Pakteya). The poll had a sample size of 5,000 participants who filled out questionnaires. According to the research reports, 63% of respondents were satisfied with the development of democracy, 46% were satisfied with the government's work, and 37% were confident with parliamentary work. Additionally, 73% said they would participate in the government election on February 5, 2015, while 53% thought the upcoming election needed more transparency. Moreover, 62% of the participants supported signing a security agreement with the US and NATO, and 61% expressed satisfaction with how the international community had assisted Afghanistan.  A conference was held on April 30, 2014, by the Women Regional Network and Equality for Peace and Democracy Organizations, which had technical support from NCPR, at the Kanrod Adenuar Hall in the NCPR building. During the conference, the organization's representative shared their research findings on ""Women's Perspective about Corruption, Peace, Security and Militarization of aids.”The Deputy of the Interior Ministry, civil society representatives, professors, students, and journalists attended the conference.  In May 2014, a ten-day training program in Konar province focused on monograph writing and seminar presentation skills. Approximately 350 students from various fields were attended in the Workshop, such as Economy, Psychology, Pedagogy, and Social Sciences. The program concluded with the presentation of research papers by individual participants. Moreover, the same training program was organized annually at the Faculty of Social Sciences at Kabul University. [i] [2][i]  National Centre for Policy Research, annual report, 2014.Pp:1-5.  The Department of Peace and Conflict Studies at NCPR organized a workshop on Nonviolent Communication and Restorative Circle at Kabul University. This program allowed students to learn new skills in positive thinking, peaceful behaviour, and attitude. Approximately 120 students, both male and female, benefited from the program.  The Department of Peace and Conflict, in partnership with several Afghan and International Civil Society organizations, initiated A Pathway to Peace Process to enhance the capacity of the Afghan Civil Society for peacebuilding, reconciliation, and dialogue. This process is supported by an international consortium of organizations, including the National Centre for Policy Research, Kabul University; the Afghan Civil Society Forum (ACSF); CARE, Afghanistan; the Women Activities &amp; Social Services Association (WASSA); Cooperation for Peace and Unity (CPAU) Afghanistan; Peacebuilding: the Canadian peacebuilding network; the 3D Security Initiative, Washington, D.C.; Concordis International, Cambridge, U.K.; The Group of 78, Ottawa; Project Ploughshares, Waterloo, Canada; and MATCH International. The initiative is also supported by the Global Partnership for the Prevention of Armed Conflict (GPPAC) and the Alliance for Peacebuilding (AfP). As part of McMaster's efforts to promote peace in Afghanistan, Dr. Seddiq Weera led the research to identify the root causes of the conflict and propose solutions for reconciliation. This research is part of the Afghanistan: Pathways to Peace project, which supports civil society-led approaches to peacebuilding.  The main goals of this initiative were to encourage and assist Afghan-led efforts for official and unofficial peace processes at community, national, and regional levels. It also aimed to establish a coordinating mechanism for civil society to promote peacebuilding and reconciliation in Afghanistan. Additionally, the initiative conducted practical research to address conflict issues and communicate with policy-makers to support peacebuilding and reconciliation efforts. The research focused on critical issues related to substantive and process-related conflicts.Dreams for Afghanistan  Biggest Injustices at present  Ethnic Grievances Related to Past Injustices  Healing the Wounds and Preventing Further Injustice  Foreign Influence and Foreign Relations  Peace and Stability in Afghanistan  Preparing the Ground for Peace and ReconciliationThe Canadian Government's Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade funded the initial phase of activities from December 2009 to June 2010. This phase consisted of field research, desk research, a symposium called ""Coordinating Peace Efforts in Afghanistan"" in Kabul in February 2010, and a civil society Peace Conference titled ""A Common Voice for Peace and Reconciliation"" in April 2010. The Field research took place from January to March 2010 and involved conducting semi-structured interviews with 453 men and women from various ethnic, linguistic, and social backgrounds across 11 provinces of Afghanistan. Additionally, 130 men and women participated in 30 focus group discussions across 12 provinces. The survey and the focus groups asked participants to share their vision of an ideal Afghanistan. The results of this research informed the Peace Conference. Afghans from all over their country had similar aspirations for their future. They envision a secure, united, prosperous, progressive, democratic, and politically stable Islamic government free from corruption and discrimination.

The organization seeks to empower communities to actively participate in the defense of their rights and works to create spaces for dialogue and action that foster a culture of respect for human rights and human dignity.  VISION: To build a democratic, just, and equitable society where human rights are respected and protected, and where individuals and communities are free and autonomous to make decisions that affect their lives and surroundings.  Origins and Development  A segment of civil society in Chihuahua, known as the ""Red Ciudadana,"" had been advocating for a Citizen Participation Law since 2001. However, it wasn't until 2017, with a change in state government, that the proposal was finally presented to the Congress. During that time, a voluntary collective called Wikipolítica Chihuahua, in which we were involved, had been organizing for a year and participated in protests against the Peña Nieto government's ""Gasolinazo."" We promoted our proposal #SinVotoNoHayDinero, which aimed to link party financing to electoral votes obtained. Unfortunately, this proposal was rejected in Congress, leading us to realize that we couldn't rely on the so-called ""representatives."" We understood that real change could only be achieved through direct participation.  Paquita Jiménez, a prominent advocate for Citizen Participation in Chihuahua and director of the Red Ciudadana, invited us to those initial protests and later called on us to defend the Citizen Participation Law proposal in the State Congress. After over a decade of struggle, we finally had the opportunity to turn this proposal into reality. However, a problem emerged: a Citizen Participation Law couldn't exist without people's participation. Therefore, we needed to raise awareness about the potential that this law could bring and capture people's attention to demand our right to participate.  We needed to believe in the possibility of a new story that depended on us pressuring the lawmakers not to turn the law into an empty measure, leaving behind any pretense and ensuring that participation mechanisms were accessible to everyone. We took to the streets and used social media with the slogan #DependeDeNosotras, emphasizing that our demands should become a reality. After a year of participating in technical discussion tables, using social media to inform decision-makers, and engaging with the public through an intense campaign, we successfully defended each participation mechanism, fighting for feasible figures to encourage more people to get involved. We used every possible method, including social media, newspapers, marches, and interviews. Finally, in May 2018, the Citizen Participation Law was approved, fulfilling a social demand that created new counterbalances to prevent abuses of power and enable us to participate beyond merely voting in elections. This law also established citizen participation as a Human Right in the State Constitution. It became evident that our voices could make a significant impact.  Less than a year after the approval of the Citizen Participation Law, on February 18, 2019, we found ourselves in the need to put it into practice. In collaboration with the ""Salvemos los Cerros"" movement, we participated in the first municipal Public Hearing in the State of Chihuahua, demanding a halt to the construction of a gas station in the Cerro Grande ""Arewákawi."" Following this joint effort, we engaged in months of technical discussions, where we had to fight for every paragraph of the State and Municipal Participation Regulations through exhausting debates with the current administration's council members. That same year, we actively participated in the first Open City Council in the city's history, highlighting the importance of participation and being heard to achieve true democracy.  In 2019, on April 26, the City Council approved a project that aimed to concession and privatize the municipality's public lighting for 15 years, amounting to 6.2 billion pesos. Faced with this situation, a group of individuals came together to form the collective ""Chihuahua Decide."" We decided to activate the first binding Plebiscite in Chihuahua's history, consulting people on whether they were in favor or against the project. To achieve this, we collected over 3,424 signatures within a 90-day period. We participated as the organizing group, and Carlos served as the common representative of the plebiscite's driving group, as well as the spokesperson and communication director of the campaign opposing the project. With just one month and an exceptional volunteer team, we led the collective creation of the citizen campaign #NoQuierenLuzQuierenDinero (They Don't Want Light, They Want Money), with minimal resources that included developing a media plan, negative news coverage, an online campaign, as well as online and physical activations, and a debate with the municipality. In the end, we succeeded in having 62,032 people vote, with an overwhelming victory against the mega-project. This municipal plebiscite surpassed by 40,000 votes the Chapultepec Corridor Consultation in Mexico City and the Marcelino García Barragán Cycle Path consultation in Guadalajara, Jalisco. That was when we realized that ""the more people decide, the more we can achieve.""

Their mission also involves ensuring corporations and businesses respect human rights and their environmental responsibilities to promote social, economic, and ecological justice for these communitiesOrigins and Development  Inclusive Development International was founded in 2012 to help provide strategies and resources to individuals and groups pushing for inclusive development.They partner with organizations in Africa and Southeast Asia to fight back against “human rights abuses caused by unjust development.”Their cornerstone project, “Following the Money to Justice began in 2016 as a response to the global land-grabbing crisis.  Developmental projects facilitated by large corporations in these areas often have a way of disenfranchising, underdeveloping, and stressing vulnerable populations with very few “local benefits.” As such, IDI puts a stop to destructive developmental projects that promote human rights abuse.  These harmful projects are usually funded by organizations (multinationals, commodity traders and buyers, private equity investors, global brands) that are “bound by rules that require them to do no harm and respect human rights and to the environment” and present themselves as “responsible corporate citizens. However, the nature of this funding makes it hard for these organizations to be identified, rendering it difficult for these grassroots communities to defend their rights effectively.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingIDI has a board of directors and a team of experts that deal with the day-to-day operations.

The organization primarily focuses on improving women's socio-economic status and enlightening them through their involvement in different development activities. AWC is registered as a charity NGO with the Governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan. It has been running various activities for Afghan refugees in Peshawar, Pakistan, since 1986, and it has also been operating a hospital in Kabul since 1992. AWC is registered with the Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Women Affairs UNDP, UNOPS, and WFP as an Afghan NGO and with the Ministry of Justice as a social organization.  The core goals of AWC are to improve the living conditions and strengthen the health, education, and socio-economic status of women and children in Afghan society. They aim to accomplish this through their involvement in development activities, which include:  - Securing women's civil and social rights based on Islamic principles and Afghan culture and traditions.  - Creating understanding, cooperation, and harmony among Afghan women on national and international issues.  - Advancing the place of women in Afghan society.  - Encouraging and promoting education for Afghan women at the national level.  - Improving Afghan women's social, economic, health, and cultural conditions.  - Establishing friendly relations with similar organizations around the world.  - Providing opportunities for women to actively educate the next generation in the rehabilitation and development of Afghan society by building their capacity.  AWC is committed to working effectively within its mandate, mission, and objectives for Afghanistan and its people.  Origins and Development  Afghan women have always played a crucial and active role in the fight for freedom. Many brave Afghan women have fought against invaders throughout history, becoming a glorious part of the country's history. These events are unforgettable and will serve as a source of encouragement and inspiration for future generations.  Given the immense suffering that women in Afghanistan faced during the resistance against the Soviet occupation, it is necessary to ensure that they have full access to fundamental human rights. The Afghanistan Women's Council was established to advocate for better conditions for Afghan women and increase awareness of human rights, women's rights, refugee rights, children's rights, peace-building, and democracy issues within the Afghan context. It is worth mentioning that the AWC has received four international awards for its performance in these areas since its establishment in 1986.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Fatana Ishaq Gailani is the organization's Founder and President, with over nine members serving as acting directors, managers, trainers, and advisers on the board. She is also the Human Rights Director of the organization. This organization has received funding and support from various entities, including the World Food Programme, War Child Canada, the Canadian International Agency, the Development Organization of the Czech Republic, the European Union, and the Department of International Development.

Please help us complete it.Before establishing each Women's Committee, the project team overcame the target community's unique social and economic barriers. Customs were observed to ensure community support for the action, and local communities were involved in the establishment process. Community experts were hired for the program, and they conducted sensitization workshops and awareness sessions and efficiently mobilized elders and other members of local families. Additionally, they advertised the project's activities and benefits to gain more support from the community. advertising the project's activities and benefits.Major Projects and Events  AWC has undertaken several major projects, including Basic Education, which aims to empower women in Afghanistan. As part of this effort, children are encouraged to attend school, freeing time for their mothers to take classes. The curriculum covers a range of topics such as literacy, math, health, parenting, conflict resolution, peace-building, environment, community leadership, rehabilitation, human rights, women's rights, the rule of law, transitional justice, good governance, civil society, democracy, peace development, and reconciliation. In addition, AWC specializes in Community Development, Health, Alternative Livelihood Programs, and small and medium-sized Enterprise Development. Since 1986, thousands of Afghan women have been taught and empowered through these programs.  One of the primary issues faced by women is the lack of education. Afghanistan has one of the lowest literacy rates for adult women worldwide, resulting in a lack of understanding of fundamental human rights and gender equality. This makes women feel less confident and unable to participate actively in public and private spheres.  Furthermore, traditional practices that prevent women from directly interacting with male purchasers and traders negatively impact their ability to start productive businesses. These challenges and a lack of necessary skills often leave women alone to handle household problems. Consequently, community-level issues are given lower priority than individual problems.  Healthcare: Mother and Child Health Clinic:  The Mother and Child Health Clinic commenced its services in 2000 to provide healthcare facilities to 25,000 low-income families in the Shahrak Khurasan area of Kabul. Despite the lack of support from any donor, the clinic successfully continued its operations until 2002. Eleven dedicated staff members provided their services for 10 hours daily without compensation. They visited 60-80 mothers and children daily and provided them with lab tests and proper medication.  Psychosocial Support and Counseling:  Psychological support and counselling are essential for maintaining good mental health. The AWC offered individual and group counselling sessions to promote self-esteem and self-confidence. The counselling sessions also aimed to improve interpersonal and inter-group relations. The AWC also provided support for managing stress, anger, and grief.  [i]Relief &amp; RehabilitationAWC has been actively involved in providing relief and rehabilitation services to the people of Afghanistan. Mainly, AWC has provided relief aid to 1,000 women during winter. Additionally, AWC has been supporting many more women monthly. Furthermore, AWC has completed a relief project in Paktika and Parwan Provinces. The project provided clean drinking water and necessary materials for shelter and food to 500 families. This project was initiated in 2002 and has proved to be very helpful for the communities in these provinces. In terms of rehabilitation, AWC has completed drinking water projects with the support of the local people. These projects have helped 25 families access clean drinking water by installing a deep well with a hand pump.RIGHTS, PEACE &amp; DEMOCRACYAWC has attended conferences, workshops, and seminars on human rights, peace-building, and democracy worldwide since 1993, explicitly concerning Afghan women's issues. AWC provided training courses on human rights, women's rights, peace-building, democracy, and management to Afghan women residing in Afghanistan and the Afghan Refugee environment in Peshawar, Pakistan. AWC conducted seminars and workshops to raise awareness among women regarding their rights and unite them to amplify their voices. This helps them secure their rights in society, starting from the family level and moving up to high positions in government.  The Afghan Women's Council (AWC) has played a crucial role in encouraging women to participate in the presidential and parliamentary elections, a significant step in promoting gender equality in the country. The AWC has also raised concerns about the country's violation of human and women's rights to the President and cabinet members. The council has organized several meetings with high-ranking officials to discuss national and international issues.  Moreover, the AWC has regularly reported on human rights abuses in Afghanistan and appealed to the international community, such as the United Nations, Amnesty International, and other international human rights organizations.  The AWC seeks financial and professional assistance from individuals and institutions to achieve its goals while maintaining its sovereignty and independence. The AWC is responsible to its partners and communities by providing periodic and annual progress and financial reports and regularly evaluating its activities.  AWC provided several programs to its participants, including Income Generation Training, Vocational Training, Skills Sharing Workshops, and Introduction to Micro-Finance Training. The Income Generation Training included topics such as marketing, management, small business, basic accounting, entrepreneurship, legal and gender issues. Vocational Training offered training in sewing, knitting, handicrafts, soap making, vegetable gardening, sweet and pickle making, and poultry raising. In the Skills Sharing Workshops, women shared knowledge, experiences, and lessons learned in project-related areas. The Introduction to Micro-Finance Training covered features such as an explanation of the structure and purpose of micro-finance, including loans, savings programs, and Village Organizations.Micro-Finance:AWC has provided skills training to 5,000 widows and the most vulnerable women in Benehesar, Qala e Musa, Qala e Fatullah, Deh Afghanistan, Kandahar, Parwan, and Jalalabad. These women were able to run their businesses and support their families. To further support economic stability, AWC planned to provide loans to 1,500 widows and vulnerable women in Kabul, Parwan, Kandahar, and Jalalabad. This enabled them to establish their businesses and have a sustainable source of income.  AWC organized several meetings to achieve specific goals. The meetings included:  - Home Visits: Participants and their families were met to explain the program and gain support for women's participation.  - Small Group Meetings: Women worked together as a group, guaranteeing joint loans, repayment, marketing, and supporting each other's businesses.  - Village Organization Meetings: Women formed a community to manage credit and savings and support one another in developing their small businesses.  - Micro-Finance Committee Meetings: Meetings were held for project planning, development, implementation, and monitoring related to micro-finance to ensure success.  - Steering Committee Meetings: The Steering Committee provided greater oversight, overseeing project planning, development, implementation, and monitoring.  - Working Group Meetings: The Working Group meetings included a detailed analysis of women's needs, focusing on vocational training and income generation. [ii]The Afghanistan Women's Council puts great emphasis on staff development. They train their staff on various topics such as human rights, women's and children's rights, labour rights, peace development, democracy, micro-finance, MF management, office management, women's leadership, accounting, social organization, and gender issues. To further enhance their knowledge, some staff were sent to New Delhi and Sri Lanka to participate in seminars and workshops. The council also conducted various seminars and workshops in Kabul, Parwan, Kandahar and Jalalabad to raise awareness among Afghans, especially women, and to encourage them to participate in the presidential and parliamentary elections. Additionally, AWC is recognized worldwide as a human rights defender organization, and thus, they have actively participated in most of the seminars, workshops, and meetings on such issues.

Its primary objective was to conduct comprehensive research on Afghan women's lives' political, social, economic, and cultural aspects. Over the years, Afghan women have been denied their fundamental human rights, and their rights were not acknowledged by the various governments in power. Therefore, AWC decided to establish a research center to raise awareness about this issue and study how Afghan women can effectively regain their rights while adhering to religion, Afghan culture, and traditions.  AWC is reflecting women's issues in its weekly publication, and a research magazine will be published on these topics as soon as the proposal for this project is approved. The center regularly conducts round table discussions with the active participation of women to discuss and evaluate major historical events, human rights, and women's rights. Reports of these discussions are published weekly in local media, and their appeals are passed on to the international community. [i][i]  Afghanistan Women Council. International Support. 2019.

This was in stark contrast to the harsh period of de facto Taliban rule from 1996 to 2001, when the regime was hostile towards civil society organizations, and the international community was not yet prepared to invest in this area. Despite this, there were some Afghan NGOs that actively monitored and reported on the conflict during the Taliban era and played a crucial role in exerting international pressure. However, they had limited opportunities to influence the regime.  The involvement of Afghan civil society in the Shia Law debate started when a parliamentarian alerted civil society representatives that a draft law was being considered by the Wolesi Jirga (the lower house of parliament). Several civil society organizations worked together with concerned MPs to propose specific amendments to the law that would bring it in line with international human rights standards. In addition, recommendations were also drawn from other sources of Shia jurisprudence, including renowned and highly respected religious scholars in the region. Meetings with Sunni and Shia members of parliament and other political actors were held, and the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) played a crucial role in mobilizing a broader civil society network. Up to 30 different organizations, including the Swiss-supported Civil Society and Human Rights Network, Global Rights, UNIFEM, and others, became involved in advocating against the law following the international outcry against it.  ACSF was known for its impartiality and non-partisan identity, which were its main characteristics. It believed in democratic principles of people's participation and was committed to empowering the Afghan population. Additionally, ACSF embraced the diversity of civil society stakeholders and emphasized non-partisanship, transparency, accountability, and promoting a sense of voluntarism and social activism.  The objectives of ACSF were to promote the development of civil society in Afghanistan, increase the involvement of all sectors and levels of Afghan society in the reconstruction, development, and peace process, enable civil society to have a voice on critical national issues, and strengthen the networking of civil society. [i] [1][i]  Swiss agency for Development and cooperation (SDC) (2009). Afghanistan Civil Society Forum.  https://www.eda.admin.ch/deza/en/home/themes-sdc/fragile-contexts-and-prevention.html/content/dezaprojects/SDC/en/2005/7F04159/phase3Origins and Development  The Afghan Civil Society Forum was created in 2001 to foster a partnership between Afghan civil society stakeholders and Swisspeace. This was done at the request of 76 participants of the first Afghan Civil Society Conference in Germany. The conference was held alongside a meeting of political representatives organized by the UN at Petersburg near Bonn. The goal of the conference was to involve Afghan civil society in the peace and reconstruction process using a bottom-up approach.  [i] [2] The information was based on research conducted by the Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit (AREU) on the process of drafting the Shia Personal Law and the subsequent signing and revision of the law in June 2009.  Civil society in Afghanistan played a significant role in shaping new laws and advocating for the rights of the people. In one example from 2009, the Afghan parliament passed a law that applied to the country's Shia minority, requiring women to obtain their husband's permission before leaving their homes and making it illegal to refuse sexual intercourse with their husbands. This law, known as the Shia Personal Status Law or the Shia Law, was met with widespread criticism from both the international community and Afghan society. Switzerland also expressed its concern about the law. As a result, some of the most controversial provisions, such as the minimum age for marriage for girls, have already been revised, and the sections related to restrictions on movement and sexual behaviour are under reconsideration. The revision process has been facilitated by the efforts of civil society organizations, which have played a crucial role in promoting these amendments.  ACSF's success demonstrates how even small donors like Switzerland can significantly impact Afghanistan. The Board of Directors of ACSF was made up of nine national and two international members, including SDC's Country Director. Furthermore, Switzerland has gained a reputation for supporting civil society organizations, networks, and human rights in Afghanistan. SDC focused on promoting human rights-based approaches, including in the rural development sector. They also supported the establishment and functioning of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) and the Human Rights Support Unit at the Ministry of Justice to mainstream the issue within the Afghan government. In addition,Switzerland was widely recognized for its non-partisan and purely civilian engagement in civil society and human rights in Afghanistan. Aziz Rafie attests that Switzerland was considered to be one of the most non-biased states in Afghanistan. Despite the commitment of Switzerland and other countries, much work remains to be done. All stakeholders, both Afghan and international, will continue to face significant challenges for many years to come. [ii] [1]  The Advocacy section of ACSFo has set up four advocacy committees, which are as follows: the Advocacy Committee for Persons with Disabilities (ACPD), the Environment Protection Advocacy Committee (EPAC), the Afghan Youth Advocacy Committee, the Economic Literacy and Budget Analysis Group (ELBAG) in Kabul and the regional advocacy committee in Bamyan, Nangarhar, Gardez, and Balkh provinces. [iii] [2]ACSFo has recently made significant changes to its core programmatic intervention and strategy in response to the situation in Afghanistan post-August 2021. Over the last ten years, ACSFo has undertaken more than 52 programmatic interventions in this area, with five new interventions initiated in 2021.

Officail Website:  https://endwaterpoverty.org/member/afghanistan-civil-society-forum-organization/Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingThe Afghan Civil Society Forum (ACSF) became an independent organization in February 2002 with the help of initial funding from the Swiss and German governments. Its office in Kabul opened two months later. Initially, ACSF conducted dialogue exchanges and confidence-building forums to identify topics of relevance for the peace and reconstruction process that might have otherwise been neglected. In 2003 and 2004, ACSF focused on supporting the Bonn Agreement's implementation and conducted educational and advocacy activities for the drafting of Afghanistan's new Constitution, voter education, and events preparing for the October 2004 presidential elections. In 2005, ACSF continued to focus on elections by undertaking a massive voter education project before the September 2005 parliamentary elections. ACSF was deeply involved in the upcoming elections with the Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation (SDC), bringing civil society into the discussion of the preparatory process and earmarking half a million Swiss Francs for ACSF's activities as part of its financial contribution to the international election support program.  [i]  [1][i]  Swiss agency for Development and cooperation (SDC) (2009). Afghanistan Civil Society Forum.  https://www.eda.admin.ch/deza/en/home/themes-sdc/fragile-contexts-and-prevention.html/content/dezaprojects/SDC/en/2005/7F04159/phase3Specializations, Methods and ToolsIt is evident that organizations and civil society leaders took up the issue of making the law of their own accord, without being formally invited by the Ministry of Justice or any other government actor. They became involved in the process by inserting themselves and insisting that they had valuable contributions to offer, rather than participating as formally recognized elements of civil society in law-making.  It is apparent that there were no formalized interactions between voters and their parliamentary representatives. As a result, civil society organizations must bear a significant burden. A representative from one such organization stated that there is minimal public discussion of laws, and parliamentarians are not in touch with their constituents. Thus, they rely heavily on civil society. Despite this, the example of the Shia Law illustrates how civil society has been effective in playing a watchdog role over the parliament and executive. Citizen groups, who were not accustomed to participating meaningfully in the political system at the national level, have taken on the role of concerned citizens. As per recent research, it was revealed that civil society ultimately influenced the content of the law and later succeeded in having it put under review. This was due to the impetus from the international outcry over the law and the massive international media coverage that set off condemnation from Western leaders. This kind of protest inside Afghanistan was unique and dangerous but was supported robustly by established civil society organizations. [i] [1][i]  Swiss agency for Development and cooperation (SDC) (2009). Afghanistan Civil Society Forum.  https://www.eda.admin.ch/deza/en/home/themes-sdc/fragile-contexts-and-prevention.html/content/dezaprojects/SDC/en/2005/7F04159/phase3Major Projects and Events  The ACSF, which had over 100 members and worked with more than 200 partners, had six offices scattered throughout the country before the government's collapse in 2021. The forum's primary responsibilities included coordinating various civil society organizations, providing civic education, building capacity, conducting advocacy work, and carrying out research on civil society issues.  The Afghan Civil Society Forum (ACSF) played an essential role in coordinating and integrating the various segments of Afghan civil society, which are traditionally divided along tribal, kinship, and religious lines. The ACSF represented Afghanistan's civil society organizations in international conferences such as the Donor Conference in Paris in June 2008 and the international conference in The Hague in March 2009. Additionally, ACSF's website receives 250 visitors every day, with the largest group coming from the United States, Iran, or Germany. Over the past two decades, the organization has published 42 editions of its monthly magazine, Jamea-e-Madani, which is considered one of the best magazines on civil society issues by intellectual circles. [i] [1]  In 2009, EPAC conducted seven regular advocacy committee meetings and four other meetings to address environmental concerns such as air, earth, and water pollution, and more specifically, contamination of underground water and its solutions. Furthermore, EPAC members prepared a report on ""usage of underground water and absorbing wells"", and were provided with the national environment protection law. Finally, a resolution was developed by the committee to control air pollution, which was subsequently sent to the media.  The members of ELBAG conducted ten advocacy meetings focusing on issues related to accountability and transparency, and they also prepared a report on the agricultural sector and its further development in the country. They collaborated with OSI's informal initiative for EITI advocacy to promote transparency and accountability. This joint effort would continue to support civil society and ACSFo's advocacy programs.  ACSFo's advocacy section was involved in several workshops and conferences in addition to their thematic working areas. Here are some highlights:ACSFo was responsible for the expenditure of invitation cards, their distribution, and the development of mottos for the Women's International Day celebration on March 8th in the Loya Jirga tent. This event was held in cooperation with AIHRC and other civil society organizations.  ACSFo arranged two preparatory meetings with the media, journalist unions, and representatives of CSOs to hold a press conference. The invitation letter was published in three daily newspapers: the 8 am, Arman and Wisa. The press conference was held on September 16th in ACSFo to discuss the martyrdom of Sultan Ahmad Munadi and other journalists killed during the year 2009. The press statement included precise and logical wills from the government of Afghanistan and the British embassy. The conference was attended by a large number of civil society activists, media representatives, and journalists and was broadly broadcast by mass media.  ACSFo also held a press conference on October 7th to discuss the decline of women's seats in provincial councils. This event was attended by a large number of women activists, and the messages of the conference were widely broadcast by the media.  On October 14th, the third conference on the status of presidential and provincial councils' elections was held in ACSFo. The conference was organized by ACSFo and representatives of civil society organizations. Its main focus was on ensuring transparency in the elections and adherence to the constitution and other laws. The conference was widely broadcasted by the media.

Annual Narrative Report To SDC.  http://acsf.af/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ACSFo-Annual-Report-2009-.pdfAnalysis and Lessons Learned  Advocacy is a relatively new topic in Afghanistan, and many people lack knowledge and skills in this area. Most people do not understand the concept of advocacy, its role and importance, and how advocates can play an active role in creating, amending, and applying policies, laws, and strategies.  The Advocacy Committee for Persons with Disability, Afghan Youths Advocacy Committee, and Environment Protection Advocacy Committee have been busy with advocacy activities, lobbying, and campaigns. These committees have achieved a lot through the use of advocacy tools, such as contributing to the drafting, amending, and changing of laws and policies, such as the Elimination of Violence against Women (EVAW) Law, Environment Protection Law, National Disability Law, Media Law, and Mines Law.  However, a more systematic approach to advocacy was needed to make these activities more effective. This required knowledge, skills, and methodology in advocacy, using practical tools, and making coalitions.  Advocacy activities and initiatives faced many challenges in society, especially in post-conflict countries like Afghanistan. One of the biggest challenges for advocacy activities in Afghanistan was the lack of security. In 2009, the advocacy section experienced many security challenges that prohibited advocacy activities, such as campaigns, conferences, meetings, and workshops. Another significant challenge was the lack of knowledge and awareness among people on the concept of advocacy, advocacy methodology, and its role and importance, which further deprived people of their rights and hindered their participation in advocacy campaigns and activities.  The lack of participation and activeness of members of the Environment Protection Advocacy Committee and Afghan Youths Advocacy Committee in meetings and other advocacy events due to their engagement in their offices was also notable. The employment fluctuation and the appointment of new staff caused a gap in the activities of the advocacy section in 2009, which was another challenge. The delay in the follow-up of the approval of the National Disability Law due to presidential and provincial councils' elections and the engagement of some members of parliament in election campaigns was the other challenge during this reporting period. [i] [2]  In Afghanistan, community shuras (which were councils of elders and leaders) and tribal and religious institutions had traditionally represented their communities to the authorities. However, the modern version of the country's civil society had only recently come into existence. Bridging the gap between the modern and traditional forms of civil society has been a major challenge for Afghanistan, as the elders and tribal or religious leaders have been the most influential people in Afghan society. This has resulted in a controversy regarding the link between traditional and modern civil society. Traditional values and practices have been shaped over several centuries and were dominated by traditional, customary, tribal, ethnic, and linguistic mindsets, which were not subject to change or revision. On the other hand, modern values were more logical and subject to discourse, debate, change, and development, as Aziz Rafie explains. However, there was little dialogue between civil society and the clergy who oversee omnipresent religious traditions. [ii] [1][i]  [i] Afghanistan Civil Society Forum-organization (ACSFo) (2009).

This was done through fostering continuous and meaningful interaction with civil society stakeholders, creating opportunities for partnerships, and enabling cross-learning and networking. The Working Group conducted an annual meeting while its Steering Committee meets every quarter. In 2018, the group was attended by 46 CSOs, and the topics discussed included mechanisms for increasing cooperation among certified CSOs and their constituencies. [i] [1]  The Core objectives of AICS:  - Certify local organizations against recognized standards  - Coordinate capacity-building initiatives against performance indicators. [ii] [2][i] Afghanistan Institute For Civil Society (AICS) official website page: https://aicsafg.org/[ii]  Caroline Takawira and Maxwell Saungweme, (2019) Afghanistan Institute for Civil Society (AICS). Policy and Procedures Manual.  https://aicsafg.org/Origins and Development  The idea of establishing the Afghanistan Institute for Civil Society (AICS) has been evolving for several years within the country's civil society community. In 2007, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Aga Khan Development Network, the World Bank, the United Nations Development Program, and the Asia Development Bank organized the Enabling Environment Conference to discuss ways to create a favourable environment for such an institute.  One of the main recommendations made at the conference was to establish independent certification bodies for civil society organizations that the Government would recognize, the private sector, donor agencies, and civil society. In 2010, a working group comprising donors, civil society networks, and INGOs was created. The working group developed the vision, mission, and strategic objectives of the Afghanistan Independent Civil Society Organization (AICS). AICS was established by the Aga Khan Foundation (AKF) in partnership with Counterpart International under the USAID-funded Afghanistan Civic Engagement Program (ACEP) in 2014. The long-term goal of AICS was to enable CSOs to realize their potential in support of the development of Afghanistan. This initiative was backed by crucial CSO networks, civil society professionals, and representatives from national and international CSOs who have an interest in Afghanistan. [i] [1][i]  Afghanistan Institute For Civil Society (AICS) official website page:  https://aicsafg.org/Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The Afghanistan Institute for Civil Society (AICS) became an NGO registered with the Ministry of Economy (MoEc) in 2014 and was officially launched in February 2015. Its long-term goal was to support civil society in Afghanistan and help it realize its potential to contribute to the development of the country. The organization's third Executive Director played a critical role in ensuring its programmatic and organizational success. Being unique and essential to Afghanistan's civil society, the AICS required a competent leader to steer it towards success.  [i] [5]In additions, The establishment of the AICS is being supported by the USAID funding. [ii] [1][i]  Afghanistan Institute for Civil Society. Official Website page:  https://easyjoob.com/companies/afghanistan-institute-for-civil-society-aics/[ii]  Afghanistan Institute For Civil Society (AICS) official website page:  https://aicsafg.org/   Specializations, Methods and Tools  AICS has made significant contributions to enhancing education in Afghanistan through its multifaceted approach. This approach includes digital learning, capacity building, policy influence, and collaboration. AICS has expertise in conducting thorough assessments of community education, identifying gaps, and understanding specific requirements. It facilitates collaboration with local stakeholders and engages with leaders, teachers, parents, and community members. This builds partnerships and empowers Shuras to manage schools effectively. Furthermore, AICS has the proven expertise to design a flexible and relevant curriculum that addresses the unique needs and challenges of community-based education (CBE), especially alternative learning classes (ALC). AICS can provide comprehensive training to teachers on CBE, driven by years of community-level expertise and contextual needs. Monitoring and evaluation are vital elements in achieving substantial progress, and AICS has relied on this to enhance the capacity of numerous grassroots organizations relevant to education. In addition, AICS has the expertise to lay out mechanisms adaptable to the CBE needs to evaluate the local shura contribution and the entire unplaced system's competency and applicability to achieve the intended progress. With the objective of conducting CBS and ALC classes successfully in Afghanistan, AICS has the potential to make a significant impact.  After assessing various CSOs under its Certification program and analyzing key findings, AICS found that many CSOs require assistance in developing policies for different organizational functions. To help address this need, AICS has created a set of generic policy reference manuals for essential management functions that can be adapted to an organization's internal culture, values, context, and structure. These policy reference manuals/guidebooks have been developed with the aim of strengthening the management of CSOs. [i] [1][i]  Afghanistan Institute For Civil Society (AICS) official website page:  https://aicsafg.org/Major Projects and Events  These are the core activities of AICS:  The AICS Certification Program was designed to enhance the effectiveness and credibility of the civil society sector by certifying CSOs against recognized standards, both locally and internationally. From an organizational perspective, civil society is defined as the voluntary association of people in a society. The certification program empowers CSOs to align their policies, processes, structure, programs, and activities with the best international practices, thereby contributing to the growth of a competent, transparent, and effective civil society in Afghanistan.  AICS had the knowledge and skills to significantly contribute to reducing the education gap in Afghanistan, especially in women's education. They established a strong network with NGOs/CSOs nationwide through initiatives such as National Civil Society Week (NCSW) and (SEECA). The DCOP provided e-learning courses and peer-to-peer learning facilities that empower individuals and organizations to develop and refine their skills and knowledge, enabling them to tackle the unique challenges faced in Afghanistan. This created a strong community of sharing and collaboration, increasing the effectiveness and impact of their work. Their innovative approach to blended learning in civil society, which combines in-person training, workshops, and mentorship sessions with impactful e-learning content, has made a lasting impression on member organizations and the overall civic space. With the guidance of Education Advisors, AICS was well-positioned to play a critical role in advancing Afghanistan's National Education system towards sustainability and resilience.  AICS improved the relevance and effectiveness of capacity-building services for Afghan CSOs by coordinating and harmonizing initiatives. Moreover, AICS organized two cross-learning events to assist CSOs interested in applying for certification. The objectives of the events were to foster discussions, exchange ideas, enhance the organizational performance of CSOs, and promote the work of certified CSOs. During the first event, ten representatives of certified and non-certified CSOs from Takhar, Nangarhar, Herat, Paktia, and Kabul provinces discussed the benefits and merits of the certification program. In the second event, AICS-certified CSOs presented and discussed human resources, governance, strategic planning, communications and outreach, and financial management benchmarks. In total, 19 CSOs benefited from these events.  The Afghanistan Institute for Civil Society conducted quarterly Information Sessions for representatives of donors, INGOs and CSOs. These sessions aimed to increase CSOs' access to efficient, quality and relevant capacity-building services. During the sessions, stakeholders discussed the persistent gaps and strengths of CSOs that were assessed through AICS' certification program. This allowed stakeholders to interact, understand and suggest ways forward to strengthen CSOs' capacity in areas such as governance, project management, financial management, communication, and human resource management.  Policy Engagement and Research:AICS Policy Engagement and Research aimed to influence policies, monitor government accountability, and advocate for reforms through effective initiatives. This unit conducted civil society thematic roundtables in provinces and issued policy briefs on relevant civil society issues in Afghanistan.  State of the Enabling Environment for Civil Society in Afghanistan (SEECA):Civil society organizations (CSOs) played a crucial role in development. They complement the efforts of the government, private sector, and donors. AICS recognizes that the enabling environment plays a crucial role in promoting or hindering the effectiveness of civil society. Therefore, AICS has conducted its annual flagship research on the State of the Enabling Environment for CSOs in Afghanistan (SEECA) since 2016. The research examined the legal framework, governance, socio-cultural environment, and financial and security environments in which CSOs operate. It was the responsibility of all actors, including the government, private sector, CSOs, international community, and donors, to enhance the CSO enabling environment. The study provides recommendations based on the research findings, either directly suggested by respondents or corresponding to the challenges CSOs are facing in Afghanistan. AICS has conducted SEECA research in 2016, 2017, and 2018.  Roundtables: AICS organized several thematic roundtables in Kabul, Herat, Kandahar, Balkh, Nangarhar, and Bamyan after its establishment. The objective of these roundtables was to bring together civil society activists, media representatives, university lecturers, government officials, and think tank scholars to share their thoughts and ideas regarding the relevant discussions. Regional Collaboration:Innovation for Change was a growing global network of people and online hubs. The network has regional hubs in Africa, Central Asia, East Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, South Asia, and the Pacific. These hubs serve as a meeting point for individuals and organizations to connect, exchange ideas, and collaborate to find solutions to today's and tomorrow's challenges.  The South Asia Hub of Innovation for Change provides an inclusive and secure space to design ideas for creating an enabling environment for civil society. This was especially relevant in areas where government restrictions impede the ability of civil society organizations to work together and achieve their goals. The Afghanistan Institute for Civil Society hosted the Secretariat of the Innovation for Change South Asia Hub. It coordinated events and activities in the South Asia region to promote the exchange of ideas and foster collaboration amongst organizations. [i] [1][i]  Afghanistan Institute For Civil Society (AICS) official website page:  https://aicsafg.org/Analysis and Lessons Learned  In 2019, AICS assessed a total of 34 civil society organizations (CSOs) in Afghanistan, which included 11 large and medium-sized CSOs, as well as 23 grassroots CSOs. In total, 107 CSOs have been assessed so far, and out of these, 57 have successfully obtained the minimum score required for certification and have been conferred with an AICS certificate. In 2019, 15 CSOs were certified, out of which nine were medium-large, and six were grassroots organizations. However, the remaining 19 CSOs were deferred as they were unable to achieve the minimum score required for certification. AICS identified the areas of improvement for these deferred CSOs and hoped to reassess them once they address these gaps during the deferral period.

ACDO. official website page:  https://acdo-af.org/Origins and Development  Asia Community Development Organization (ACDO) is a non-governmental, non-political, non-profit humanitarian organization based in Afghanistan. It was founded in 2014 and registered with the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GoIRA) under the supervision of the Ministry of Economy. [i] [1]  ACDO is active in most parts of Afghanistan and intends to expand its operations to the remaining provinces. The organization aims to become a leading and developed entity that delivers assistance and support to many people affected by long-protracted and sudden on-set emergencies in the country. To achieve success, it is vital to build local trust by offering solutions acceptable in a male-dominated society while complying with traditions, customs, and Islamic values. Additionally, ACDO is committed to empowering women, a significant yet marginalized group in society, by enabling their active participation in civic life and decision-making. The organization maintains close coordination and contact with relevant ministries, departments, and stakeholders at the national and sub-national levels. Local bodies and institutions, including Community Development Councils (CDCs), District Development Assemblies (DDAs), and project beneficiaries, are involved in the project management cycle. This includes initiation, planning, implementation, monitoring, and closing phases to promote sustainability and ensure an efficient exit strategy. It also helps to establish local ownership of project interventions. Despite the challenging circumstances in Afghanistan, ACDO has delivered humanitarian and development assistance in several provinces, including Nangarhar, Herat, Balkh, Kabul, Kandahar, Bamyan, Wardak, Jouzjan, Paktia, Kunduz, Takhar, Laghman, Daykundi, and Farah during the past seven years. ACDO always adheres to the four fundamental humanitarian principles of independence, neutrality, and impartiality. [ii]  [2][i]  Asia Community development org.

Afghanistan has one of the lowest literacy proficiency rates in the world, with over 12 million adults being illiterate. Although formal education has gradually improved, the literacy rate among adults remains at 34.8%, with vulnerable groups especially excluded. Only 24% of women are literate compared to 52% of men. As a result, 4.2 million learners in the priority group (aged 15-35) urgently need youth and adult literacy and primary education, including pre-vocational skills training. These vulnerabilities have been further exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19 and the political transition that took place in August 2021.  ACDO has partnered with AABRAR Support to improve education in Laghman province, Afghanistan's Dawlatshah, Alishang, and Alingar districts. The main goal is to provide education to 3710 boys and girls, with an emphasis on promoting education and gender equality by enrolling 73% of girls. The project involves the establishment of 106 learning centers and the recruitment of 111 qualified teachers. These teachers underwent a 14-day training program that covered topics such as core pedagogy, classroom management, child safeguarding, child protection, psychosocial support (PSS), social and emotional learning (SEL), protection against exploitation and abuse (PSEA), inclusive education. They were also trained in child-centred protective and interactive methodologies, the characteristics of a good teacher and their responsibilities, different teaching methods, types of plans, lessons, and supporting materials, and classroom management.  The project also includes the establishment of 48 School Management Councils (Shuras) (SMC) and training and coordination meetings with relevant stakeholders. Additionally, minor rehabilitation of 106 classes will be carried out as part of this initiative. This partnership is a strategic move towards advancing education in the region and ensuring a brighter future for the children of Afghanistan. Moreover, The project will positively impact 3,710 girls and boys, 111 teachers, 15 staff members directly and an estimated 26,432 people indirectly. Its main aim is to increase literacy rates, create awareness about the importance of education, and contribute to the development of more robust and informed communities. The direct beneficiaries will have access to quality education and the necessary resources to excel in their studies, while the project will provide a stable source of income to more than 120 people, with an average of seven members of families. UNICEF is providing financial support for this initiative, and ACDO is receiving regular guidance and instruction from them to ensure its successful implementation. [i]  [4]Basic General Literacy Program - BGL : The Basic General Literacy (BGL) project began in October 2022 and will conclude in October 2023. The Asia Community Development Organization (ACDO) is responsible for implementing the project to provide quality education to youth and adult individuals in need. Beneficiaries of the project will receive learning materials, including classroom and student hygiene kits, winterization supplies, and learning kits for students. In addition, teachers will receive training aligned with BGL standards, policies, and Literacy Cluster requirements to ensure their capacity to provide inclusive and gender-sensitive education. [ii]  [2]  In addition, ACDO has undertaken several notable projects, including the ""Providing Emergency Assistance and Community-based Education (PEACE) project"" in Takhar province. This project has profoundly impacted the community by providing educational opportunities to 3,000 girls and boys, thereby increasing literacy rates. It has brought about a brighter future for the children and families in the target area, and its positive ripple effect will be felt for generations to come.  ACDO is currently implementing the Basic General Literacy Program, funded by UNESCO, in three provinces of Afghanistan - Samangan, Parwan, and Paktika. The program aims to establish 267 BGL classes in a total of 16 districts in these provinces, catering to 4000 youth and adults over the age of 15 years old. The program is community-based, with a focus on maximizing community outreach and responsiveness. The ultimate goal of this project is to improve adult literacy rates from 34.8% to at least 40%, especially among women and girls, thereby supporting SDG 4.6 targets. Through this intervention, ACDO aims to increase the quality, equity, and inclusiveness of education and literacy opportunities for Afghan youth and adults.Humanitarian and Emergency Response:  To effectively and transparently provide humanitarian assistance to vulnerable people in Afghanistan through long-term interventions.Development and long-term interventions:  To effectively assist vulnerable populations in Afghanistan by creating sustainable, self-sufficient communities with ample opportunities for social engagement, recreation, and a high standard of living.

(2022):  https://acdo-af.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ACDO-2022-Annual-Report.pdfAnalysis and Lessons Learned  ACDO has accomplished numerous milestones by promoting education, literacy, humanitarian activities, and facilitating employment opportunities through various community programs. The organization has established an internship program to enhance the capacity of its employees and new graduates. In 2022, ACDO provided soft skills training for 11 interns. Additionally, the organization has trained and skilled more than 450 community and school shura members in dealing with their children and community members.  In addition, all project activities proceeded smoothly without significant challenges, except for the ban on women. ACDO firmly believes that transparent, safe, impartial, and non-discriminatory humanitarian and development aid is only possible with the participation of women in national and international NGOs. Women's full involvement in all aspects of aid delivery is a principled response and essential for operational effectiveness. The ban on women will have devastating consequences for men, boys, women, and girls in Afghanistan. ACDO, along with all other I/NGOs, demands the immediate and complete revocation of this order. If the ban is not lifted, it will have a catastrophic impact on the provision of assistance to millions of Afghans in urgent need of support, and it will contribute to an increase in the number of people in need.

They aim to provide advocacy, training, psycho-social support, legal assistance, and sheltering services. POWA is also involved in law and policy reform, research, campaigning, and regional and international strategic engagement [1] . Through its aims, it redefines its mission by improving the quality of life for all women and girls and cultivating a society that is secure and egalitarian, one that is intolerant of any violence against women and girls, a culture in which women and girls are treated with respect and dignity, and in which their rights are advanced [2] .  Origins and Development  POWA, founded in the Gauteng Province in 1979by a committed group of female volunteers, arose in response to the pressing necessity for an organisation capable of furnishing sanctuary and essential services to women who were victims of domestic violence [3] . POWA evolved in tandem with the nation's substantial political and social changes. Operating for 44 years, they have expanded their focus to encompass the promotion of social transformation, education, policy reforms, and women's empowerment.  [4]  This analysis pertains to the transition of South Africa from the Apartheid regime to a democratic one, where it considers how POWA aligned its objectives with the principles of democracy.  Further, POWA was the first organisation to establish a shelter for abused women in 1981 and pioneered second-stage (or transitional) housing for women in 2009 in Gauteng [5] . POWA built the capacity of emerging organisations in all nine provinces, leading to better access for women from rural and under-resourced areas. They have ensured more significant access to justice and legal services for women. They have achieved awards ‘Jozi Award Community Development (2015)’, ‘Gauteng Department of Social Development MEC Mazibuko:Gauteng Care Givers (2015)', and ‘In recognition of women for making a difference by contributing positively towards moving Gauteng City Region Forward Human Rights &amp; Democracy: Gender Equality Award Organisational category (2004) [6] . Further, POWA has contributed to the law–making process around the Domestic Violence Act and the Sexual Offences Act, monitoring the implementation of these laws [7] . POWA’s legal manager at the time, Wendy Isaack, also commented on the review ofState Institutions Supporting Constitutional Democracy, where she conducted critical findings along with recommendations and sent it to Prof. A. K Asmal, the chairperson of the study [8] . Through the provision of comments and the presentation of significant conclusions together with suggestions, she actively participated in the deliberative process, assuring the inclusion of civil society opinions and insights in the review. Finally, POWA ensured women's economic independence by providing skills development and income generation infrastructure [9] . Today, POWA has six branches throughout the province, providing education, counselling, legal services, and shelter. They also have two communal shelters and one second-stage housing as an alternative place of safety [10] . Finally, POWA actively advocates to ensure the realisation of women’s rights, ultimately improving women’s quality of life [11] .Organisational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Considering the organisational structure, POWA is a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) [12] , and as an NGO, it acts independently of government entities. POWA follows a pyramid organisational structure, with 11 members on the board to ensure the smooth sailing of the organisation. The committee comprises a Chairperson, Deputy Chairperson, Treasurer, Director, Executive Director and six other members [13] . That being said, the organisational structure would mean little if there was no membership aspect since membership promotes collaboration, awareness, and the talents and networks of committed NGO supporters, helping many organisations achieve their aims and develop a robust and supportive community. Hence, POWA’s membership and volunteer network is not limited to its staff or victims and is open to anyone who supports the cause, as this will allow for a more significant impact.  Finally, as an NGO, POWA relies heavily on funding.Funding provides resources to finance a need, program, or project (Cambridge Dictionary) [14] . While this is usually in the form of money, it can also take the form of effort or time from an organisation or company, known as in-kind funding [15] . POWA received funding in both the abovementioned ways, monetary and in-kind donations. To begin, there was a 1.6bl government grant established last year to combat gender-based violence; however, POWA, as one of the civil society organisations, has yet to receive any money from that grant [16] . This did not, however, take away from the fact that POWA has received immense support, considering its vast number of partners and collaborations, donors, and volunteers.Partners and Collaborations :  First,  House of Busby , On April 27, 2016, Guess Jeans were sold at a 10% discount in support of violence against women. POWA received the10% sales proceedsto help survivors and their children residing at POWA’s places of safety. Women and girls were asked to contribute their Guess jeans to the charity. POWA received 254 pairs of jeans on May 27, 2016, where the jeans were distributed to shelter survivors and other jeans were sold to workers and the general public to raise revenue for the shelter. To date, the proceeds from the sales total R 5 290.00 (POWA, n.d) [17] .  Next is  iLearn , which played a vital part in empowering 20 survivors by giving online computer training classes for a year [18] .  Then,  L'Oréal,  where POWA was awarded a trial collaboration initiative in 2016 by L'Oréal Professional African Salon Institute, in which five survivors received scholarships to study Hair Care for eight months [19] .The course was R50000 for each woman, which included tuition and equipment.The women werealso given R1000 in transportation each month [20] .Many survivors, particularly those housed in POWA shelters, are untrained and unemployed.Another element that keeps women in abusive relationships is financial dependency on the abusive partner. The initiative is a significant step towards empowering survivors to end the cycle of violence.The L'Oréal coursepromises women employment placements and the opportunity to create hair care enterprises. The project also allows survivors to coach others who will enter the programme after the initial group finishes the course. [ 21] A more recent contribution was a campaign launched by L’Oréal Paris, whichcollaborated with 12 female social media influencers. These influencers contributed their perspectives and opinions to the collective effort aimed at addressing and combating the prevalent issue of gender-based violence in South Africa [22] . The female individuals further endorse the L’Oréal Paris Rouge Signature EmpoweRED lipstick collection and L’Oréal Paris Revitalift Red Cream since a percentage of the proceeds generated in August will support POWA.  Then,  Joe Public Johannesburg  uses innovative newspaper advertising to raise awareness about the frequency of domestic abuse in South Africa as well as the works of POWA. “POWA TAKES OVER TV NEWS TO BREAK THE SILENCE AROUND GBV [23] ” and “THE NEWS YOU NEED TO SEE [24] ” are only two of the articles posted on Joe Public where the works of POWA are shared and the voices of victims are heard.  Finally, POWA partnered with the  Mzansi Women's Film Festival  to screen the moving film ""Alison"" at Constitutional Hill, presenting stories of perseverance and hope [25] .DonorsAs per POWA’s website, they have 13 donors, namelyMary Oppenheimer and Daughters Foundation, Suzan Stehlik Charitable Trust fund SA, Werksmans attorneys, Oxfam SA, Legal&amp;Tax, Social Development Funds, Eskom, Avon, Absa, Cliffe, Dekker Hofmeyr, Comic Relief, Wiphold, Lottery andAvon Justine and if that weren’t enough they too have a tab on their website where volunteers can donate to the cause [ 26].VolunteersPOWA’s website has a donation tab where anyone who wants to support the cause may donate. They also have barcodes that can be scanned, namely, SnapScan and Zapper, through which anyone can contribute.Specialisations, Methods and Tools  POWA covers a range of specialised domains, each of which is committed to resolving the issue of gender-based violence. The specialisations are aligned with thedepartments established within POWA's organisational structure. The Clinical Departmentfocuses on providing specialised clinical services. Qualified social workers and social auxiliary workers oversee this department's various programmes and activities. The legal and advocacy section focuses on providing technical legal advice and engaging in advocacy efforts.POWA offers direct legal assistance to those who have experienced sexual assault and intimate partner abuse. This assistance includes court support and preparations for legal proceedings. Over time, trained volunteershave provided aid to several individuals who have experienced domestic abuse. This assistance has encompassed various aspects, including facilitating the process of obtaining Protection Orders per the Domestic Abuse Act 116 of 1998 and educating women about their entitlements and available legal remedies [27] . In addition, POWA provides educational rights to many entities, including schools, communities, the South African Police Services (SAPS), the Ekurhuleni Metro Police, and other institutions about legislation such as the Domestic Violence Act, Customary Marriage Act, Sexual Violence Act, and the Domestic Partnership Act [28] . Furthermore, POWA's legal services branch actively establishes networks and cultivatesalliances. The research training and development department focuses on specialised initiatives to facilitate women's advancement, explicitly focusing on enhancing their empowerment and knowledge. Significant projects and events exemplify these endeavours.  The specialisations above are discerned by considering POWA's methodologies and tools, as they believe there is no singular pathway to effect change. Consequently, they consistently strive to explore novel and innovative techniques within their programming endeavours to attain the desired transformation. The approaches and instruments that closely correspond to participatory democracy encompass lobbying, outreach and media assistance, training and development, and feminist research and knowledge generation.Major Projects and Events  POWA takes a holistic strategy to address gender-based violence through a few significant projects. (1) RaisingHer Voice: Despite recent advancements in women's political leadership in South Africa, there is a persistent and escalating prevalence of violence against women [29] . The adverse effects of HIV and AIDS, as well as poverty, on women are significantly disproportionate [30] . By integrating grassroots awareness-raising and action with lobbying and advocacy efforts at both national and regional levels, the Raising Her Voice initiative contributes to transforming societal attitudes and behaviours. Additionally, it plays a crucial role in holding the government accountable for its pledge to adopt and enforce the African Women's Rights Protocol [31] .(2) Teenz Alliance: with this initiative,POWA engages with ADAPT  [1]  to combat sexual assault in South African schools. By offering leadership training, advocacy campaigns, and access tosexual violence treatment, this project empowers both boys and girls. POWA actively interacts with young generations to confront this severe subject by addressing sexual assault in schools and fostering a sense of equality and respect amongst students [32] . (3) Add Your Voice to #EndDomesticSilence: POWA created thiscampaign in collaboration with JOKO  [2]  to shatter the quiet around domestic abuse in South Africa. This project urges South Africans to raise their voices to support critical measures combating gender-based violence [33] . The campaign increases awareness, eliminates the stigma associated with survivors, and calls attention to the essential need to prevent domestic violence by elevating victim tales and creating discussions [34] .  Through these projects and events, POWA aims to focus on capacity-building and training regarding empowering individuals with the knowledge and skills to address violence against women. By providing training opportunities, POWA actively involves community members becoming advocates, leaders, and service providers. This aligns with the democratic principle of informed and engaged citizens driving positive change. Overall, POWA's projects also actively involve citizens, survivors, and communities in addressing gender-based violence, fostering dialogue, and advocating for policy changes. These projects recognise that meaningful change occurs when individuals and communities actively engage in the decision-making processes and advocate for their rights and the rights of others.[1]  ADAPT is a non-profit organisation that was founded in 1994 to provide therapy and support services to abused women, men, children, and older people in South Africa.[2]  JOKO is a South African tea company known for its social mission to combat domestic violence by leveraging the power of conversations and promoting awareness and support for survivors of abuse.Analysis and Lessons LearnedThe survivor-centred approach is a theoretical framework and operational methodology that places utmost importance on addressing the needs, perspectives, and agency of those who have endured traumatic or detrimental circumstances, such as instances of gender-based violence or abuse. That being said, the innovative study conducted by Goodman and Epstein focuses on the survivor-centred approach, which represents a paradigm shift in the understanding and treatment of domestic violence. The survivor-centred method is applied through confidentiality, safety, respect, and non-discrimination. The hypothesis proposed by the authors extends beyond conventional paradigms and acknowledges the resilience and agency exhibited by individuals who have experienced adversity [35] . At the core of their methodology is the notion that individuals who have experienced trauma should have an active role in their journey towards healing and restoration. The authors emphasise the critical significance of actively engaging in attentive listening to the perspectives of women who have experienced domestic violence, comprehended their distinct encounters, and enabled them to exercise agency in making choices that promote their overall welfare [36] . The work conducted by Goodman and Epstein carries significant implications for the domains of advocacy, mental health care, and the endeavour to achieve justice for survivors. The phenomenon has generated a substantial change in perspective, leading to a greater emphasis on empathy and efficacy in addressing domestic violence. This shift recognises the resilience and expertise of survivors, so promoting a survivor-centred approach in this vital domain of societal interest.  The adoption of a survivor-centred strategy by POWA not only demonstrates its effectiveness but also represents a pioneering effort in advancing participatory democracy in the realm of combating gender-based violence. Through the use of strategies aimed at empowering survivors, such as affording them a platform to express their experiences, as well as actively incorporating them in the formulation of the organisation's programmes, POWA has successfully encouraged citizen involvement and enhanced the representation of those impacted by acts of violence. This strategy is by the tenets of participatory democracy, which advocates for the active participation of citizens in making decisions that directly influence their lives. POWA has effectively established an inclusive atmosphere wherein survivors, in conjunction with community members and activists, assume a crucial role in the discourse around gender-based violence, therefore fostering democratic engagement and amplifying the voices of marginalised persons. However, the ongoing prevalence of gender-based violence in South Africa highlights the intricate nature of the problem. Despite the significant progress made by POWA, the ultimate achievement of their objectives relies on the entire elimination of violence targeting women and girls. Hence, POWA serves as both a triumph narrative and a representation of the continuous endeavour to establish a community that rejects such acts of violence that are founded upon principles of participatory democracy and the empowerment of survivors.

12890,organization,Violence Prevention through Urban Upgrading ,https://participedia.net/organization/12890,"The Violence Prevention through Upgrading (VPUU) is an organization that was initially formed to encounter the pervasive violence in Cape Town township with its formation staring in Khayelitsha. However, the organization addresses a wide range of issues in poor communities looking to innovate and advance the development of these areas through meaningful interaction with the affected communities and other involved stakeholders.",0,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,4062406,"""2023-10-29 21:28:43""",https://participedia.net/user/4062406,4062406,"""2023-10-30 21:05:04""",https://participedia.net/user/4062406,en,,,Cape Town,Western Cape,,South Africa,-34.0378253,18.6798895,non_profit_non_gov,,,,collaborative, community, direct,facilitate, legislation, inform,sustainable, public_participation, youth_issues,law, planning, health,," Mission and Purpose  The VPUU through its programs it regards social cohesion and social capital as significantly central to its approach.[1] This means that their programs promote solidarity and positive working relationship between citizens of the affected areas, the local government, the community-based organizations, and other bodies interested in the partnership for the development of the poor communities. The aim of the organization is to facilitate equal participation in the development of poor communities without being affiliated to political party patronage. 1  The VPUU shows no indication of any political affiliation, but outside influence cannot be totally ruled out as those might come through the funders or any bodies of power within the partnerships. Due to solidarity of the stakeholders and positive working relationship developed, ''the VPUU political approach allows it to achieve community trust in circumstances of high political contestation and anger of the communities the government for the lack of service delivery pervasive in Khayelitsha''. 1  Their strategic approach is crucial because it encompasses diverse and different bodies operating at different levels from local to international, and they include citizens in their decision-making and that to some extent is appealing to citizens as compared to how the government tends to operate.    Further, the intent and goal of the VPUU programs is to achieve a demonstrable and sustainable increase in the safety of the residential population. [2]Its programs are mandated to make significant evident changes and improvements in these communities and those are designed and implemented with the goal of longevity and reliable adequacy of standards. 3  However, outcomes of the interventions do not guarantee with certainty the quality and longevity of the results from the projects but to an extent it guarantees there will most likely be interventions taking place in affected communities or areas of focus. In addition, the VPUU projects are not state driven as they advocate for citizens to be at the center of the programs and mobilizing community-based groups to monitor and ensure that the community actively participate in securing their rights. 2[1]  Barolsky, V.

Survey Methodology in Violence-prone Khayelitsha, Cape Town, South Africa. IDS Bulletin. Vol. 40. No, 3. Blackwell Publishing Ltd.Origins and Development  In the South African democratic state, townships have been suffering great social, economic, and cultural issues but more prominently unemployment, poor infrastructure, high crime rate to name few. This led to the VPUU founders identifying the gap and saw the need to create safer and sustainable communities as a proactive response to the high levels of direct violence and crime in Cape Town. 3  The project of the VPUU was established around 2005 in Harare Khayelitsha and the main areas of focus at the start of the project was Harare, Site C and Kuyasa respectively. 2  To provide context of Khayelitsha, it is a large township with predominantly informal settlements located approximately 30 kilometers south-east of Cape Town, and was formed in 1983 as primarily formal settlements that was meant to accommodate the overcrowding in Crossroad, Nyanga, Langa, and Gugulethu which are also large townships of Cape Town. 4  The township of Khayelitsha is well known to be crime ridden and poor to non-existent road infrastructure and other social services, 5  and all these challenges in Khayelitsha motivated the establishment of the VPUU programs to work with communities to encounter the challenges they face daily.  Therefore, the establishment of the VPUU was made possible by a range of different stakeholders which includes the City of Cape Town, the German Development Bank, the Khayelitsha Community, the SAPS, ward councilors, ward committees, approximately 28 non-government organizations, Western Cape Government, the Khayelitsha Development Forum, the National Treasury, the University of the Western Cape, University of Cape Town, the Legal Aid Clinic of the Western Cape, and many other interested stakeholders. 2  The validity of these stakeholders is given by the notion that some of these stakeholders are mentioned by the VPUU websites, even though the totality of the stakeholders involved is not clearly given. Moreover, the partners or stakeholders of the VPUU further established the VPUU Not for Profit Company (VPUU NPC) which was to oversee the running of the programs and facilitate better communications and interventions between the stakeholders. 3Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The success of the programs or events and operations of the VPUU is dependent on the efficiency of the working relationships formed and it is also attributed to the various partnerships between the stakeholders. In conducting the operations of the programs, the VPUU engage with citizen leadership and stakeholders in meetings with citizens taking partial control of the operations and the VPUU playing a supporting role along with other partners. 1  This is supported by Cloete (2012) who argues that the VPUU has a program of gathering different stakeholders of different levels and engage them regarding community development and discuss what is best for the community in negotiated development. 2  The VPUU programs are mostly ongoing projects which can be regarded as processes that progresses the needs of the communities and improve the services they receive.  The VPUU conducts its programs under different and nine areas of expertise, with six of these considered as content specific and they include the Area Based Management (ABM), Co-Design for Spatial Justice (CDSJ), Early Childhood Development for All (ECD4ALL), Local Economic Development for All (LED Broker), Information and Communications Technology for Development (ICT4D), and the Training and Development (T&amp;D).[3] The other three areas of expertise are more of processes, they are crosscutting in their operations, and these include Community Participation (CP), Project Management (PM), Monitoring (MEL). There is also within the VPUU, the Executive Support Services, which includes Office Management, Information Technology, Human Resources, and Finance &amp; Marketing departments that complete the areas of operation in the VPUU. 3Moreover, the VPUU programs and operations are co-funded by the Federal German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, the City of Cape Town, National Treasury, and together with other public and third-party funding. [3]Barolsky (2016) argues that the initial financial agreement between the German Development Bank and the City of Cape Town stipulated that a project-implementing agent or intermediary known as the VPUU Consortium should implement the intervention led by a team of consultants from Sun Development Pty Ltd, which is a subsidiary of a company heard-quartered in German. 1[3]  http://vpuu.ac.za1  Barolsky, V. (2016). Is social cohesion relevant to a city in the global south? A case of Khayelitsha township.6  Okurut, K. Kulabako, R. N. Chenoweth, J. &amp; Charles, K. (2015). Assessing demand for improved sustainable sanitation in low-income informal settlements of urban areas: a critical review. International Journal of Environmental Health.Specializations, Methods and Tools  The VPUU typically initiates and look to address the issues affecting citizens by seeking their involvement in the projects, and the community can also initiate the area it would like the VPUU to assist in addressing. 3  This, therefore, means that any stakeholder can initiate the programs and seek inputs and support of the other stakeholders, and the VPUU in some cases provides training workshops if the program requires citizens to have the skill sets for a particular program. Barolsky (2016) argues that one of the key citizen engagement tools that the VPUU uses is baseline surveys, which the organization discursively constructs as giving a voice to ordinary citizens through a random sample. 1Major Projects and Events  The challenges of poor service delivery in townships of Cape Town with its fast-growing informal settlements is a challenge the local government is struggling to maintain. The event in this work will focus on the challenges of poor sanitation and the inadequate service delivery in informal settlements of Khayelitsha. The event or project studied in this work is the City Spec Mobile Inspection Tool for Improving Service Delivery in informal settlements of Monwabisi in Khayelitsha, and the program was developed by the VPUU, the City of Cape Town and other stakeholders involved.  CitySpec: A Mobile Inspection Tool Improving Service DeliveryFormula D_: CitySpec Mobile Inspection Tool.  The struggle for informal settlements to receive adequate service delivery is an issue that invites meaningful engagement on how to minimize poor service delivery. And informal settlements are defined as residential areas situated on illegally occupied land or where housing is not in compliance with planning and building regulations. 6  The VPUU therefore, working with the community members and other interested stakeholders developed a City Spec Mobile App program in Khayelitsha, and this is a mobile inspection tool that looks to identify service delivery faults for improving essential services in informal settlements. 3  According to the VPUU website their aim for developing this program was to get authentic evidence of the service faults in the affected area, by deploying members of the community to gather the evidence. 3  The accuracy of this mobile app is validated by a VPUU program facilitator, who acknowledges that the city spec make reporting faults easy as the move from paper to technological reports goes straight to the municipality system and there is no errors of misinformation capturing and immediately receive response through email about the repair process. 10  This is significant in revealing the effectiveness of this project and how it has helped improve service delivery using the community and with the community responding positively to the change made by the city spec. As it is reported that in 2011 about 40% of 177 communal taps were faulty and a fault report was sent resulting in the Water and Sanitation Department repairing and seeking to increase functionality of the services to 90%. 10Formula D_: Facilitator Training Community MembersFormula D_: VPUU CitySpec Facilitator (Thulani Manci).  The people using the mobile app are community members trained in established workshops or training programs for efficient and effective participation on solving service delivery challenges. 3  Despite the VPUU website failing to explain the criteria for selection, but an individual within the project reveled that those volunteering community members are taken and trained. 10  It is said that the city spec mobile app monitored a wide range of services including water taps, toilets, streetlights, and other services, and has different alert codes for different faults and these are reported to the city. 3  The wide range of services covered by the city spec makes it imperative for solid communication between citizens and government, however, it does not guarantee that all reported faults will be attended and delivered adequately on a constant basis. The VPUU website also states that the fault reports are uploaded as picture attachment to an online database and the City of Cape Town takes charge of monitoring and repairing the faults using GPS for location areas and type of service reported. 3  In addition, the City of Cape Town had a similar project where it developed a GPS coordinate to enable repair teams to easily locate the toilets after faults reports by the community, and that resulted to 256 toilets in Khayelitsha in November of 2011 repaired and hundreds of doors and missing manhole covers replaced and raised others to prevent sewerage holes. 7Formula D_: Community Members Capturing FaultsFormula D_: Community Member Capturing FaultsFormula D_: Informal Settlements of Monwabisi6  Okurut, K.

Analysis and Lessons Learned  In the analysis of the City Spec project, the theory that will be used is the Participatory Democracy in an Age of Inequality by Decombe and Parvin. This theory is significant for the study because it explains how participatory democracy make ordinary people the centre of engagement and decision-making. It further explains the significance of citizen involvement in budgetary meetings, and this contributes to the development of citizen’s awareness, capacity of knowledge, and development of citizens to effectively participation giving democracy legitimacy by also holding the government officials accountable. 8Therefore, the establishment of the City Spec by the VPUU initially signify a sense of democracy because the project was brought to life by the coming together of different stakeholders deliberating how the project will operate and these includes the City of Cape Town, the German Development Bank, the community of Khayelitsha, community-based organizations and other stakeholders. Despite full participation of the different stakeholders involved it does not mean the effectiveness of their participation is equal, with the level of their financial contribution to the program being unequal. Since the centrality of this project is to place citizens at the centre of operations, Mugwaneza (2019) argues that public participation is based on the belief that the people affected by a decision have a right to be involved in the decision-making processes, and this includes the importance of their contribution influencing decisions. 9  Therefore, the VPUU project by involving community members in decision-making sessions or meetings and providing them with skills and knowledge of the mobile app through development workshop, it is exercising participatory democracy. This is significant with regards to the theory because through citizens direct involvement in the program using the mobile app, it also provides them with adequate information to hold the government to account and participate meaningfully in decision-making, resulting in legitimate and effective governance.  Unlike the GPS coordinates developed by the City of Cape Town which revealed the results of their project, it has been difficult to get information with regards to the success of the programs in the long run and how ordinary community members affected received the project as the community members involved in capturing fault report spoke highly of the cityspec program. This is to mean the sustainability of the program has not been identified in this work and the views of the people in Monwabisi other than those involved in the program. In the participatory democratic theory, Decombe and Parvin (2019) argue that opening democracy to a plurality of voices in this way might lead to tangible benefits in the quality of democratic decision-making. 8  This, however, is not a given that all who participate or given an opportunity to participate in decisions is reflective of their impact in decisions. It rather suggests that all participation of different stakeholders is welcomed but decisions of stakeholders holding higher power can easily overpower or suppress to an extent the decisions of the other stakeholders. Even though there is no evidence found that show to be the case in the running or operations of the cityspec program. This leave leaves Piper cited in Barolsky (2016) arguing that the community consultation that the VPUU engages in and the forums it creates is designed in ways that allows for very limited form of direct citizen participation in democratic decision-making. 1Therefore, the analysis of the cityspec program in Monwabisi informal settlements of Khayelitsha has revealed that the participation of community members in decision-making does exist to some extent and that the program is centered around citizen participation. That is because community volunteers trained to use the mobile monitor cellphone are directly involved in alerting the city and the department of water and sanitation about the service delivery faults and these stakeholders directly report back to the community volunteers about the plans to resolve and repair the services found with faults. However, the participation of the community members in direct decision-making and their effectiveness in not explicitly revealed even though it has been shown that they do participate. In addition, the VPUU signify high levels of democracy since community members not only participate in decisions but are provided with information to hold the government officials to account and that maximizes high level of transparency to an extent.9  Mugwaneza, B.

The organization has helped numerous newcomers from various world regions, including Central Asia, the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, Eastern Europe, and Africa, in their initial settlement process. These early steps, such as finding a place to live, job opportunities, learning English, and becoming familiar with Canada's legal system and health care, are all vital to establishing a solid foundation for each newcomer to create a healthy life in Canada. Furthermore, AWO programming includes a variety of activities that cater to the evolving needs of newcomers. As a result, more women and their families have better access to their network of peers and increased involvement in their communities.[i][1]The mission of AWO is to assist refugees and immigrants, especially those who have been affected by wars and persecution, with a special emphasis on women and their families. The organization strives to enhance their quality of life and promote their social and economic integration, enabling them to become active members of society and live with dignity.  [ii][2][i]  AWO official Website page:  https://afghanwomen.org/about-us/[ii]  AWO official Website page:  https://afghanwomen.org/about-us/mission-and-values/Origins and DevelopmentThe AWO had modest beginnings in 1990. It was founded by Adeena Niaizi, who, along with a few Afghan refugee women, initially ran the organization on a volunteer basis. The group was formed by like-minded women from the Afghan committee with the aim of supporting other Afghan women refugees. They started in a small office without any furniture. Fahima Fatah was the first official staff member of AWO and worked with a second-hand typewriter at a small desk. Despite the small office and limited resources, the group worked tirelessly to help more Afghan women and their families. They came together with a shared goal to make a positive impact in the lives of those who needed it the most. Meanwhile, The AWO operates like a tight-knit family, with its clients at the center of its extended family. As the organization grew, it began serving an increasingly diverse client base. The AWO's mission is to improve the quality of life for newcomers and refugees, helping them live with dignity and reach their full potential while promoting social and economic inclusion. The organization has successfully served over 19,000 clients who have experienced war and violence from countries such as Afghanistan, Iran, other Central Asian countries, the Middle East, South and East Asia, Africa, and Europe.  [i][1][i]  AWO official Website page:  https://afghanwomen.org/about-us/Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingThe administrative structure of AWO comprises the founder, Vice President, treasurer, secretary, and staff members. In addition, AWO's funders include the Community Foundation of Mississauga, Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada, Ontario Trillium Foundation, Region of Peel, RBC Royal Bank, United Way, and Scotia Bank.Members of AWO will receive several benefits, including a membership card that is valid for one year, the right to vote in AWO elections, and the eligibility to be nominated for the AWO Board of Directors.

Please help us complete it.Major Projects and Events·Settlement ServicesThe Settlement Services Program of AWO assists more than 100 newly arrived landed immigrants and convention refugees every month to settle and integrate into Canadian society. Newcomers often find it challenging to access basic services such as health care, transportation, education, employment and shelter due to language barriers and lack of knowledge about the settlement process. However, AWO Settlement Services staff is well-trained and equipped to cater to their special needs. It offers a wide range of settlement services for families, including one-on-one services, information and orientation, interpretation and translation, assistance in filling forms and applying for benefits like SIN, PRC, CCTB, OHIP, assistance in finding housing (rentals and applying for subsidized housing), school/language training referral and enrollment, supportive counselling, accompaniment, follow-ups and referrals.·Needs AssessmentAs a part of the settlement and adaptation process, the first step is a needs assessment meeting. During this meeting, newcomers are informed about their rights and responsibilities as permanent residents in Canada. They are also provided with information about all the required documentation to access health care, employment and training opportunities, programs and education for their children, and the various services offered by the AWO to assist with the settlement process.·Youth ProgramOver the past year, the Youth Program of the Afghan Women’s Organization has been highly successful in catering to the needs of immigrant and refugee youth. The program aims to empower and support youth in various aspects of their lives and provides them with various services. These services include settlement services, mentorship, and civic engagement programs. Additionally, the program offers supportive and solution-oriented counselling to newcomer youth, which helps reduce social isolation and encourages them to participate in the wider community. The program has also provided assistance and counselling to several at-risk youths, including referrals to lawyers, support with court and school issues, and Aggression Replacement Training. Many youth have benefitted from the program, learning valuable skills in conflict mediation, which has helped them integrate into the wider community. Furthermore, the program offers skill development workshops that assist youth in developing leadership and public speaking skills, as well as empowering them with knowledge. The program also promotes awareness of Canadian culture and society among these youth.  [i]Moreover, The AWO offers various programs, including Global Connections, Let's Talk Not Hide, Women and Family Support Services, Senior Program, Mental Health and Wellness, Refugee Services, Community Connections, Employment Services, and English Language Classes.  [ii][4]The Job Search Workshops (JSW) offered by AWO are helpful for newcomers trying to determine their career paths and next steps. The program has been running successfully from 2014 to 2015 and has already assisted 195 clients. The program helps newcomers think through their long-term and short-term career goals and supports them through the initial job preparation process into a life-long process of skill-building and career development. It offers computer training classes and access to the computer lab while providing ongoing support. Clients are referred to schools and language services, Employment Ontario programs, career fairs, employment agencies, and apprenticeship programs to obtain their licenses in various trades and skill training. The program also helps foreign professionals by referring them to credential evaluation services. Clients are assisted in creating their resumes and receive follow-up services to assess their progress. They benefit from ongoing access to Internet services, photocopying, and the use of a fax machine. The AWO wishes all of its JSW participants great success in 2015.

More specifically, the organization aims to empower ordinary citizens to engage in respectful dialogue with those of opposing views, thus enabling individuals to garner a more significant understanding of pressing political issues with the hopes of reaching common ground. Through respectful dialogue and consideration of different political opinions, Living Room Conversations fosters more harmonious communities and empathetic individuals.  Describing the benefits of civil dialogue,  founders of Living Room Conversations identified the purpose of the discussion  format and creation of the organization, writing, “Besides having the time and  structure to listen and reflect, specific aspects of Living Room Conversations  help to counter stereotypes and enlarge our tribes. For example, it is easier  to interrupt stereotypes when we encounter counter-stereotype information and  have the time to process it” [1]. By  providing a structured format for conversation, Living Room Conversations  allows individuals to actively listen to others and share their own opinions  within a safe, controlled setting. The organization offers citizens a platform  and tool to not only build greater understanding but also build meaningful and  mutually respectful relationships. This mission of counteracting the growing  polarization from political affiliations in the United States seeks to  encourage a more respectful, civil society based on intercommunal and  intracommunal conversations. The organization's name originates from the idea  that living rooms are often considered a place of gathering and socializing.  When a person receives an invite into someone else’s home, they generally feel  respected and valued, promoting respectful conversation [2]. While the living room is assumed to be a physical  location, modern technology allows people to connect with others through  virtual platforms. With these new forms of communication, Living Room  Conversations can build communities of understanding and growth both in-person  and online, transforming the typical definition of “living room.”  Origins and Development  Founded in 2010, Living Room Conversations is a non-profit organization which promotes healthy dialogue and political discussion. The organization’s founders, noting the lack of civil dialogue on political problems and increasing polarization in American culture, sought to use simple, structured conversations to build empathy and understanding. The founding members believed that while disagreement is inevitable, this disagreement should not lead to hopeless divides. Instead, Living Room Conversations sought to harness these fundamental differences to empower community members to seek better solutions in difficult circumstances. Moreover, founder Joan Blades teamed up with other dialogue experts to “create a structured, intimate conversation format that would  empower everyday citizens to discuss important issues with friends of differing  political affiliations and backgrounds”  [3]. They believed that if individuals engaged in a discussion where the intent and structure were disclosed, the dialogue would produce an atmosphere founded on respect and worthwhile transmission of ideas. Additionally, this personal, conversational format could breed new, long-lasting relationships amongst participants and encourage further discussion between dissenting individuals. By early 2011, the tested format of Living Room Conversations proved to succeed in creating more respectful, understanding dialogue surrounding controversial topics.  Following the pilot's success, Joan Blades  and Amanda Kathryn Roman joined forces to form a partnership and continue to  promote the mission of Living Room Conversations. They hired an advisory board  and established a website to launch Living Room Conversations, creating an  accessible format for individuals, small groups, and larger organizations. The  platform attracted its first notable conversation in 2013. This discussion was  co-hosted by Joan Blades and Mark Meckler, co-founder of the Tea Party  Patriots, finding common ground on controversial issues such as criminal  justice reform and the harms of capitalism. Moreover, Living Room Conversations constantly adapts and expands,  introducing new topics and partnering with new organizations. Particularly, the  ability to conduct Living Room Conversations through online formats as well as  in-person events allows the organization to collaborate with more participants  in new ways, bridging divides between people from all areas of the United  States [5].  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Living Room Conversations structures itself around a core team, which is composed of executive directors, administrative managers, community engagement directors, and other organizational staff. These staff members run the administrative and outreach sides of the organization, coordinating with outside organizations and events to bring the Living Room Conversations to them. Positions include Community Engagement Partner, Youth Council Leader, Social Media Manager, Belonging and Inclusion Partner, and more.[5] In addition to the core team, others are involved with the coordination of Living Room Conversations. An advisory board services the organization by guiding staff members and other partners. Champions, a unique feature of the organization's structure, are in charge of connecting Living Room Conversations with people, organizations, and events that could utilize its services.  Living Room Conversations relies on funding to conduct its work. Through the help of individual and foundation donors, the organization utilizes donations to finance its events, support its staff, and expand programming. The organization currently receives no government funding, relying primarily on donations to continue the work. For certain events hosted by Living Room Conversations and its staff, a donation is required to attend. The organization urges consultants that use their guides in their work to donate a percentage of their fee; similarly, businesses are requested to ask their finance departments to make an appropriate donation.[6] These donations allow Living Room Conversations to continue creating and distributing resources to non-profits, faith communities, schools, and other organizations in need of increased dialogue.  Specializations, Methods and ToolsServicesLiving Room Conversations offers a multitude of services to help people engage in political discourse. They also offer a consultation option to help users find out which service best fits them. Living Room conversations continue to create custom services for users who request them and are associated with gaining political knowledge. Some of these users include The University of Miami Ohio, Boston Public Library, and UNC Pembroke among others. Some of their listed services include:  ·  Conversation Guide Adaptation -  Users can engage in a 20-minute conversation with a staffer to figure out if the guide they have created for themselves is the best it can be. Staff will advise on what topics need the most attention and advise on talking about touchy subjects in a calm and respectful manner.  ·  Customized Training -  Users can pick what their weaknesses are and work with staff on how to better their conversation skills and promote educational and respectful conversation.  ·  Program Design/Implementation Support -  Staff assists in collecting data to support a conversation as well as evaluating the strength of a potential conversation program.  ·  Host a Conversation -  Once a program is completed, a portal is opened to begin a Zoom conversation on the topics selected. Users can dictate the size of the group they wish while also having access to Living Room Conversations support and the Zoom tech helpline.  ·  Livestream Conversation Event -  Experienced users will have the opportunity to have their conversation co-hosted by an expert. These are often broadcast to new members to show the power of the political discourse they are engaging in. These events are often planned well in advance.  The services offered build upon one another; they continue to help people prepare to have tough conversations. The world continues to be in need of a way to bring people together as we increasingly push each other apart. Undoubtedly, one of the best and most effective tools offered by Living Room Conversations is their conversation guides. Grateful Living states ""They…have over 100 conversation guides based upon the current interests and needs of our users.""[7] These guides provide great information for people wanting to engage in conversation at all levels. It also presents people with an opportunity to pick something they are interested in as they continue to learn.Topic Specific Conversation GuidesAll topic walkthroughs are structured in a similar format. Once a topic is selected, the topic tab will ask open-ended questions for the two conversationalists to consider. For example, on the 'Free Speech' tab, questions are asked about the difference between hate speech and bullying or the effect of technology on free speech.[8] Similarly, the 'Student Debt' tab questions participants about free tuition versus costs to taxpayers.[9] While asking these questions, all topic tabs offer a small background paragraph, introducing the topic and clarifying needed information for discussion. Since all participants may not have the same level of understanding of issues, the beginning of each topic tab allows a small introduction.  After a topic is chosen, a host will begin the online meeting to engage around four to six people in the discussion. The meeting begins with an introduction, setting the tone for the rest of the discussion. Participants get to know each other during a short introductory period. After introductions, all participants will be expected to agree to the conversation agreements. Also found on the website, the conversation agreement outlines specific standards of the discussion, encouraging participants to be curious, respectful, authentic, purposeful, and accountable.  Once the standard of conversation has been set, the discussion of the topic can begin. This part of the conversation is broken down into different rounds based on the topic. The first round is a more in-depth ""get to know you"" between participants. Rather than just an introduction, guests are asked to look a little deeper and explain their goals for not just the conversation but their community and the country. This section also provides time for guests to give additional background on themselves, which may explain why they hold their opinions. Clarifying what drives individuals' perspectives on the world, allows other participants to view each other more holistically, rather than simply judging them based solely on opinions. Through this section of the conversation process, Living Room Conversations provides a guided, structured time for participants to develop trust and understanding with one another.  The largest and most important round is round two. During this section of the conversation, participants begin to get to the heart of the topic. One participant will begin by reading the introductory paragraph mentioned above to the group. From there, each participant chooses one of the offered questions to answer uninterrupted. Within each topic tab, under round two, participants will find different questions about the topic. For example, under the student debt tab, there are five questions that range from economic questions to personal experiences.[10] On the 'Free Speech' tab there are questions about engagement of free speech on social media as well as questions about political correctness.[11] The questions listed on each topic address all sides of the issue. The questions are asked in an unbiased way that allows everyone from either side of the debate to engage with the questions. After each participant has had an opportunity to answer uninterrupted, discussion can begin. Participants are allowed to ask follow-up questions or respond to different answers. Participants will also have a chance to answer or ask questions that are not listed on the topic tab within the confounds of the conversation agreement.  As questioning and discussion wrap up, round three will begin, which encourages guests to reflect on the conversation they had. This round asks participants to reflect on what common ground was found between various perspectives as well as any challenges individuals faced. Once the meeting has ended, participants are asked to give Living Room Conversations feedback about their conversation. This is also a time to exchange contacts between participants to engage in more conversations later.  These guides allow a structured conversation with specific timing. Utilizing structure and timing allows conversations to stay within a given guideline, preventing one participant from dominating the conversation. Living Room Conversations intentionally structures the conversation to encourage listening and reflection, ensuring that participants ""listen five times more than they speak, and both the listening and speaking are reflective, exploratory of self and other, and encouraged by the structure and timing of the conversation to be significantly slower than ordinary engagement, whether face-to-face or online"".[12] Though some participants may find it difficult to speak on charged topics or struggle to share personal opinions, Living Room Conversations provides questions that are designed to encourage guests to feel welcome in sharing their opinion. While the structure of the organization seeks to engage in online or in-person meetings with different guests, anyone is welcome to use these topic guides in any setting. For any individual hoping to engage in an emotionally charged conversation, the conversation agreement, the structured rounds, and pre-determined questions can be used to ease the awkwardness and foster better dialogue.[13]  Major Projects and Events  Most events hosted by Living Room Conversations are facilitated discussions between groups. These conversations' format ranges based upon the specific event. Living Room Conversations hosts staff-led conversations, which are typically conducted online and open to any viewer. Example events include discussing the topic of forgiveness, introductions to Living Room Conversations and its mission, and other trainings intended to encourage thoughtful, civil dialogue.[14] Additionally, anyone can start a conversation themselves by logging into the Living Room Conversations conversation platform, Kazm. Participating hosts can create their own conversations online for other users to join. If an organization or individual prefers to host an in-person conversation, they can utilize pre-made facilitation guides for in-person conversations among local participants.  Living Room Conversations, though run by its staff, champions, and advisory board, relies on the participation of various communities. In particular, the organization highlights many communities and community leaders on its website that contribute to events and partnerships. Faith communities regularly participate in conversations. Living Room Conversations partners with many religious denominations ""to deepen relationships within their communities, address tensions, invite neighbors in and even talk to sister faith communities, both locally and in other states.""[15] Participating congregations participate in regularly scheduled trainings, host dialogues with sister congregations, and discuss difficult topics in a civil, respectful way. For example, Living Room Conversations offers conversation guides specifically for faith communities, including ""Faith in Politics,"" ""Religious Freedom and Non-Discrimination,"" and ""Race and Faith Communities."" At a Christian church in Boise, Idaho, a pastor hosted forty-two members of the congregation in a discussion about abortion, in which the congregation could hear various perspectives and gain insight into their community's members.  Other organizations across the country have also utilized Living Room Conversations and their facilitation guides to promote community inclusion and healthy dialogue. Particularly, policing and community relations with the police can be a difficult topic to tackle; Living Room Conversations offers guides and resources to promote successful discussions between communities with disagreements in this area. Estes Valley Restorative Justice Center in Colorado hosts monthly discussions in partnership with Living Room Conversations, in which local police officers, residents, and Restorative Justice Center members convene to learn from one another.[16] Topics range from gun responsibility, homelessness, and other relevant issues that touch the town of Estes Park.  Schools can also utilize Living Room Conversations through a program titled Allsides for Schools. In collaboration with the National Association for Community Mediation (NAFCM), Living Room Conversations designed a School Community Toolbox designed to lead workshops in skills such as conflict resolution, restorative facilitation, and community dialogues in schools. The program is intended to promote stronger community and constructive discussions in schools, challenging participants to engage critically and build trust with each other. Additionally, the conversations prepare students to thoughtfully participate in democratic processes and allow teachers to facilitate conversations about current events, controversial issues, and other dialogues without bias and division; Living Room Conversations advocates strongly for non-partisan engagement with such issues, stating, ""Allsides for Schools helps educators have these discussions and teach essential skills in critical thinking, collaboration, listening and respectful discourse, media and digital literacy and social-emotional learning. Our unique focus on building relationships and revealing multiple viewpoints across the political spectrum avoids the potential problems with bias and disrespecting individual beliefs.""[17] AllSides for Schools provides specific lesson plans, online tools, and in-class discussion devices that stimulate critical thinking, respectful dialogue, and media literacy. These resources are prepared with middle school, high school, and college ages in mind, as these students are cognitively ready to discuss controversial and political topics.  Similarly, Living Room Conversations partners with libraries across the country to implement conversational programming. Through Living Room Conversations, libraries gain access to conversation guides that can facilitate civil dialogues on relevant topics to the library's local community. Living Room Conversations also offers training prior to facilitations, allowing library staff or volunteers to confidently deliver the facilitation of the conversations. Living Room Conversations can be an ongoing program for the library or a singular event for a topic that a facilitator would like to discuss with library patrons. In a description of the programming, the Colorado Department of Education highlighted an interview in 2023 with Living Room Conversations Libraries Partner, Annie Caplan, who described the organization's library events, stating, ""Living Room Conversations helps libraries offer and support community dialogue programming, deepening the library's role as an engaging, inclusive community center. Our conversation model is designed to build understanding and bridge divides between participants. Living Room Conversations enables libraries to expand their community impact by equipping them with tools to foster relationships and connections between community members and patrons.""[18]  Alongside schools and libraries, businesses and workplaces can engage with Living Room Conversations. As hybrid work models and generational expectations change, Living Room Conversations as an organization highlights the importance of communication and trust among coworkers, especially those with generational gaps. Managers and employees can also benefit from increased dialogue. The structure of Living Room Conversations in businesses is similar to libraries and schools, as the organization provides conversation guides and customizable training to engage workplace leaders in dialogue with other staff.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Living Room Conversations aims to promote healthy dialogue across divides such as political affiliations, age differences, racial backgrounds, and other factors that prevent people from engaging in civil debates. Through guided conversations and facilitation training, the organization hopes to build understanding and trust in communities. Though the effectiveness of these measures is difficult to determine, many participants of the conversations feel like the conversations are productive and offer beneficial lessons. For example, a facilitator in Minnesota who began hosting Living Room Conversations as an organizational development consultant notes the emotional progress that may come from the dialogue, remarking, ""One woman who participated in three conversations said it made her a different and better person. It's not always like that and some people have a less-than-ideal experience, but most people really enjoy it…Conflict that has a goal of connecting people more deeply is good. If you and I have a difficult conversation and we understand each other better — that's good. Conflict that is about ego and power isn't good. I think people are afraid of conflict going awry. But when there is a container for it, like a structured conversation, conflict may be present but it isn't going to swamp the conversation and break whatever tenuous threads connect us.""[19] Although the conversations are not guaranteed to build trust or foster personal growth, participants are granted the structured opportunity to respectfully disagree and learn from one another, which many argue is a positive experience.  At Grace United Methodist Church in Franklin, Indiana, congregation members began facilitating Living Room Conversations as a space for the community to learn how to civilly debate contentious issues. Though the church's monthly meetings are viewed positively and have garnered benefits, the group admitted that the participants tend to have more liberal viewpoints, hindering the conversation from being totally balanced among all political perspectives. Due to participation in Living Room Conversations being voluntary, all viewpoints may not be represented. This lack of equal participation among diverse perspectives may present a challenge to the missions of the conversations. Without participants with opposing political positions, the potential benefits of the discussion may be lost.  References  [1] Shryack, Jessica, et al.

12972,organization,Purpose Power Town Hall Tour,https://participedia.net/organization/12972,Purpose Power created a town hall tour lasting from March-May 2019 to engage citizen discussion about a variety of topics. ,0,2023-12-12,2023-12-12,426026,dallasl,https://participedia.net/user/426026,426026,dallasl,https://participedia.net/user/426026,en,,,,New York,,United States,40.6781784,-73.9441579,non_profit_non_gov,,,,community, deliberative, informal,facilitate, propose, manage,citizenship, political,,media, governance,,," Mission and Purpose  Through her experience in the social sector working on redefining brands and producing events for non-profit organizations and her experience in the political realm assisting in Hilary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, Alicia Bonner Ness witnessed problems in democracy. The main issue she witnessed through her experiences was that lack of effective communication is at the core of the problems the nation faces. [1] She saw just how isolating social media and technology can be because we spend time interacting with people we know, which limits our perspectives on the world. [2] Ness also saw just how toxic “tribal politics” was to political discourse. [3]  Through the Purpose Power Town Halls, Ness hopes to foster communication across people with different perspectives and experiences to “create an open and inviting space in which to envision the better future we all want.” Through facilitating conversation with people across the political spectrum, people can expand their understanding of the world and hopefully use that knowledge to participate in civic engagement. The toolkit provided in the meeting helps participants apply what they learned in their community. [1]Origins and Development  Alicia Bonner Ness founded the Purpose Power Town Hall after leaving the social sector to pursue assisting the Hilary Clinton campaign in 2016, she saw how “our failure to communicate is at the heart of our political dysfunction.” [1]  So, she began facilitating conversations in North Brooklyn. Over the course of 90 minutes, attendees reflected and answered five core questions:What are the values you hope will guide your political leaders?  Name a leader you admire. What qualities make them effective?  What are the qualities of a good civic citizen?  How can leaders and citizens collaborate to strengthen our community?  Imagine you have fallen asleep for ten years and awakened to find that our democracy is thriving. What do you see?After answering them individually, everyone is invited to share their thoughts with the group. The facilitator scribes the responses for all to see. The Brooklyn workshops are a part of the Vision Project, which is a coalition of organizations to envision a future for the Brooklyn community. [1] Ness wanted to expand this discussion to across the nation, which is why she launches the Purpose Power Town Hall Tour, which occurred across 15 cities across 15 states, including: New England, New York, Virgina, North Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Colorado, Kansas, Texas, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Florida. [3]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  One of the biggest challenges for this organization is funding. [2] Alicia Bonner Ness launched a crowdfunding campaign on ifundwomen.com to raise funds for costs associated with the tour, including, venues, staff and operations, promotion, and an “engagement toolkit,” which is given to participants to help continue civic engagement and communication in their community. The campaign is closed and raised $8,150 out of their $75,000 goal. [3]  In the meetings, participants are provided with blank notebooks to collect their thoughts. These notebooks were generously donated by Unruled. [4]  Their May 11th, 2019 Town Hall was co-sponsored by the Serve America Movement (SAM), which is an independent political party designed for those that are fed up with the tribal politics that defines the majority of American politics today. SAM is not focused on candidates or representatives, but rather on people and participation. Their goals focus on policies that give people more power such as voting and gerrymandering reforms. [1]  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The meetings focus on transmitting four core skills: dialogue, understanding, trust, and progress. [3] They are held in public spaces. For example, in Hartford, the event was held at the Hartford Public Library Center for Contemporary Culture. [5]In Nashville, participants met at Bongo Java Cafe. The NYC Town Hall was in the civic hall. In DC attendees met at Open Gov Hub. [6] Each event has three parts. In the first part attendees make meaningful connections, where they engage with others and find shared values. Then, they imagine future possibilities where they join group discussions and collaborate together. The last part is where they commit to take action, promising a future of sustained engagement. Some locations have guest speakers to begin. For example, in Hartford, Dr. Oz Griebel spoke. [1]  The event is free and open to anyone that can come. It is unclear how exactly the cities were chosen, except we can assume that they wanted highly populated cities to encourage civic engagement. Although originally there were 15 selected cities, only three were actually visited, based on the organization's facebook and instagram. [5] [6]  The process of each of the meetings went as follows:Know your neighbor: Each person says their name, where they are from, and a word that describes them.  Establish community guidelines: shape community guidelines that they will adhere to during their time together. Example: using “I” statements discourages generalizing and emphasizes personal experience. These commitments create a sense of community where individuals can feel safe to feel vulnerable and imaginative.  Know your mind, have some fun: Participants can use markers to reflect in notebooks before speaking to the group. Colorful markers help people think imaginatively, which is necessary when discussing the possible future.  Connect with others: Now, people pair up to warm up with a couple of questions. Some of them include: Why are you here? What makes you angry? What are you afraid of? These questions help build trust among the group to continue into more thought-provoking discussion.  Share your values and vision the future: participants then share their most important values in life. After this, leaders invite the group to answer the following question, “Imagine you have fallen asleep for 10 years and awakened to find our democracy thriving. What do you hope to see?”  Be real about the present: Now, participants are invited to acknowledge the obstacles that block the envisioned future. Next, they can create paths to overcome these obstacles and create a future they want to live in.  Commit to solidarity: attendees pair up to commit to take action and check in with each other to ensure they are upholding their commitments. [4]Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Over a 2 month period, Purpose Power connected with almost 200 people from more than 25 states. [5] Although the original plan was to visit 15 states, according to the organization’s Facebook and Instagram, the tour went to three cities: NYC, Hartford, and Washington DC. The attendees all have the tools needed to continue important political discourse in their communities and have connected with other people with similar values and goals.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Overall, Purpose Power Town Hall was successful in facilitating democratic discussion. It provided thought-provoking discussion in an inclusive setting.However, it also shows what lack of funding does for democracy and democratic entities. Without sufficient funds, the tour was unable to be fully completed as the founder had originally planned. Since 2019, there has not been any word of Purpose Power on any forum.

12974,organization,Living Room Conversations,https://participedia.net/organization/12974,Living Room Conversations is a non-profit organization dedicated to guiding political discussions between people with opposing political opinions. ,0,2023-12-12,2023-12-12,426020,allisonpierce12,https://participedia.net/user/426020,426020,allisonpierce12,https://participedia.net/user/426020,en,,,,,,,,,non_profit_non_gov,,,,deliberative, informal, participantled,facilitate, inform,,public_participation,,,education,,,," Mission and Purpose  Living Room Conversations is an organization intended to reverse the polarization and divide in society by encouraging guided conversations between people with countervailing beliefs and backgrounds. More specifically, the organization aims to empower ordinary citizens to engage in respectful dialogue with those of opposing views, thus enabling individuals to garner a more significant understanding of pressing political issues with the hopes of reaching common ground. Through respectful dialogue and consideration of different political opinions, Living Room Conversations fosters more harmonious communities and empathetic individuals.  Describing the benefits of civil dialogue, founders of Living Room Conversations identified the purpose of the discussion format and creation of the organization, writing, “Besides having the time and structure to listen and reflect, specific aspects of Living Room Conversations help to counter stereotypes and enlarge our tribes. For example, it is easier to interrupt stereotypes when we encounter counter-stereotype information and have the time to process it” [1]. By providing a structured format for conversation, Living Room Conversations allows individuals to actively listen to others and share their own opinions within a safe, controlled setting. The organization offers citizens a platform and tool to not only build greater understanding but also build meaningful and mutually respectful relationships. This mission of counteracting the growing polarization from political affiliations in the United States seeks to encourage a more respectful, civil society based on intercommunal and intracommunal conversations.  The organization's name originates from the idea that living rooms are often considered a place of gathering and socializing. When a person receives an invite into someone else’s home, they generally feel respected and valued, promoting respectful conversation [2]. While the living  room is assumed to be a physical location, modern technology allows people to connect with others through virtual platforms. With these new forms of communication, Living Room Conversations can build communities of understanding and growth both in-person and online, transforming the typical definition of “living room.”  Origins and Development  Founded in 2010, Living Room Conversations is a non-profit organization which promotes healthy dialogue and political discussion. The organization’s founders, noting the lack of civil dialogue on political problems and increasing polarization in American culture, sought to use simple, structured conversations to build empathy and understanding. The founding members believed that while disagreement is inevitable, this disagreement should not lead to hopeless divides. Instead, Living Room Conversations sought to harness these fundamental differences to empower community members to seek better solutions in difficult circumstances. Moreover, founder Joan Blades teamed up with other dialogue experts to “create a structured, intimate conversation format that would empower everyday citizens to discuss important issues with friends of differing political affiliations and backgrounds” [3]. They believed that if individuals engaged in a discussion where the intent and structure were disclosed, the dialogue would produce an atmosphere founded on respect and worthwhile transmission of ideas. Additionally, this personal, conversational format could breed new, long-lasting relationships amongst participants and encourage further discussion between dissenting individuals. By early 2011, the tested format of Living Room Conversations proved to succeed in creating more respectful, understanding dialogue surrounding controversial topics.  Following the pilot's success, Joan Blades and Amanda Kathryn Roman joined forces to form a partnership and continue to promote the mission of Living Room Conversations. They  hired an advisory board and established a website to launch Living Room Conversations, creating an accessible format for individuals, small groups, and larger organizations. The platform attracted its first notable conversation in 2013. This discussion was co-hosted by Joan Blades and Mark Meckler, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, finding common ground on controversial issues such as criminal justice reform and the harms of capitalism. Moreover, Living Room Conversations constantly adapts and expands, introducing new topics and partnering with new organizations. Particularly, the ability to conduct Living Room Conversations through online formats as well as in-person events allows the organization to collaborate with more participants in new ways, bridging divides between people from all areas of the United States [5].  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Living Room Conversations structures itself around a core team, which is composed of executive directors, administrative managers, community engagement directors, and other organizational staff. These staff members run the administrative and outreach sides of the organization, coordinating with outside organizations and events to bring the Living Room Conversations to them. Positions include Community Engagement Partner, Youth Council Leader, Social Media Manager, Belonging and Inclusion Partner, and more.[5] In addition to the core team, others are involved with the coordination of Living Room Conversations. An advisory board services the organization by guiding staff members and other partners. Champions, a unique feature of the organization's structure, are in charge of connecting Living Room Conversations with people, organizations, and events that could utilize its services.  Living Room Conversations relies on funding to conduct its work. Through the help of individual and foundation donors, the organization utilizes donations to finance its events, support its staff, and expand programming. The organization currently receives no government funding, relying primarily on donations to continue the work. For certain events hosted by Living Room Conversations and its staff, a donation is required to attend. The organization urges consultants that use their guides in their work to donate a percentage of their fee; similarly, businesses are requested to ask their finance departments to make an appropriate donation.[6] These donations allow Living Room Conversations to continue creating and distributing resources to non-profits, faith communities, schools, and other organizations in need of increased dialogue.  Specializations, Methods and ToolsServicesLiving Room Conversations offers a multitude of services to help people engage in political discourse. They also offer a consultation option to help users find out which service best fits them. Living Room conversations continue to create custom services for users who request them and are associated with gaining political knowledge. Some of these users include The University of Miami Ohio, Boston Public Library, and UNC Pembroke among others. Some of their listed services include:  ·  Conversation Guide Adaptation -  Users can engage in a 20-minute conversation with a staffer to figure out if the guide they have created for themselves is the best it can be. Staff will advise on what topics need the most attention and advise on talking about touchy subjects in a calm and respectful manner.  ·  Customized Training -  Users can pick what their weaknesses are and work with staff on how to better their conversation skills and promote educational and respectful conversation.  ·  Program Design/Implementation Support -  Staff assists in collecting data to support a conversation as well as evaluating the strength of a potential conversation program.  ·  Host a Conversation -  Once a program is completed, a portal is opened to begin a Zoom conversation on the topics selected. Users can dictate the size of the group they wish while also having access to Living Room Conversations support and the Zoom tech helpline.  ·  Livestream Conversation Event -  Experienced users will have the opportunity to have their conversation co-hosted by an expert. These are often broadcast to new members to show the power of the political discourse they are engaging in. These events are often planned well in advance.  The services offered build upon one another; they continue to help people prepare to have tough conversations. The world continues to be in need of a way to bring people together as we increasingly push each other apart. Undoubtedly, one of the best and most effective tools offered by Living Room Conversations is their conversation guides. Grateful Living states ""They...have over 100 conversation guides based upon the current interests and needs of our users.""[7] These guides provide great information for people wanting to engage in conversation at all levels. It also presents people with an opportunity to pick something they are interested in as they continue to learn.Topic Specific Conversation GuidesAll topic walkthroughs are structured in a similar format. Once a topic is selected, the topic tab will ask open-ended questions for the two conversationalists to consider. For example, on the 'Free Speech' tab, questions are asked about the difference between hate speech and bullying or the effect of technology on free speech.[8] Similarly, the 'Student Debt' tab questions participants about free tuition versus costs to taxpayers.[9] While asking these questions, all topic tabs offer a small background paragraph, introducing the topic and clarifying needed information for discussion. Since all participants may not have the same level of understanding of issues, the beginning of each topic tab allows a small introduction.  After a topic is chosen, a host will begin the online meeting to engage around four to six people in the discussion. The meeting begins with an introduction, setting the tone for the rest of the discussion. Participants get to know each other during a short introductory period. After introductions, all participants will be expected to agree to the conversation agreements. Also found on the website, the conversation agreement outlines specific standards of the discussion, encouraging participants to be curious, respectful, authentic, purposeful, and accountable.  Once the standard of conversation has been set, the discussion of the topic can begin. This part of the conversation is broken down into different rounds based on the topic. The first round is a more in-depth ""get to know you"" between participants. Rather than just an introduction, guests are asked to look a little deeper and explain their goals for not just the conversation but their community and the country. This section also provides time for guests to give additional background on themselves, which may explain why they hold their opinions. Clarifying what drives individuals' perspectives on the world, allows other participants to view  each other more holistically, rather than simply judging them based solely on opinions. Through this section of the conversation process, Living Room Conversations provides a guided, structured time for participants to develop trust and understanding with one another.  The largest and most important round is round two. During this section of the conversation, participants begin to get to the heart of the topic. One participant will begin by reading the introductory paragraph mentioned above to the group. From there, each participant chooses one of the offered questions to answer uninterrupted. Within each topic tab, under round two, participants will find different questions about the topic. For example, under the student debt tab, there are five questions that range from economic questions to personal experiences.[10] On the 'Free Speech' tab there are questions about engagement of free speech on social media as well as questions about political correctness.[11] The questions listed on each topic address all sides of the issue. The questions are asked in an unbiased way that allows everyone from either side of the debate to engage with the questions. After each participant has had an opportunity to answer uninterrupted, discussion can begin. Participants are allowed to ask follow-up questions or respond to different answers. Participants will also have a chance to answer or ask questions that are not listed on the topic tab within the confounds of the conversation agreement.  As questioning and discussion wrap up, round three will begin, which encourages guests to reflect on the conversation they had. This round asks participants to reflect on what common ground was found between various perspectives as well as any challenges individuals faced. Once the meeting has ended, participants are asked to give Living Room Conversations feedback about their conversation. This is also a time to exchange contacts between participants to engage in more conversations later.  These guides allow a structured conversation with specific timing. Utilizing structure and timing allows conversations to stay within a given guideline, preventing one participant from dominating the conversation. Living Room Conversations intentionally structures the conversation to encourage listening and reflection, ensuring that participants ""listen five times more than they speak, and both the listening and speaking are reflective, exploratory of self and other, and encouraged by the structure and timing of the conversation to be significantly slower than ordinary engagement, whether face-to-face or online"".[12] Though some participants may find it difficult to speak on charged topics or struggle to share personal opinions, Living Room Conversations provides questions that are designed to encourage guests to feel welcome in sharing their opinion. While the structure of the organization seeks to engage in online or in- person meetings with different guests, anyone is welcome to use these topic guides in any setting. For any individual hoping to engage in an emotionally charged conversation, the conversation agreement, the structured rounds, and pre-determined questions can be used to ease the awkwardness and foster better dialogue.[13]  Major Projects and Events  Most events hosted by Living Room Conversations are facilitated discussions between groups. These conversations' format ranges based upon the specific event. Living Room Conversations hosts staff-led conversations, which are typically conducted online and open to any viewer. Example events include discussing the topic of forgiveness, introductions to Living Room Conversations and its mission, and other trainings intended to encourage thoughtful, civil dialogue.[14] Additionally, anyone can start a conversation themselves by logging into the Living Room Conversations conversation platform, Kazm. Participating hosts can create their  own conversations online for other users to join. If an organization or individual prefers to host an in-person conversation, they can utilize pre-made facilitation guides for in-person conversations among local participants.  Living Room Conversations, though run by its staff, champions, and advisory board, relies on the participation of various communities. In particular, the organization highlights many communities and community leaders on its website that contribute to events and partnerships. Faith communities regularly participate in conversations. Living Room Conversations partners with many religious denominations ""to deepen relationships within their communities, address tensions, invite neighbors in and even talk to sister faith communities, both locally and in other states.""[15] Participating congregations participate in regularly scheduled trainings, host dialogues with sister congregations, and discuss difficult topics in a civil, respectful way. For example, Living Room Conversations offers conversation guides specifically for faith communities, including ""Faith in Politics,"" ""Religious Freedom and Non-Discrimination,"" and ""Race and Faith Communities."" At a Christian church in Boise, Idaho, a pastor hosted forty-two members of the congregation in a discussion about abortion, in which the congregation could hear various perspectives and gain insight into their community's members.  Other organizations across the country have also utilized Living Room Conversations and their facilitation guides to promote community inclusion and healthy dialogue. Particularly, policing and community relations with the police can be a difficult topic to tackle; Living Room Conversations offers guides and resources to promote successful discussions between communities with disagreements in this area. Estes Valley Restorative Justice Center in Colorado hosts monthly discussions in partnership with Living Room Conversations, in which local police officers, residents, and Restorative Justice Center members convene to learn from  one another.[16] Topics range from gun responsibility, homelessness, and other relevant issues that touch the town of Estes Park.  Schools can also utilize Living Room Conversations through a program titled Allsides for Schools. In collaboration with the National Association for Community Mediation (NAFCM), Living Room Conversations designed a School Community Toolbox designed to lead workshops in skills such as conflict resolution, restorative facilitation, and community dialogues in schools. The program is intended to promote stronger community and constructive discussions in schools, challenging participants to engage critically and build trust with each other. Additionally, the conversations prepare students to thoughtfully participate in democratic processes and allow teachers to facilitate conversations about current events, controversial issues, and other dialogues without bias and division; Living Room Conversations advocates strongly for non-partisan engagement with such issues, stating, ""Allsides for Schools helps educators have these discussions and teach essential skills in critical thinking, collaboration, listening and respectful discourse, media and digital literacy and social-emotional learning. Our unique focus on building relationships and revealing multiple viewpoints across the political spectrum avoids the potential problems with bias and disrespecting individual beliefs.""[17] AllSides for Schools provides specific lesson plans, online tools, and in-class discussion devices that stimulate critical thinking, respectful dialogue, and media literacy. These resources are prepared with middle school, high school, and college ages in mind, as these students are cognitively ready to discuss controversial and political topics.  Similarly, Living Room Conversations partners with libraries across the country to implement conversational programming. Through Living Room Conversations, libraries gain access to conversation guides that can facilitate civil dialogues on relevant topics to the library's  local community. Living Room Conversations also offers training prior to facilitations, allowing library staff or volunteers to confidently deliver the facilitation of the conversations. Living Room Conversations can be an ongoing program for the library or a singular event for a topic that a facilitator would like to discuss with library patrons. In a description of the programming, the Colorado Department of Education highlighted an interview in 2023 with Living Room Conversations Libraries Partner, Annie Caplan, who described the organization's library events, stating, ""Living Room Conversations helps libraries offer and support community dialogue programming, deepening the library's role as an engaging, inclusive community center. Our conversation model is designed to build understanding and bridge divides between participants. Living Room Conversations enables libraries to expand their community impact by equipping them with tools to foster relationships and connections between community members and patrons.""[18]  Alongside schools and libraries, businesses and workplaces can engage with Living Room Conversations. As hybrid work models and generational expectations change, Living Room Conversations as an organization highlights the importance of communication and trust among coworkers, especially those with generational gaps. Managers and employees can also benefit from increased dialogue. The structure of Living Room Conversations in businesses is similar to libraries and schools, as the organization provides conversation guides and customizable training to engage workplace leaders in dialogue with other staff.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Living Room Conversations aims to promote healthy dialogue across divides such as political affiliations, age differences, racial backgrounds, and other factors that prevent people  from engaging in civil debates. Through guided conversations and facilitation training, the organization hopes to build understanding and trust in communities. Though the effectiveness of these measures is difficult to determine, many participants of the conversations feel like the conversations are productive and offer beneficial lessons. For example, a facilitator in Minnesota who began hosting Living Room Conversations as an organizational development consultant notes the emotional progress that may come from the dialogue, remarking, ""One woman who participated in three conversations said it made her a different and better person. It's not always like that and some people have a less-than-ideal experience, but most people really enjoy it...Conflict that has a goal of connecting people more deeply is good. If you and I have a difficult conversation and we understand each other better — that's good. Conflict that is about ego and power isn't good. I think people are afraid of conflict going awry. But when there is a container for it, like a structured conversation, conflict may be present but it isn't going to swamp the conversation and break whatever tenuous threads connect us.""[19] Although the conversations are not guaranteed to build trust or foster personal growth, participants are granted the structured opportunity to respectfully disagree and learn from one another, which many argue is a positive experience.  At Grace United Methodist Church in Franklin, Indiana, congregation members began facilitating Living Room Conversations as a space for the community to learn how to civilly debate contentious issues. Though the church's monthly meetings are viewed positively and have garnered benefits, the group admitted that the participants tend to have more liberal viewpoints, hindering the conversation from being totally balanced among all political perspectives. Due to participation in Living Room Conversations being voluntary, all viewpoints may not be represented. This lack of equal participation among diverse perspectives may present a challenge  to the missions of the conversations. Without participants with opposing political positions, the potential benefits of the discussion may be lost.  References  [1] Shryack, Jessica, et al.

Voice operates in a context where civic space and power is shifting at a fast pace, and often closing rather than opening. Where the narrative is negative and underlining marginalisation and vulnerability, rather than the dreams and successful steps made towards a better, more inclusive world.Voice is implemented in ten countries in Africa and Asia.  Voice is an initiative of and financed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands as part of their overall policy framework ‘Dialogue and Dissent’ (future Power of Voices) and is executed by a consortium between Oxfam Novib and Hivos. Hivos is the coordinated body in four countries: Indonesia, Philippines, Kenya and Tanzania , while Oxfam coordinates Voice in six: Laos, Cambodia, Uganda, Niger, Mali and Nigeria.  About Hivos  Hivos is an international organisation that seeks new solutions to persistent global issues. With smart projects in the right places, they oppose discrimination, inequality, abuse of power and the unsustainable use of the planet’s resources. Counterbalance alone, however, is not enough. Hivos’ primary focus is achieving structural change. This is why Hivos cooperates with innovative businesses, citizens and their organisations. Hivos shares a dream with them of sustainable economies and inclusive societies. More about HivosAbout Oxfam Novib  Oxfam Novib is part of a global confederation of people working together to end the injustice of poverty for everyone. They help people build better lives for themselves, and when disasters strike they save and rebuild lives. Together they take on the big issues that keep people poor, such as inequality, discrimination against women, climate change, and the eviction of people from their land. And they won’t stop until every person on the planet can enjoy life free from poverty. Their vision is a just world without poverty. More about Oxfam Novib.Roles Oxfam and Hivos  Hivos and Oxfam Novib have formed a consortium to implement Voice, combining the strengths of both organisations:Oxfam Novib and Hivos together manage over 1,500 grants a year, including capacity strengthening, innovation and investment grants.
